"ubereats charged me for a successful chargeback i filed a chargeback with my credit card (after one horrible incident where i had documented everything through screenshots. this was after hundreds of orders and thousands of dollars spent with ubereats). my credit card credited my money back and received a letter in the mail from my credit card company. however, after that, i got charged by ubereats for the exact same amount that i was refunded through my credit card company. has anyone else had that happen to them? what do i do next? should i cut my losses and move on?",2025-04-20 20:50:04,1,2,Reddit,UberEats
"ubereats driver scammed me by buying half the stuff i ordered what the title says. i ordered uber shopper from ranch and the guy legit only got half of what i ordered and i was charged the same amount. and i cant even call him again or call customer support because their number says “sorry we’re no longer accepting calls at this number”. their in-app chatbot is as good as useless since everyone there talks like ai and closes the chat whenever you’re about to make your point.

"ubereats why you do this? family went out of town for easter, i couldn't go due to work so i decided to treat myself (and avoid being sad woman eating in a restaurant by herself) to my favorite bbq restaurant about 4 miles from my house. 

only uber routed me to the location nearly 45 minutes away. there was no good reason  ... the one close to me was taking ue orders.  

the driver is a sweetheart (they said they live close to me and this was their last run of the night)  ... but now i need to triple the tip for cold food. fortunately i have cash so i don't have to trust the app to give them the extra. but  ue, this sucks. :(

update: yep, it was cold, though driver did have an insulated bag. at least they were right about living nearby ... they are in the same subdivision.  ",2025-04-20 20:19:15,1,3,Reddit,UberEats

"ubereats keeps asking me for my vehicle insurance and i have sent it to them about 12 times. i am a driver on my dad‘s insurance. ubereats keeps asking me for my insurance and i have sent it to them about 12 times, i am a driver on my dad's insurance and my name is clearly on the insurance and my insurance is not expired or anything. i keep getting a message saying that my name is not on the insurance and that the name does not match. i have noticed that other people have had this issue as well. i even blew up my name really big on the second picture and sent it to them. i don't know if they are just trying to get rid of me and other drivers...when i am one of the top producing ubereats drivers but this is ridiculous. another thing is that it says on their page that after 20 uber trips they take away the steep $20 early cash out fee. i hit 25 ubereats trips and they did not remove the fee. i tried calling several numbers and they were all disconnected. i finally got a hold of a live person through a live chat and at the time the person told me that i only had 13 completed trips, which was not true. i screenshot that i had 31 completed trips at the time and sent it to her, she then told me that they must have a glitch on their end and to sign off the app then turn my phone off and on and then it should be fixed. i asked her to stay on the chat while i did that and she seemed frustrated. she said she would get back to me in a few days. i then pleaded with her to please stay on the chat, it seems like they cannot wait to get off the chat with you when you do get through to someone. i did as she told me to do and she disappeared from the chat. i am now at 45 completed uber trips and they still have not removed the $20 cash out fee which is a lot of money from ubereats, that is pretty much all of my tips since they pay so poorly. i got a hold of another person through a live chat and they told me that it would be escalated to an it team. it has been a week and nothing has happened. the problem has not been resolved. it seems ubereats has glitches that work to their own benefit. i feel like taking them to court and suing them for all the crap they make up and how shady and crooked they are.

"ue customers: mcdelivery will likely be cancelled between 2:30am and 4:00am. mcdonalds....

depending on your region/state/nation, they have a set time of the morning when they switch off their lunch/dinner menu and switch on breakfast, as well as the opposite.

in northern illinois, most of the mcdonalds have switched to a 3am switchover to breakfast and a 10:30am switch over to lunch, with weekends being an 11am switch over to lunch.

so please look at the time before you order between 2:30 and 4:00am. if the mcapp/ue/dd menu lists lunch items, refresh until you see the breakfast menu pop up. if the breakfast menu does not pop up, then the site has not been alerted to the change in breakfast hours.

the average ue driver takes 5-10 mins to arrive at the restaurant, meaning by the time you have selected your items, processed payment, and the order has been routed to a restaurant, it may already be too late.

over the past 3 months, i have cancelled over 50 mcdelivery orders due to the customer ordering lunch/dinner during breakfast hours. you may have ordered legitimately before the restaurant switched to breakfast, but by the time the driver arrives, all lunch menu items are in the dumpster.

the manager will deny, shake their head, tell us to go away. all we can do is let you know you ordered too late or just cancel it on you.

this is also why - if you order mcd's lunch/dinner between 2:30am and 4:00am - you will see 2-4 different drivers accept then cancel your order. it will happen a dozen times before ue actually cancels, or someone like me who understands this and goes out of their way to contact support to explain and have your lunch order permanently cancelled.

will you get a refund? idk. that's between you and uber.",2025-04-20 04:52:55,1,1,Reddit,UberEats

"uber eats said 20 minutes, 90 minutes later i’m sitting here with 2 apple pies and the ghost of a mcflurry that never was. i ordered mcdonald’s tonight, not for sustenance, but for the sacred, dairy-churned glory of a goddamn mcflurry.
uber eats said 20 minutes.
reality said “sit down, peasant.”

over 90 minutes later, what arrives?
two cold, soggy apple pies that taste like regret and industrial sadness.

no mcflurry.
no apology.
just the haunting whisper of “give zoe time to drop off your order…”
zoe, if you’re reading this, i hope you’re okay.
but my soul isn’t.

i reach out to support and they say:
“it’ll arrive by 8:45 am.”
it’s 11 pm. i didn’t order a continental breakfast.

tried to cancel. the bot offered “order status,” “will my food be cold?” (it is), and “contact driver” (i would, but i think they transcended).
eventually, i get to a human named sanyam who copy-pasted the words “we understand your disappointment” with all the compassion of a dmv printer jamming.

they closed the chat.
no refund. no mcflurry. no justice. just “stay safe and healthy.”
i aged 6 years during this process. my fries are now eligible for social security.

"shout out richard i had an interaction today that i want to call out with a driver. he was very nice when he dropped my order off. i thought the restaurant had forgotten one of my kids foods and instead of having uber eats refund like they usually do, i connected with richard to see if maybe they forgot a bag. he said “i told them like 5 times to make sure they had everything. give me your address, call the restaurant and i’ll run back over there and get it.” which i’m confident is something no one ever does. 

i called the restaurant and not only did i have the wrong location(farther from my house) but it also turns out i erred and forgot to add the item to my order. i reached out to customer service and desperately was trying to get a hold of the driver but they couldn’t help and the order was closed so i couldn’t reach him. i went back and added 50% more to the tip basically hoping he would soon find out i’m an idiot and go about his day. 

about an hour later he shows up with a bag. tells me he went back to the restaurant and argued with them for like 10 minutes. i explained what happened, apologized profusely and offered him some extra cash for my mistake and wasting his time. he declined, wished me a happy easter, and handed me a bag and said “here’s dessert for the kids”. 

unreal. i just stood in my door half stunned wanting to cry. what a beautiful person.

"multiapping should be forbidden it already happened multiple times that i saw my driver pick up my order, and turn a 4 min drive into a 15-25 min drive by just going off into some weird direction opposite to mine. stand still for like 5-10 min and then resume the drive somewhere else before delivering me my food.

it's cold by the time it arrives. i still pay full price, i even tip these guys out of sheer generosity.

but not this time, as soon as this guy arrives i'll take my food and just close the door cause i'm sick of this.

i don't pay for my food to take a scenic trip around the city. might just stop using uber eats all together. was a short relationship since the only thing that made me use it was the ""shorter delivery times"" compared to other services. but if they allow them to multiapp and just take my order off route... nah, i ain't paying you guys anymore for that. could get the food myself faster at this point


edit:

so i ordered at 19:50

at around 20:00 my order was picked up

it should have been delivered at 20:05 give or take a couple of min (the restaurant is near me)

it's 20:30 and it arrived, the guy sitting downstairs not even ringing my bell, instead i have to go all the way down to street level and pick it up myself 👍



yeah this was our last ride 😂 thanks for the cold food, thank god i'm smart enough to preheat the oven


edit2:

don't come at me with ""they can't forbid us from multiapping""

we are our own bosses....


yeah i know the job sucks, should have made better choices i guess. but saying i am my own boss and they can't forbid it ...

yeah buddy sry to be the harbor of bad news, but if you actually were your own boss, with that mentality and client satisfaction... you wouldn't have a business for long.


the only reason you still working is because of the layer of abstraction between you and the client. 

edit3:

ok so where i live tipping in cash is preferred since tipping over app gets pooled and taxed on payout. so yeah everyone around here tip in cash.

this guy definitely was multiapping since if it was an uber native order, it would have been accounted for in the app, like the previous drop off.

if you actually had read the contract you signed with uber you would know multiapping during active deliveries is forbidden. only because you are a contractor doesn't mean you can't be held accountable, you are not your own boss... you probably are, uneducated, unskilled, with a mess of a life.


why not pick it up myself or make the food myself ?
i actually usually do, but i'm the head chef of multiple restaurant, had a 14 hour shift behind me, haven't eaten anything, because i didn't even get to have a real pause for that time, you guys probably don't understand what real work is like.
so yeah if i get another abdullah al abdahar that takes my food for a scenic drive i will probably just not tip them at all instead of reducing his tip.



interacting with people on this post made me realize one thing:

people working this job are miserable, in every facet of their life, dumb, unskilled and uneducated. yeah there are a few exceptions that because of unfortunate circumstances now work this job, but that's an exception, not the rule.

enjoy your ""below minimum wage job"". i guess thats what you get for being your own ""boss""

"uber eats hello everyone, this post may explain a little why uber eats drivers sometimes behave irresponsibly towards the client when they throw away or deliver in a damaged condition. the thing is that an uber eats driver can sometimes work 12 hours a day, delivering food by car, and earn $200 for these 12 hours, you also need to subtract gasoline and car maintenance, uber also takes its interest, and so calculate for 12 hours on your car you earn $120-130. therefore, sometimes drivers who went there out of desperation, due to the lack of work in general, uber is not a company with guarantees, drivers do not pass an interview, support is at a low level, and the system itself is not perfect. and it turns out that for $130 for 12 hours, no one wants to work, but only out of desperation due to the lack of funds and work in  overall, uber describes the whole mess of modern canada, and the liberal government that has driven its people to despair.",2025-04-18 07:01:52,0,4,Reddit,UberEats

"why your delivery may be a minute late i’ve got 100% satisfaction rate, but only a 97% on time rate. 

i thought some of the eaters here would like to know why sometimes the food can’t come faster:

i’m not taking toll roads. uber will estimate how fast your food can arrive based on the toll road time, but i’m not spending $1.50+ on tolls that uber ain’t paying for. 

also, sometimes the app is just wrong. like the night uber was saying my drop off was on a busy road to the right that was actually a wall barrier to a bunch of apartment complexes and then, once you get to where you can drive into the apartment complex parking lot, i had to drive into 4 different parking lots until i found the right one! and then i had to find the right building for that person’s apartment. the whole time the app’s binging telling me to go back out to the wall. i got my steps in on that tiny box of cookies delivery.

"received my third thumbs down today currently lying down in my room right now, i haven't been this stressed out in my life.

about a few months ago, i got my first thumbs down. i waited at mcdonald's for about an hour until i get an order because it's australia day and the store was very busy. i asked the employee three times when my order will be ready, which seems to annoy them too much and they gave me a thumbs down.

the second thumbs down was completely random, and it's the thing that bugs me to this very day. it just happened one day and i couldn't figure out what was wrong about it.

on that day, someone called my phone while i was in the middle of handling an order, so i accepted the call because i thought that was from another customer. turns out the caller pressed a wrong number, i was incredibly unlucky to get something like this.

and then, the next day after that, my scooter which i used to deliver got stolen. and on that same day the thumbs-down finally got updated on my end, it was the second worst day of my life... so far.

ever since then, i have consistent nightmares, sometimes it's about checking my phone and see my rating drop, sometimes it's getting hit by a car, sometimes it's a flashback of me coming down from my apartment and see my missing scooter and a lock on the ground. my hair is falling off, i have constant stomachaches, i lost probably around 5 kilos in weight alone. i have no idea why a simple gig job is causinge so much stress like this.

here's the thing, i have adhd and anxiety, which means finding a regular job is next to impossible. i don't have skills nor any experience at anything at all, so right now, uber eats is my only lifeline. if i'm this stressed out doing a simple job, then i feel like i won't be suited for something more advanced, like literally anything else besides this.

what do i need to do to stop this from happening in the future? right now, i'm applying for other jobs but i got no reply as always. should i stay unemployed for the rest of my life? i'm really worried that the next person i deliver to will give the last thumbs down that will deactivate my account.

i have 33 customers thumbs up, 2 thumbs down, and one merchant thumbs down. i have 305 deliveries in total, sitting at 92% approval rating right now.

i can't view my acceptance rate for some reason, but keep in mind that i'm in the australian market. tipping culture isn't a thing over here, so it's impossible to tell which order is trustworthy and which isn't. i just accept every order that pops up, but i do avoid anything from mcdonald's.",2025-04-18 01:39:32,2,2,Reddit,UberEats

"replaced drivers? the other day i ordered from a fast food place near me. i got a delivery driver assigned, and when the food was ready and the driver was shown as having arrived at the restaurant, i got a new delivery driver. this happened multiple times with this order (i got a total of 4 drivers assigned before ultimately canceling). 

this was weird to me because every single time, the driver would get to the restaurant, and then i’d be assigned a new driver. i’ve only ever experienced this with one driver changing (and i get that stuff happens - i don’t fault drivers who may change their mind, or accept accidentally then decline, everyone has their reasons and i’m a generally very patient and understanding person.) 

my honest thought is that something bad must have happened at the restaurant if four separate people accepted, then declined upon arrival at the restaurant. i ended up ordering from somewhere else but i’m just wondering if anyone has any thoughts? the app was working so it wasn’t a glitch/bug of some kind, i tip well, the distance wasn’t too far, etc. my assumption is there must have been some kind of emergency, like a violent person or a medical emergency or something because if i was a delivery driver and pulled up to a restaurant and saw police, ambulance, violence, etc. i’d probably decline the order and leave. but i’m just wondering if there is any other possibility i’m not considering that isn’t an emergency. 

mostly i just hope those drivers are okay and if it was truly an emergency, that everything has been resolved and the people involved are okay. (i have anxiety and c-ptsd so my brain is assuming the worst when it may not have been this serious). ",2025-04-17 19:16:16,1,6,Reddit,UberEats

"cases of water (multiple) a minimum of six times a week, i have to cancel pickup orders. specifically, shop and pay trips as well as grocery pickups and deliveries. i don't know why so many people insist on purchasing the 35 pack or the 48 pack of bottled waters in multiple quantities. 

i know i've mentioned this before in other posts and comments, but i just declined a $35 tip on a grocery order that obviously has been passed around to other drivers because it's less than a 4 mile drive. 

it was not a shop and pay but a grocery pickup. i walked in, grabbed a cart, went to the drive up and go department, and immediately recoiled. 

directly in front of me were two carts stacked taller than me with 35 pack 16.9 oz bottled water. i'm 6'3 and it wasn't the height but the weight as both of the carts looked like they were about to fall over or crumple under the mass of that plastic filled with water. 

i can understand mom and pop shops as well as schools that order multiple packs of water for kids - or for sale, but ordering from a local grocery store and expecting an uber eats delivery driver to bring you what amounts to 300 lb or more of bottles is insane.

i can lift each individual case of water, but i refuse to climb stairs with them more than five or six steps, i refuse to haul them around, especially when i have to walk the length of a football field carrying each one.

"the $5 / 5mi rule something i've started doing lately is practicing what i call the 5/5 rule. that's a $5 minimum for any delivery and a maximum of 5 miles distance including the drive to pick up the order.

it eliminates all those $2 and $3 orders, which i completely ignore or tap the x to decline. it also helps me to stay within a reasonable driving distance from my home and base territory.

especially since i live near chicago, where a minimum 25% of all deliveries are uber saying let's drive 25 miles to go to downtown chicago, pay $25 in parking fees and take the toll roads which will cost you an additional $10. oh and the delivery fee that you receive is $6 at most.

i don't do deliveries where i lose money. i'm sure a lot of drivers agree with that. because what's the point of doing the job if it's going to cost you more than you earn?

and that's the base line for me. a minimum five dollars for any delivery and a maximum distance of 5 miles. rarely do i take anything less than $5 and i always refuse anything more than 5 mi. and i always refuse anything that heads toward chicago downtown.

anyone else have this policy or something similar?

\-----------------------------------------------------------

edit:

since some people did not read this correctly: the **bare minimum is $5.00**.

i know some regions have customers who regularly tip much more than that, but a lot of the uber eats ordering chicagoans (not all, but a lot) seem to be cheapskates. on average, i see $1-$3 orders 50% of the time, $4-$6 30% of the time, and more than $7 only about 20% of the time. more = better, as long as the distance is not insane.

i agree $2 per mile is awesome, but realistically, if i only took $2 per mile or greater, i would not work more than an hour a week.",2025-04-17 07:42:39,0,32,Reddit,UberEats

i called support multiple time to get them to cancel the order but they said there was nothing they could go and i should wait for the door to get to me. no matter how many times i reiterated that i lived a whole state away they refused to listen. when i asked to speak to someone above them they said there was no one. 

when the delivery driver arrived at the location she told me she was confused as well because it said my address in the state i live in. it would have taken her four to five hours to reach me. she then proceeded to hang up on me while i was taking. drove away from some apartment building and marked it as delivered. 

after i contacted them and they said the delivery driver informed them it was delivered and there was nothing they could do. 

i tried to dispute the charge on cashapp but it says pending transaction and even after i put in a dispute they have not reached out to me. and yesterday i received and email telling my i should have contacted them within 48 hours which i did.

"is uber really stealing my money? so yesterday (april 15th) i placed a pickup order from sonic. when i arrived at the restaurant, i was told very rudely by an employee that my order wasn’t in their system. after going back and forth on it for almost 10 minutes i finally gave up and left without my order. i messaged support immediately and was told i couldn’t get a refund. i’ve since tried 3 other times because each agent kept considering the order as delivery, which definitely wasn’t the case. i don’t understand why they want to completely ignore what i said and just immediately say i’m not eligible for a refund.

i figured with how the employee was treating me, that alone would be enough to warrant a refund. it was literally 4 medium milkshakes, not even a complicated order.

quick summary: restaurant screwed me over on order, support refuses to refund me for items i never physically received. what should i do? contacted 4 times total. lost $30. i’m both a driver and a customer so i’m worried i’m gonna jeopardize my job if i keep arguing with the dang bots and the support agents who can’t read.",2025-04-16 23:34:48,4,36,Reddit,UberEats

"uber: faq for getting payment on the $200m investor settlement hey guys, i posted about this settlement before, but since they’re still accepting late claims, i decided to share it again with a little faq.



if you don’t remember, in 2019, uber was accused of bypassing local regulations in many areas and ignoring serious safety issues, including sexual assaults, deaths from crashes, and fatal assaults before the ipo.





the good news is that uber settled $200m with investors, and they’re accepting late claims.





so here is a little faq for this settlement:      

  

q. who can claim this settlement?

a. anyone who purchased or otherwise acquired uber’s publicly traded common stock pursuant and/or traceable to the offering documents for uber’s ipo.







q. do i need to sell/lose my shares to get this settlement?

a. no, if you purchased $uber during the class period, you are eligible to file a claim.







q. how long does the payout process take?

a. it typically takes 8 to 12 months after the claim deadline for payouts to be processed, depending on the court and settlement administration.



you can check if you are eligible and file a claim here: [http://11th.com/cases/uber-investor-settlement](http://11th.com/cases/uber-investor-settlement) ",2025-04-16 14:08:17,1,4,Reddit,UberEats

"should i leave a bad review? i just had a uber eats delivery driver who was flat out incompetent. i live in an apartment and understand how confusing they are (i used to deliver for door dash) but in the notes section i include exactly where to park, exactly where to enter the building, the code to get inside, and how to get to my door from the elevators. i also have it set for them to leave my order at the door. i’ve never had issues with anyone finding my door until this guy. 

he calls me saying he doesn’t know how to get inside because he went into our parking garage where you need a fob to enter the building (my instructions said to not park inside the garage but to park on the outside of the building where there are stalls). i explain that all of the information is in the delivery notes then he goes on to say that he doesn’t know how to see the delivery notes. i always make sure there are instructions because apartments can be confusing. when i looked at the drivers profile it said he’s done 65 deliveries so… there’s no way he wouldn’t know where to find delivery notes.

at this point he sounds very irritated and is just complaining. i even offered to come downstairs to the parking garage to grab the order but for some reason he kept refusing. after he parked on the outside it took like 15 minutes to get to my door. where he parked is right by the entrance and there’s also a map in front of each elevator in my building to show which way to go to get to which apartment. 

he gets to my door, and even though i put to just drop the food off he won’t leave until i come to the door. i ended up opening but i had my other roommates with me because i felt unsafe opening it by myself. i said ‘thank you’ and he didn’t say a single word to me, just looked annoyed. 

i want to leave a bad review but i’m concerned about two things 1. for my safety. do uber drivers see who leaves a bad review? he also has seen my face and knows where i live. in general i’m a paranoid person and am worried that’s if he’s angry enough about the bad review that he’ll do something. and 2. how badly do bad reviews affect delivery drivers? i don’t know if this is serious enough for him to potentially loose his job but i want to make sure i never get him as a delivery driver again. 

i’ve never given someone a thumbs down, but is this serious enough to give one? i’m also debating on taking away the tip but haven’t yet. am i overreacting or is it justified?",2025-04-16 01:03:20,5,12,Reddit,UberEats

"easy to fix peeves for the uber eats driver app 1. i've asked uber in feedback half a dozen times if they can add a mute button to the app that will mute all sound including notification.  all i need/want is the map and having notifications ding and interrupting music/postcast is annoying.

2. uber has a terrible and dangerous habit of sending the next order at the worst possible time when you're nearing your drop off location.  this is the most dangerous time to take the drivers eyes off the road since it is the point where you're most likely looking for final turns to get to the drop off location.  on several occastions when i'm looking back and forth to the map and the road, searching for the next turn the app decides to send a notifciation to pick up another order and then i'm simutanously trying to decline the request, drive safely and make sure i don't miss my turn.  they could even add a user configurable setting that allows for a no-send new orders buffer for <n> number of miles from the drop off.

3. very minor, but the pop up for ""are you looking for your customer"" is super annoying and overly aggressive.  no, i'm waiting for this damn screenshot to finish uploading.  they could at least give it a couple of minutes (or do away with it all together, because it's useless feedback.  i think we all know to contact the customer if we're having trouble finding the drop off)",2025-04-14 12:50:45,1,5,Reddit,UberEats

hoy reviso mi cuenta bancaria y veo que no me han reembolsado los más de 50 pavos del pedido. miro los recibos de uber eats y me dicen que no recibo reembolso porque el restaurante había empezado a preparar mi pedido. ¡¿disculpa?! ¡¿tres segundos después de haberlo confirmado, ya estaba todo empezado al punto de que perderían dinero o materia prima si lo cancelan y me hacen el reembolso?!

ahora estoy peleándome con uber eats, que dicen que no hay nada que puedan hacer, que el restaurante ya había empezado el pedido y por eso no tengo derecho a recibir un reembolso.

"can restaurants steal your tip to the delivery driver? the short answer is, yes.  and some do.  here's how they do it.  if you order through the restaurant's official app or website but an ubereats or doordash driver delivers your order then the manager at the store can send it out to whichever service they contract with without your tip included.

also, if you use ez cater, then the restaurant can do the same thing with the drivers they contract.

if you want to know if your delivery driver got your tip, simply ask, ""did you get my tip?"" you can tell them how much you tipped and ask to see if it matches what they were offered. once an order is marked as completed on doordash, the driver sees the full pay.  it's a little different on ue, the driver has to wait a little over an hour before the system reveals the final pay and sometimes ue will hide the full tip amount from the driver until then.",2025-04-14 00:13:07,1,5,Reddit,UberEats

i've already rated him poorly, but i'm very tempted to report him. maybe he ate it? maybe he's stalking us? maybe he just didn't wanna walk down the driveway?? i don't know what the heck that was. even if you just wanted the money, why drive all the way out here???

"getting mysterious food orders delivered to my house hi all,

for the past 4 nights in a row i've been receiving food delivered to my house but i didn't place any orders nor do i see any charges made on my account.

on the order receipt there's a customer name that i'm not familiar with and the order is always a single order of sausage and egg sandwich from a&w around 1-2am.

i spoke to my neighbors to see if it's theirs but all of them are claiming it's not theirs.

anyone have any similar incidents like this happen to them?

"im an uber eats driver and i just found out that my boyfriend does not tip on his uber eats orders. we were just getting home from an event which we took a taxi from since for whatever reason uber wasn’t working. he tipped the taxi driver which sparked up a conversation about tipping on uber and uber eats. he says that because he pays a delivery fee that he doesn’t feel the need to tip. i took out my phone to show him exactly how much uber actually pays without tip, and he refused to even look at it. after a brief back and forth he said “fine” and that he’s just not going to use the platform anymore and in which i responded “good, drivers don’t want people like you on the platform anyways”.

those were the last words we said to each other, i’m now laying in bed and he’s in the living room watching college volleyball. where do we go from here?

"food marked as delivered, wasn’t there, then showed up later.  should i eat it? 
so i ordered food on ubereats, and the app said it was delivered at a certain time—but when i went outside, there was nothing there. i checked a few more times, still nothing. tried contacting the driver, no response. figured it was a no-show, so i requested a refund, deleted the tip and ordered something else because i was starving.

then… when my second order was arriving an hour later, i open the door again and boom—my original order is just sitting there. i am 100% sure that it wasn’t there earlier, because it’s right on my mat. guess the driver either hit “delivered” before actually dropping it off or made a mistake and fixed it later without saying anything.

i recently started delivering with uber eats in london, ontario, using an electric bike. my first shift didn’t go too well. i began in an area that appeared busy on the map but didn't receive any orders for the first hour. then i moved to downtown and completed a couple of small deliveries.​

as i'm new to this, i'd appreciate any advice from experienced couriers. should i keep moving around to find orders, or is it better to stay in one spot? also, for those delivering in london, on, are there specific areas or times that tend to be more active?​

"restaurants/merchants beware!!! my husband and i recently opened a restaurant and we signed up with doordash and ubereats. doordash has been amazing. ubereats has been a nightmare. it’s currently going on three months and we still have yet to receive a payment from them. we’ve received weekly payments from doordash with no issue. we had to update our bank account once, and doordash walked us through the entire process. meanwhile, ubereats is forcing me to update my bank details despite them being accurate. i reached out them over a month ago to inquire about why we hadn’t been paid out. they sent me an email response advising me that a hold was being placed on my account while they investigated the issue. but they kept sending orders for us to fulfill. the “hold” is only on payments to us. so they expect me to continue to send out food and they not pay us for it. i’ve told them multiple times that my bank account details are correct, and i asked them to confirm if they actually attempted to pay us out. they never confirmed. they just continue to send the same canned response asking that i update my bank details. i’ve called in around 10x at this point, only to constantly be told that they can’t assist me, and only the merchant support team can assist me, but they’re only available via email. i’ve sent more emails that i can count, and they continue to send the same canned response. at this point i’m convinced that the “merchant support team” doesn’t exist, and this is ai that they’re using to respond to customers. it’s either that or it’s an offshore team that speaks zero english, and have pre written responses for them. i’ve asked to contacted by phone, i’ve asked multiple questions, and each time they respond with the same canned response. if i had the time right now i would sue ubereats. i would spend every dollar i have to sue them. it should be completely illegal for a company to withhold your funds and refuse to speak to you in any way. the fact that i’ve spoken with multiple ubereats reps over the phone and they’ve all looked at my case and apologized saying that they have no idea why this team isn’t responding is insane. i’ve removed my restaurant from their platform and i will never put it back.

"uber-eats is a rip-off when picking up groceries. sketchy pricing. i made a purchase through uber-eats for costco goods.  included in the purchase was a small appliance.  the uber price paid was $150.  then uber charged me $175 and said that the cost difference was the actual price in-store.  

the courier threw away my receipt.  if my small appliance doesn't work, how would i get a refund or exchange? i don't know if the purchase was made under my costco membership.  

$25 difference is excessive when all fees and taxes were already paid for to uber at $150.  the actual price before the fees and taxes was $131.

i was chatting with uber support and they kept telling me to contact the merchant.  uber would not provide any explanation for the receipt or the excessive difference in price.  if i knew the price difference, i would have had a choice to continue or not continue with purchase.

uber-eats should stick to delivering food from restaurants (receipts are stapled to the bag).  they are incredibly sketchy with grocery stores especially when receipts are not provided.  use another service for this.

"about discounts i wanna ask if anyone understands how to promo codes for uber work, everyone in my family recently have all been getting multiple use 40-50% off discounts on ubereats, while i haven't gotten any.

after about a week of pondering why, i surmised its because i am very active on ubereats and they only give codes to those who use the service infrequently, sort of as a way to entice inactive users to order more, but since i order a lot anyway, i don't get them, since they see i don't need to be enticed.

so the question is, are promo codes actually linked to inactivity? google says no, but i don't have any other explanation for why i'm the only one who doesn't get them, i get dozens of grocery promo codes, but i never order groceries from uber, which supports my hypothesis that codes are only given to inactive users.

if it is linked to inactivity, how long do i have to go without ordering to start getting these codes? does anyone know? if its nothing to do with inactivity, then why do i never get codes?",2025-04-11 20:15:18,1,3,Reddit,UberEats

background: i had an order on april 4 that was not delivered by the driver. i called that day and uber eats confirmed the driver delivered my order to another location and i was eligible for a refund. they tried to process the return and ran into a technical issue and could not. fast forward to today (april 9) and i have called customer support every day and every day they try to process the refund and say it's not working and there is a technical issue.

i'm in canada so not sure if this is a problem everywhere but the customer support folks that i have asked say that their tools are not working right now and it's not just me. they said a team is working on it but it's been a problem for at least six days that i've seen.

"i had an incredibly rude customer who spoke abusively to me yesterday. i immediately called uber and had her blocked, but i’m frustrated with uber’s overall response about the whole thing so here’s the story

breakfast order. drop off is in a sort of business park. multiple buildings.

drop off instructions are, “i’ll keep an eye on the gps and meet you outside the building”

first off, both uber maps and google maps were wrong. i got out of my car and nearly circled a large building looking for an entrance that had the correct address on it

across from this building is another building, and a lady is sitting on a curb outside of said building, deep in a phone call, paying absolutely zero mind to me. i walk past this person twice. i initially pulled up very obviously opening my trunk and got my order out of my car and was very obviously delivering an uber eats order while looking very serious about trying to figure out where i was going.

yes, of course this lady was my customer. it hadn’t occurred to me that she could be customer because for all i knew, she was hanging out at the wrong building. and she was waaay off from the building entrance to boot. her name was indian, i’m not familiar with indian names and it seemed more like a man’s name. my bad.

and honestly that she didn’t notice me obviously trying to deliver a food delivery, *her food deleivery* lmao, would normally be 100% forgivable by me. nbd.

well, my second sweep of the wrong building headed back to my car(this is all within 60 seconds) i message the customer, “i don’t see you” i pass her again and almost make it back to my car when she finally reveals herself.

she comes up from behind and asks if i’m delivering an uber eats order. “yes” and with attitude and reprimanding tone, she says sternly, “the building is over there” like i’m in trouble or something lol

i go, “gps is wrong for your building, it says it should be this building” again she says meanly, 
“the correct building is right here!”

pleading with her to understand, i ask “why are you giving me such a hard time??”

“i’m not the one giving a hard time” 🤦🏼‍♂️

again very rudely, “i was on a conference call!”

i hand her the order and go, “okay maam, you know what, you have a good day”

“you too” 🤦🏼‍♂️

i’ve done food delivery for 10 years, only been with uber for for .5 years, but i know how it is supposed to go. she absolutely should have been cool to me and not come down on me like a reprimanding authority figure.. so anyways..

aftermath

so i immediately call uber and block her and report her.

uber let her take the $2 tip off. okay, but didn’t you get me when i said she was being abusive?

and then later in the day i got a new thumbs down. did you not hear me say she was very abusive?? 

so today i decide to call uber to see if they can help me at least get that rating off. i finally get a hold of someone and i’m on hold and something happened when i was at the gas station, i don’t know if they hung up on me or i hung up on them, they never tried to call back. 

and now i just received an email about how to communicate better with customers 😂😂 this lady is a devil who came out swinging for no reason at all lmao. 99.9% of the time i never have a hard time communicating with customers, i communicate with people who only speak mandarin better than her… okay rant over

something tells me she’s not going to receive any negative action on her account whatsoever

makes me seriously want to get a body cam, which will probably make customers feel funny, but i kind of feel like i need it for my protection. like how many more times will this happen where uber takes the customer’s side?

*please be aware that such actions violate uber eats’ community guidelines and may result in the permanent deactivation of your account. we appreciate your cooperation in following these policies.*

ordered food from a restaurant, but suddenly i found out i ran out of soda at home, so on top of that restaurant order i added few cans of soda from nearby convenience store. that's all. (i think this is called a stack order or something)

"canceled the order 1 minute after submission. uber still took the money!! i ordered two pizzas and a salad through uber eats, and i’m extremely disappointed with the experience. uber has clearly **intentionally changed the checkout process** to hide the full total until *after* you pay.

just **seconds after i confirmed the order with apple pay**, the total came out to **$95**—far more than expected due to excessive hidden fees. i immediately canceled the order, not even a full minute later, but uber still charged me **$75**, claiming the restaurant had already started preparing the food.

that’s simply not true. the order was placed at **8:47 pm**, and the restaurant **closes at 9:00 pm**. there’s no way the kitchen began making the food in under a minute, especially that close to closing time.

uber’s practices here are **deceptive, misleading, and exploitative**. customers should be fully aware of what they're being charged *before* committing to a payment—not after. be cautious when ordering from uber eats, especially if you’re considering canceling due to their **astronomical hidden fees**.",2025-04-10 09:51:06,0,14,Reddit,UberEats
"drivers refusing to deliver coming here to rant about my frustrations from using this delivery service lol. okay so firstly, i work 12 hour shifts then when i get off i have about an hour before i have to clock in for my wfh job. with that being said i will often place an order before i shower so i can shower and eat before working... well this week i had a driver basically refuse to deliver my food because i couldn't come to her car and get it. it's important to note that i specifically requested leave at my door because some times my shift has started before the food comes. that is exactly what happened, my shift had started and i was on a call for about 10 minutes when i get a message on the uber eats app saying ""come to my car and get the food, i have a child in the car.""
now, i know i have to have empathy for mothers trying to provide for their children but obviously i was working trying to provide too. i don't know if anyone has had a wfh job before but any background noise can get you fired. if i walked outside and my neighbors were talking in the background i could have lost my job. i understand affording child care is hard but i don't understand accepting a ""leave at the door"" order knowing you're incapable of delivering it. to make it worse uber eats will not give me a refund or credits because the order was marked ""delivered."" however, there was no picture provided and in the delivery notes she literally put ""could not deliver order."" 
 i seen a post about a similar situation and all the comments were calling the op fat and saying they probably smell and they were lazy. i came on here to share my experience because some people have actual reasons they ask for orders to be left at their door ! not to mention if someone is disabled and can't walk to a delivery drivers car.  i don't understand why become a delivery driver if you can't deliver. i know i'm out of touch. but i didn't want to lose my job over a protein bowl. that was $20 vs my entire source of income. i guess i have to take an l because i didn't get a refund either lol 








edit / update:  

i reached out to customer service about 3 more times to which they told me they couldn't help me because it had been over 48 hours. so, i made a bbb complaint and uber responded saying that they responded to me in the app. i opened my app and there was a message saying my issues was ""already resolved"" i guess referring to the first email i got stating i am not eligible for a refund because the driver marked it delivered. 


i reached out to my bank and they told me the transaction isn't eligible for a refund. overall a frustrating experience all together. thanks for the helpful comments

food disappears and locating customer service is like walking on a bed of nails and 80% you get nowhere. 

it's just never worth it, getting food from that app. you can find what ur looking for anywhere else. the only thing they never fail in doing is taking their month 10 euro for ubereats plus which has to be the most non rewarding thing like to ever exist. haven't ordered there in months, and after my sister never got her food delivered due to an incompetent driver and got no help from ubereats, advised her to delete her account and the app too.

she was so nice.  smiled in my face and we were making good small talk as i was waiting for the app to process the id for the liqour.   that’s what is messed up.  it bothers me more that someone can be a snake like that to your face and totally screw you over. 

she can choke and die.  ppl can be so effed up.  8 dollars for 50 mins of two restaurants and drive.  i practically paid her to deliver.  

anyway, i asked uber if they do anything to ppl who tip bait and they said they send them to a specialized team to looks into their activity and then they email them and let them know they can’t do that, or they’ll lose the ability to order food.  but they said that only happens unless a driver reports them.  

so if that happens to you be sure to tell uber you’ve been tip baited, you also have the right to have them blocked to get them as a customer.

"f! mcds mcdonald's breakfast hours run from 4:00 a.m. to 10:30 a.m. at every restaurant in the united states. that means lunch items cannot be ordered between 4:00 a.m. and 10:30 a.m.

the uber eats website allows ordering of mcdonald's lunch items until 4:01 a.m. that means any order that is placed between the hours of 3:45 a.m. and 4:01 a.m. for lunch items will be impossible to fulfill or deliver. 

over the past month, i have had a minimum of 25 of these orders that i had to cancel on arrival at mcdonald's. i have explained the situation calmly to uber eats support multiple times but it still is not fixed. 

just now, 15 minutes ago, at 3:35 a.m. i received a mcdonald's offer and proceeded to mcdonald's, arriving at 3:38 a.m. because i was within less than a mile. when i arrived, the order was for multiple lunch items but their drive-thru menu was on breakfast. 

apparently, mcdonald's in this area has decided that 3:00 a.m. is now the lunch, cutoff time and breakfast will go from 3:00 a.m. to 11:00 a.m.

this makes pick up and delivery of breakfast items after 10:30 a.m. or lunch items before 3:00 a.m. impossible. and it's going to take another month or two before the uber eats website reflects this, meaning many drivers who work early morning shifts or overnight shifts will experience what i went through today. 

at this point, any orders for mcdonald's that we receive between the hours of 2:30 a.m. and 4:00 a.m. should be ignored. and any customers who choose to order lunch before 4:00 a.m. should expect to be canceled.",2025-04-10 04:51:23,1,8,Reddit,UberEats

"took my money hey everyone, this is the first time this has happened to me with uber eats, i ordered my food to be delivered contactless. i received the notification that my food was delivered but it was not outside my apartment door. i checked the photo and the person who was delivering my food delivered it to the wrong apartment but i couldn't tell from the photo which apartment it was delivered too. 

i contacted uber eats right away and they refused to refund me! they told me that the driver was at the right location and he delivered the food and there's nothing they can do about it. i got so mad at the customer representative, i told her to prove to me that the food was delivered to my house and she again responded that it shows in her system the food was delivered to the right location. they were blaming me for their driver's fault. the driver did not contact me either. after speaking with the supervisor i got the same response and got nowhere. in short they kept all my money.

isn't this illegal? how are they able to keep our money?

i felt hopeless so my last option was contacting my credit card company and they were extremely helpful, they took the charge off my balance and they told me that they'll contact uber eats on their end. please contact your payment method company right away if you are ever in this situation. i'm done using uber eats!",2025-04-09 07:27:58,5,4,Reddit,UberEats

"policy changes that encourage poor service i've been driving for ubereats for more than 3 years now. several months ago, ubereats changed it's policy about order cancellations on the driver's end. it used to be a driver wasn't penalized for a restaurant system error, ubereats system error, order stolen by someone else or excessive wait time at the restaurant.  now, any cancellation by the driver is a cancellation penalty on his account.  too many of those leads to deactivation.

if you notice your driver telling you to cancel your own order over problems then that may be the reason why.  i used to be able to contact support and get all sorts of things done for my customers.

**the process was:**

1. contact support, tell them about the issue.
2. support contacts the restaurant or the customer to verify.
3. issue resolved with no money coming from the customer's pocket. and a $3 payout for the driver for handling the issue.

**now:**

1. contact support, tell them about the issue.
2. no matter what, driver gets a ding on his account for order cancellation.

they won't even reach out to the customer or restaurant anymore.

restaurant's ue system not working but ubereats sends me there to pick up an order they don't have. i got penalized. contacting support didn't matter.

system glitch sends out walmart pickup orders after the delivery pickup section has closed. didn't realize it until after i had accepted 2 for a stack.  got two cancellation penalties.

went to pick up a pizza order to be told i was the 4th driver sent out and the restaurant is not remaking the order. i got penalized for cancelling because the first driver stole the pizzas. contacting support didn't matter.

customer puts the wrong address on the delivery. contacts the driver after the driver accepts the order. the new delivery address is far out of the way.  driver gets penalized if he doesn't deliver it.

all of those scenarios used to be handled by a call or text chat with support.  no penalties to the driver.  now, the driver is penalized 100% of the time. the last situation happened to me about a month ago, i asked the customer to cancel; he had ordered over $100 worth of liquor and i hadn't picked it up yet. he told me, if he canceled it, uber was going to refund him only $8 of his order and he promised me a larger tip. i contacted support and got someone who clearly had no authority to do anything. i trusted the customer and delivered the order. he did keep his word and tipped me well.  the original destination was only 4 miles away but the new destination was about 12 miles away out in the rurals.

for the ue customers, if driver after driver are being sent to pick up your order; it was probably stolen by the first driver. with the policy changes, no driver has any incentive to contact support to resolve the issue for you. he will simply cancel his delivery and move on and the system will keep sending out drivers until (after) business closing hours.  the driver will get penalized regardless of what he does. and if you cancel, uber will use that as an opportunity to keep some/most of your money for that order.

this is the worst customer and driver service out of doordash, grubhub and ubereats.  it is absolutely shameful!",2025-04-09 03:13:01,7,5,Reddit,UberEats

"got an 1.77 add on for 6 miles away. it would have been 12 miles for me as it was my last order of the day and i would have to backtrack. 

the only reason i accepted the order is because it was the same pickup location as the other and the drop off was along the route to the other drop off. 

but for some reason the app had me do the other drop off first and expected me to drive to the other location after even though i drove right by it on the way.

so i contacted support and the canceled the order for me. but right before they did i sent the customer a message letting them know i'm canceling due to low pay and too far for me to go. 

they responded almost instantly with "" bro what"".
and then "" you better bring me my damn order""

was fun as hell seeing a cheapskate non tip customer get upset knowing they couldn't downvote me for it. 

people seriously expect delivery drivers to do this for free.

i had another no tip order earlier today and the person was too embarrassed to answer the door (pin required) and had thier kid get it. i could hear them talking. 

if tipping a couple dollars is too outlandish for you perhaps consider getting your food yourself. ",2025-04-09 01:20:13,8,1,Reddit,UberEats

i live alone and have 1500 in bills including rent to pay monthly. 

should i go for uber eats? and doordash etc?

dominos is solid if you are a full time closer or can work like 4-5 rush shifts including weekends, but i am not getting those hours despite working there for 2 years now (and i’ve done pizza delivery for over 10 years). my new gm is a b word. 

i’m very close to quitting at dominos, i don’t want to, but the scheduling is insulting

what do you guys think about keeping my dogwater schedule at dominos, but do gig work on one or two of my days off? 

i wanna stay at dominos, and may be able to get 3 shifts. two closes and 1 rush…maybe more, but that’s a big “if” and includes closing with two horrible managers, one of which i hate with all my heart.

. alright, 2 days later, nothing sunday now a week later, i finally get a reply. but it's not to reply to the order. i have. it was replayed to an order to. it was already dealt with a month ago, so i decide. d oh, you know what i'm gonna give uber eats a call, grab my roommate cell phone, call them. because mine's still blocked and hey, lo and behold, i'm being told sorry, sir. 

the courier couldn't deliver it. we see that you've been charged. we see that the vendor has been paid, we see that but as far as you're concerned, you get nothing

. excuse me, nope, sorry. the vendor's already been paid back. okay, so where's my return? nope, we don't. play we are not getting anything back so you've taken a $148 out of my money provided no service

. the carrier has provided no service. the vendor has provided no service that you are hired to do for me. and now i get charged for it and don't get it. that's called theft. yep, sorry, bye and hang's up. and i called back again, they block that number down. i grab my other roommate's number phone call there.

 i've got a beautiful lady very quiet, very polite, very attentive to the need. she escalates it up. well, i get a call back probably not. will i ever see that money again? probably not we'll ever use your app again,

"are restaurants not allowed to contact the customer or sub items anymore? wondering this because a few years ago, if an item was not in stock after ordering, uber would have a pop-up saying ""xxx is not available, you have xx minutes to replace it or remove it"" or just cancel the item and refund it, but make everything else. last 2 or 3 times though, no communication whatsoever. i had 2 shitty experiences and 1 pleasant one:

1st time: i get all the way there for pick up on new year's eve and bro was like ""we do not have chicken, beef, or lamb. i can make you fish"". we do not want fish. you could have called before i arrived. everything is slammed tonight and now i have to either stay here while you cook fish or go elsewhere. bro also told me to cancel. lol

2nd time: 10/10 restaurant did not have an item and sent a handwritten note in the order stating they did not have it, and gave us 3 extra of another item we had ordered. (i could see this going wrong for another customer though, who might have really wanted the item)

"ubereats? never again! hello! 
i'm not sure if it's the right place to share my story, i'm so frustrated!!!


yesterday, i ordered from ubereats and canceled the order within less than 10 minutes (the restaurant didn't even start preparing my order!)

after canceling my order i got an email saying my order is canceled (no any fees mentioned) i thought that's it, i'm going to get my money back (around $124) and specially after canceling it with less than 10 minutes, plus no any alerts/messages mentioning that i will not get any refund after canceling my order and there will be a cancelation fee, which i'm fine with its my fault placing the order without paying enough attention (it shouldn't be this complicated though! but fine mistakes happens), also the fee shouldn't be the full amount!!

i woke up after midnight checked my phone, and got shocked by a email sent to me around 1:21am! saying my afternoon receipt from (the restaurant name and ubereats) and it's the cancelation fee which is the full amount ( order total amount) definitely i couldn't sleep after getting the bad news.

i tried contacting them through live chat with no any help and leaving the chat while i'm still not done texting saying that they can't help any further and they can't do anything about it, it's my fault again because i canceled my order before getting back to them and for next time i have to let them know before canceling my order so they can help me (which will never happen again!) 

it's not okay and that's stealing money from my own pocket somehow in a way or another, at least that's how i see it. 
i pay to get a service and they took my money for nothing and not even offering anything back to make you feel better. 
i'm not new to them and i was a member.

i talked to them asked them to disable my account and i will make sure to tell this to each and every single person i meet.

"so i witnessed the wildest robbery in gig work ever, and i'm a lyft driver. i placed an order for chinese food through the uber eats app. i had $23 in credits from a prior bad experience, so i decided i'd send my fiance to the restaurant as an uber eats driver to pick up our order. the order total came out to around $62 and the restaurant wasn't far, so it made for some good data collecting. i set up my entrance, parking, and delivery pins to see how accurate these things would be for a driver, and figured we would be getting a decent chunk of the money back since the total was so large. by decent, i was expecting between $10 to $15. of course i didn't leave a tip, at that point it'd be practically money laundering lol. 

the order paid $2. it came up as $2 before she accepted it, but i thought surely they're just hiding the total pay like doordash. she said they weren't, but i held out hope until she ""delivered"" the order and confirmed that out of $62 and change, uber eats felt she should get $2. miles be damned, where did the rest of the money go? i normally order direct from this restaurant and i know the order was about $15 higher from the delivery app, but with my free trial of uber one i didn't pay a delivery fee. i haven't edited the pictures yet but if anyone needs them, i'll make a new post.",2025-04-05 20:29:28,0,13,Reddit,UberEats

i placed the order and waited about 20 minutes before checking the app. nothing had moved. my first driver (on a bike) was just stopped at some random spot near the mcdonald’s not even trying to pick up the food.

then i got a notification: that a new driver was assigned this time in a car. they drove to the mcdonald’s and i thought, alright, cool. probably just a glitch or issue with the first one.

nope.

i check again and suddenly i have a *third* driver. still no food picked up. then, out of nowhere… *driver number four* appears. at this point i’m just watching this unfold like it’s a tv show.

and then… they *canceled* my order.

"tip hello,

i just wanted some clarification. i left a good tip yesterday. i’m not the type to not leave tip unless you treat me like crap. but i notice another order got added. the reason why i left a big tip was so that i could get my food fast because i was at the restaurant earlier but had to leave because i had a panic attack in my car. that’s besides the point but i went home and ordered from the restaurant again. 
i got an estimated time for delivery. but when i checked the map the driver had turned back and went to go pick up another order. my delivery time increased by 30 minutes.
today i got a notification that said i could change my tip (i didn’t because i had already committed and i know it would f up to change it.) 
moving forward are there any tricks to getting my delivery orders faster without extra orders being added. was it my drivers choice to add it? are you obligated to add more trips? 
should i change my mind set and be more flexible with trips being added? just want some clarification from you all because it’s your job and i am also not trying to get in the way of you making more money.

the same damn item is worth $9.99 in person (didn't notice till i for there since i did pick up). the store really inflated the price so if you buy the bogo deal it comes to the same amount as buying two orders in person which is $9.99 \* 2 = $19.98, since i live in canada the tax is 13% so thats $19.98 \* 13% = $22.5774

now i understand if they don’t believe me that the chicken nuggets weren’t in the bag, because it’s my word against the restaurants (even though i had countless orders with them and rarely complain about missing items). the fries on the other hand, which were $5.99, was not on the physical receipt but was on my online receipt. even though i pointed this out, i got what i felt like was an automated response, saying that “they reviewed the claim and found no errors in the order”. 

????????????

i tried to argue with them but they kept saying the same message. i don’t want to do a chargeback because then i’ll get banned. is there anything i can do? or did ubereats just steal $5.99 from me? ",2025-04-04 19:15:36,1,4,Reddit,UberEats
"i had uberone for the last 2 months and i paused it, i noticed delivery fees for even close distance restaurants have gone up now. anyone else have similar experience? had uber one for the past couple months, i felt like it didn't make that big of difference since i mostly order from close restaurants anyway. besides having 0 dollar delivery fee on some restaurants, i felt like it didn't do much such daily offers still exist even if i don't have an uber one membership. 

from what i remember 3 months ago, almost all the restaurants near me including big chains were about 3-4 dollars at most for places  under 5 miles in distance. a bunch of the restaurants under 2 miles had 99 cent delivery fees, 1.99 at most.

now there's restaurants under 2 miles that cost at least 3.50, close to 4 dollars just for the delivery fee.

"my $26 ubereats order turned into a multi-day quest to prove that black doors aren’t white so i think we can all agree that uber eats customer service is powered by hamsters with anxiety disorders, but buckle up because i’ve got a story that’ll make you cancel your subscription and take up hamster hunting.

it all started on april 1^(st) – which should’ve been my first clue. i ordered food like any civilized adult who refuses to cook. uber eats, in their infinite wisdom, delivered it *not to me*, but to the building across the street. close, but not quite. like throwing a dart and hitting the wall *next* to the dartboard.

so i call the delivery guy (yes, i recorded it like a true karen in training). he realizes the oopsie and promises to either bring the food to the right place or tell uber what happened so we could all move on with our lives. i said cool, no problem.

**spoiler alert: he did not bring the food.**

maybe he couldn’t get back into the building, maybe a raccoon ate it. i don’t know. so i go to uber support and send them all the receipts:

\- a screenshot of the uber map with the pin *not even on my building*

\- a photo the guy took of a white door (??? not mine)

\- a photo from a past delivery of *my* actual door (black, sleek, mysterious)

ranjeet from support says, “no worries, we’ll look into it and reply in 6-12 hours.” i nod as ranjeet gives me hope.

**april 2nd.** i get an email saying, and i quote:

“i have reviewed your order and wasn’t able to confirm that your order did not arrive.”

which, in customer service lingo, translates to: “we didn’t look but you can’t prove it.” so i re-enter the rings of fire which is uber support.

this time i get a guy called slurpdeep. i try to explain that no, the review did not actually happen – because unless we live in a dimension where white = black and ""other building"" = ""my condo,"" they would’ve seen the issue. slurpdeep decides he’s had enough logic for the day and ends the chat.

i summon a new agent. enter: harsh. fittingly, harsh ends the convo before i even say anything. just rage-quit the customer service interaction like i’d offended his ancestors, perhaps he was sitting beside slurpdeep.

then, the legend himself returns – or maybe it’s another ranjeet, who knows – and says the same thing: wait 6-12 hours.

**april 3rd.** déjà vu. uber tells me again: “we cannot confirm your food didn't arrive.” i re-enter the chat trenches. 6-12 hours. again. i’m aging in real time.

**april 4th.** the sun is shining. birds are singing. my faith in humanity? gone. i connect with a new agent named james. i tell him i’ve been trying to fix this for 3 days. james tells me it’s been *more than 48 hours* so they *can’t do anything now*. i tell him the reason it’s been more than 48 hours is *because uber support kept telling me to wait 6-12 hours*. james says “cool story” and hits me with a chat disconnect.

at this point, i try to ask any agent – anyone – if i can just talk to a human being on the phone. crickets. total ghosting. so i take matters into my own hands.

now, uber eats doesn’t have a phone support option because why would they. but uber rides does… for “emergencies.” and listen. my $26 was on the line and my stomach was on strike. this was a michael scarn classic; threat level midnight.

i call the uber emergency line. a nice lady picks up and asks, “sir, are you injured?”

i say, “not physically. but my brain cells are hanging on by a thread.” she transfers me to uber eats support. which *exists*, apparently. like narnia, but with less magic and more incompetence.

i explain the saga. the guy listens, then hits me with:

“according to our files, this has already been resolved.”

i politely ask him to just… look. at. the. map. the pin. the door photos. the facts.

after 15 minutes, he chuckles and says:

“yeah… i think i see the problem. the food was delivered to the wrong address.”

me: oh my god thank you. finally! sanity! recognition! redemption! my lord and saviour had arrived.

and just as i’m about to write a thank-you note to this beautiful man and name my future child after him, he says:

“sir, you’ll have to wait 6–12 hours for a decision.”

so, dear reader. after 4 days, 7+ support chats, 1 emergency call, two ranjeets, one slurpdeep, and a man named harsh who ghosted me like a bad tinder date, i’m still waiting. for $26. and for closure.

but mostly for the food that never came.",2025-04-04 16:10:25,11,7,Reddit,UberEats

it’s a recurring thing that one or two items disappear from my order half the time. unfortunately i’m disabled and pretty much dependent on this delivery service for groceries. it’s so annoying to have to argue over this crap and get nowhere. 

and this thing where they just disconnect your chat?  whoever came up with that had no customer service background because that just pisses people off. 

i know eventually they’ll probably adjust it off but i’m getting to a point where i’m either going to video my unbagging everything or make the driver stay until i go through the whole order. 😂

"ue from the perspective of a driver and a customer for 1+ years. hi, i do ue on the side 4 hours max on a busy weekend, and i have been driving for a year and used it for 2 years, here are the takes:

1. accept that your order will be late, cold, stolen, or even messed up if you didn’t count a good tip for a distance covered; i don’t care about non tippers since i already decline any order less than $2 for a mile at least and lots of drivers do the same to make actual money counting gas, and time. so when you don’t tip according to your distance (you may have tipped $10 but the distance between you and the restaurant is 15mil and uber pays $2 flat so it may all come out as $12-$14.75) and in that case most of the professional drivers that you will want to get your food won’t accept and either you will end up waiting until uber pumps up their fare so a decent driver gets it or you will get a bad driver that probably will ruin your experience. also ubers hates to pay more for your food to be delivered and then will start to pair you with bad drivers since you are a bad tipper eventually for you to get off the app and stop making them lose money.

2. “don’t work for them if you are not paid, tipping is optional!”, yes it is, and also is delivery and getting the service you desire, we also need to make money and count our way back and forth so a $150 order for $2 won’t cut it regardless of who and what you ordered and your order will be in a dishonest drivers belly by the time uber pumps up their fare.

3. it is actually a good profitable side gig especially for people between jobs which a lot right now are and you may become one, so don’t be harsh on others, and since people like me love to do it for decent people who know how to value their service providers, i have no problem to deliver an order that uber bumps up its fare good enough to be worth it (probably stolen and remade, or cold from sitting with no takers).

3. i do calculate and tip my drivers at least $2 a mile, and if i am gonna order it is too far i just go and pick it up myself to get the full experience.

4. ue and dd has tons of lawsuits regarding their evil pay but even if they paid good, you will be the one who pays anyways since you are the customer, don’t expect people to pay for your food! and you don’t want them to have good pay or you will even pay more than what you can tip to compensate your driver.

5. (for drivers) if you live in a good place with decent people who can afford tip and delivery, this will be fantastic for you, if not, you need to find another way next to it to get your bills paid and only do it on busy times and cherry pick the good ones until the crappy ones are bumped up.

6. it is not actually an “easy gig”, to treat the food as your own and don’t ruin your experience in the process, keeping it whole through the cold/hot weather and idiot drivers on the road, especially drunk ones on a saturday evening, you are not god or any special, we do it because we get paid to, and pros will not want to ruin someone’s experience and waste their time anyways, basically, good pay = hot perfect food delivery + good service.

7. unfortunately this will not always happen, even if you tipped really good and took the priority option, uber is still an evil corporation and may pair you with bad drivers that will ruin your experience.

that is what i learned so far and hope to see your comments about new things that i should learn.

"rant - worst customer service ever i'm so mad at these money sucking scum bags. 

i say this because if a restaurant makes a mistake, they fix it. if a driver makes a mistake, they fix it. when their application bugs, it's apparently the customers fault. despite all good logic, loyalty and dollars spent over the years, they still blame me.

bumped into a friend on the street and we decided to get boustan for lunch. i told her they have a great 2 for 1deal, that i order quite regularly. we needed to order through uber to benefit from the deal. 

when i opened the app, there were things in my cart, so i deleted them and we placed our order together. 

when the food was ready, we only had one meal, with extras that we never ordered. the restaurant told us to contact uber, so that's what i did. 

customer service chat just kept repeating that it was my mistake. i forgot to select two plates, for the 2/1. 

1. when you select the plate, it automatically puts two. 

2. why did i get extras that i never even ordered?  they were deleted from my cart, when i approved the order.

3. considering my order history, having ordered this same deal at least 3x a month, wouldn't you consider that the mistake wasn't actually mine?

in my recent order history, i have nine of these ordered. only the last one was incorrect. 

i tried another agent through facebook. same story. they won't acknowledge that i received extras that weren't in my order when i approved it. they also repeated that i need to select two for the deal. remember that when you select one, it automatically adds a second one. so if i proceed as directed, i'll end up with four meals. 

people make mistakes. it happens. if my friend wasn't there placing the order with me, i might have questioned it. since we decided together what to eat together, she was looking at the app along with me. in fact she's the one who noticed the extras that we never ordered. 

i really mad at the service, or lack of customer service. angry that they defy logic and blame me, since they feel the receipt for the order received, not the order i processed is proof enough. 

what about logic? who would order only one meal when the second is free? i would have to manually delete a plate for that to happen. 

once, about 4 years ago, a restaurant forgot to put something in my bag. it took two seconds to get a refund. i've seen countless stories of restaurants and drivers getting screwed over by dishonest people.  uber always gives the customer their way, when it's not coming from their pockets.

i've worked in customer service forever.  i know the scams. i know people can sometimes make ridiculous demands. hard to believe that the application could make such a mistake, but it did. 

now that i know how much uber values my business, i'll go elsewhere.

i'm furious and this is my rant. f-u uber. i will order from another app in the future. shame on you for fixing everyone else's mistakes, but your own.

"anyone know if merchant partners have delivery priority? i ordered a very tasty doner kebab the other night, although it was pretty cold as the driver just hung around for ages and then seemingly went around in circles for a while after that.

to my surprise, the kebab company has its own website with delivery service - so the next day i ordered from there. but then to my further surprise, it turns out they use uber eats to deliver! but the funny thing was, the delivery came much quicker.

so i'm just wondering if anyone actually knows this - do merchant partners who use uber eats to deliver their own orders taken from their own websites - have some sort of delivery priority?",2025-04-03 10:50:28,1,1,Reddit,UberEats

i signed up for uber to use an ebike, and now it's saying that it's not available to use in my area (i live in a smaller town). whatever. doesn't really matter because i planned on doing deliveries in a town about 30 mins away from me that does allow ebikes. 

i googled it, and it tells me something about having to manually change cities, and provide ""extra supporting documentation"". 

is that really needed? i'm new to uber, haven't even done a delivery yet so i gotta ask, do any of you do deliveries in different cities? will there be any restrictions if i travel? i'd hate to ride all the way there to be shut down like that. ",2025-04-03 08:04:44,1,1,Reddit,UberEats

"is ubereats baiting and switching their drivers? i've been driving for a couple years and have learned to be very picky with accepting orders in order to maintain a decent per hour wage.  my acceptance rate is pretty low.

the other night i got an offer that was like $45.00 for 2 deliveries taking about an hour and an acceptable number of miles so i accepted.  on my way to the first restaurant i got a notification that one of the orders was canceled.  now i have no way of seeing the miles/hours/pay remaining.  i completed the remaining order and then could see that the one that got canceled was much more profitable than the one that remained.  so i made about $17 and lost $28.  not happy about that.

but then it happened again!  got a juicy offer, accepted it, and then 1 of 2 orders gets canceled!  and of course it was the juicy one that canceled.  now i'm thinking ubereats is just trying to get me to accept orders that i normally wouldn't accept and are baiting me with false, high-paying orders that get immediately canceled after you accept the 2 together.

"courier stole my order, ubereats refuse to refund we ordered from a nearby burger place as were pretty tired from the day. we're frequent ubereats customers so this is pretty much business as usual.

we noticed an hour has passed and no delivery yet. we check the app and it says the order has been delivered.

we have had no calls from the courier. no doorbell ring. no in message app, absolutely no attempt at contacting us.

obviously we're starving at this point and couldnt reach the courier at this stage (as the order is completed), so we decided to just go to the restaurant which was a 15 minute walk from where we were.

the restaurant remembered our order and was sympathetic, we know its not their fault about the order, but its clear that the courier stole the food as they also made no attempt to return the food back to the restaurant, we know this as i spoke to the manager on the same evening. he was even nice enough to give us a free dessert as he was sympathetic.

its been more than a week and ubereats is dragging their feet in coming to a resolution, does anyone have escalation recommendations here? i have a stellar rating as a customer and im currently €80 out of pocket.

"complaint to raisr ltd parent company to uber inc as the parent company of uber inc i am notifying you, as contractee, of breach of contract with contractor (both myself - and the entirety of other contracted drivers).

uber has programmed ""the app"" with an algorithm to miscalculate ""driver cancellation"" and thus ""cancellation rate"" and thus taking punitive action against drivers who have fulfilled their end of the contract in good faith.

the only contractual language declaring and defining driver cancellation is:""your cancellation rate is the percentage of trip requests (rides and/or deliveries) that you cancel divided by the total trip requests you accept. this includes canceling a trip radar request after you accepted it.”

contrary to this uber programmed the app to treat any/all undelivered - indeed even undeliverable - orders as driver cancelation and thus has unfairly and unjustly - in violation of the contract - taken punitive action against drivers who, for example in good faith drive to the pick up location and upon arrival discover, what uber should have known and prevented such order to be accepted by them much less made an offer to a driver with said order.

due to no fault of their own, in a context in which the driver has no control or ability to avoid. drivers are being demoted in status/llevel and thus being denied privileged orders, indeed also higher levels of support (if you can call a call center reading/cutting and pasting pre-scripted paragraphs pulled up by the call center operator by the use of keywords. uber does not and cannot anticipate, nor does it desire  to do so, every problem a driver faces in advance. this results in drivers' loss of earnings and earning potential. further, also with conscious intent, uber actually establishes and uses so called ""support"" call centers to establish a firewall between contractee and contractor - such that drivers are unable to communicate with the contractee - including in matters of this nature.  so drivers are sent by uber to pick up from a store that only upon arrival do they discover is closed (and often has been for hours), a store who informs the driver that they do not have the item in stock, a store who informs the driver that they are the third driver that arrived contractually (the same contract given to multiple drivers - so that the first picks up and then there is nothing to pick up by the  two subsequent drivers.), etc.  these orders are impossible for the driver to pick up much less deliver.  the driver, who in good faith complied with their end of the contract is thereby punished for something out of their control, and the fault of uber for offering contracts that are impossible for. any driver, under any circumstances, to deliver. the diver is not only compensated for their loss of earnings on the delivery, and earning potential because they can't accept a different, valid contract, while having expended time, effort, gas, mileage, and vehicle wear and tare - but adding insult to injury to injury uber takes punitive action against them - with no recourse to address the issue (this is formally being submitted to as a grievance by a contractor to the contractee - and i am more than willing to find an amicable resolution to this matter, but uber has taken conscious efforts to ensure that contractee can only communicate with a third party call center).

i can provide a more detailed statement if you need such.  and i can provide ample evidence to support my allegations and claims.

i look forward to your providing a timely response to this attempt to resolve this matter amicably and for a speedy rectification of the wrongs done by uber to ""it's"" drivers.",2025-03-31 16:49:23,2,2,Reddit,UberEats

i tried changing the address, but the system wouldn’t let me. i also tried canceling the order, but was told i’d still be charged. despite leaving a note not to pick it up, a driver took the order. when i messaged them, they said my actual address was too far. i then received a notification the the order was completed with a picture showing it just left outside some random business, perishables included.

i chatted with two customer service reps and got conflicting answers. one said no refund was possible, another promised one but then backtracked. today, i called, and the rep i spoke to again said no refund was possible. i called again and, finally, the fourth rep refunded my order.

she had multiple screaming kids in the car and i can barely hear her. she says she can’t read the apartment numbers. finally i just go outside and there she is just sitting there 50 feet from my unit with all these screaming kids in the car. i just take my order from the car window and that’s that.

i just wonder how much longer would she have just sat there if i didn’t call. i swear some people should not be delivering orders. the 88% rating should have tipped me off.

"tip for newer drivers/customers: be careful about picking up or placing orders from locations that are closed/about to close. hey all. i decided to do a psa post (which is also somewhat of a vent) to try to pass along some informative content to less experienced couriers and customers as well.

in my location/market, i sometimes do pickups late/very late at night. there are a handful of locations that, for whatever reason, consistently show up with pickup offers after they're closed or when they're going to be closed by the time i get there. these offers typically have unusually high pay amounts ($5-$10 per mile) and look like tasty (but unfulfilling) bait for unaware drivers. 

i'm not 100% sure on the mechanics, but i believe that the offer pay bloats up due to other drivers getting to the location and realizing it's closed. they end up using the automated menu/ai support bot to unassign them from the delivery (causing it to be reassigned to someone else, this time with higher pay), rather than talking to a live uber support person who can completely wipe the order from the system. additionally, it may stem from experienced drivers declining the offer after realizing the location is closed, which causes it to be reassigned again and again, with the pay eventually bloating up to a much larger number.

so, when doing late-night deliveries, following these tips may save you a lot of time and headache in the future.

tip 1: **always** treat unusually high pay-to-mileage ratios with a healthy dose of skepticism. honestly, this can apply no matter what time of the day it is. there may be other factors at play, such as the store closing/being closed, the location being short-staffed, etc. 

tip 2: if you're out at night and you see a suspiciously high pay, try to look up the location quickly (before the offer goes away) on your maps app to see what their hours are. if the location is closing soon, it's best not to take the offer.

tip 3: if you do take the offer and you then find the location is closed, you have a few options: one, try to see if the customer is able to cancel it (this may be unlikely to work out because in the majority of cases, the customer can not or will not receive a refund for canceled orders once they're started). two, contact uber support and inform them that the location is closed. support may give you a hard time about it (as they have done with me in the past), but it's not your fault the app assigned you an order to a location that's closed. do not use the 'report issue' -> 'store is closed' option from the menu, or talk to the ai support about the location being closed, as this will cause the order to simply be unassigned from you and reassigned to someone else. ask for 'agent', and when the ai bot asks you to give more details, just say 'agent please' and you'll be connected.

tip 4: this is an extra tip that i'm **not sure** will work in all cases, but it's worth a shot in instances where you're saddled with a multi-pickup and one of the locations is closed/has some other issue involved. when you're at the closed location, contact uber support and let them know the location you're at is closed and that you cannot complete that person's delivery. they will ask if you want them to unassign the delivery so that you can continue. tell them yes, but to not cancel the other order(s) involved (especially if it's an order you picked up already!). they will do so, and you can continue on delivering the order that you can complete. when you finish, you may receive half of what the canceled order's total pay amount was, which in some cases can be an incredible boon to your daily total, especially when you didn't even do that order. 

as a tip 4 example, i once headed to do a double pickup from a taco bell with a $61 pay offer attached to a 7-mile trip. i thought the location was closed but, to my surprise, it was not. the employee informed me they were able to complete customer 1's order, but that they ""didn't have the ingredients to make any of the items for customer 2's order."" i **doubt** that was the case, but whatever. i contacted customer 2 to let them know what happened (they were rightly upset about it, saying they had waited over an hour for their order to be made, which leads me to further doubt the tb employee), and then contacted support to have the delivery unassigned. because i already had customer 1's order in hand, i asked them to just cancel customer 2's order so i could complete the other one. they did so, i went and delivered it, and once completed, i received $35 immediately for the offer, and that was before customer 1's tip was processed. the final total was $43, again, for a 7-mile trip. *huge* win, but again, don't expect that this will always be the case. if anything, i think i just got very, *very* lucky.

that said, customers should also be wary of ordering from locations that are closing soon. the best advice i can give to customers is to **watch your order every step of the way**. don't just place an order and then go do something else, **keep an eye on it.** if it's taking too long to complete or even get started, try to contact support or the restaurant to see what can be done. also make sure you know where your driver is/is going after it's picked up. there's *so* much potential for scamming and bad practices from everyone involved: the restaurants, the drivers, and the customers, and a lot of it has been well-documented on this subreddit as to what people can do with your food, your time, and your money.

this post went on way longer than i expected, and i apologize for that. i've just had a lot of built-up opinion and experience from doing this job for the last few years. if i can impart a little useful or helpful wisdom to others, then that's more than enough for me. thanks all. be careful, and drive safe out there.",2025-03-30 16:53:32,2,2,Reddit,UberEats
"my solution to tip baiting. thoughts? next to each order, it displays the average dollar amount said customer usually decreases or increases their tip by after delivery.

"ubereats claiming legitimately missing items are ""not eligible for refund"" as a paying uberone member you would think maybe there'd be more consideration but it's getting ridiculous that drinks, appetizers, or entrees are not received more frequently lately and i'm not getting the money back or at least a credit.

the range can be from $6-$20 of basically giving the money away for no product each time, different restaurants. how they find that this is fair is beyond me. 

then if you charge back the amount they basically ripped you off of, they block the account.

i get that that i'm not forced to use them, but this experience completely turned me off.

"uber eats support is crazyyy! calling uber support is one of the biggest wastes of time you could ever experience. they are not there to help drivers—they’re just there to take calls, copy and paste scripted responses, and pretend like they’re “documenting” issues when in reality, they couldn’t care less. they treat drivers like garbage, acting like we’re inconveniencing them by calling for help, even though we’re the ones keeping their entire operation running. the attitude from these so-called “support agents” is disgusting. they talk down to drivers, dismiss real concerns, and make it painfully obvious that their job isn’t to assist—it’s to brush you off and get you off the phone as fast as possible.

and don’t even get me started on uber eats pay. it’s beyond insulting. they expect drivers to take 21-mile trips for $5.65, and that’s for two deliveries combined! that’s barely enough to cover gas, let alone wear and tear on the car or actual profit. the fact that they have the audacity to offer such garbage pay and expect drivers to accept it is nothing short of a scam. they’re taking full advantage of people who are just trying to make an honest living, and they do it without a second thought.

it’s not just me—thousands of drivers are dealing with this same nonsense every single day. if you’re thinking about signing up for uber eats, don’t. it’s not worth the stress, the disrespect, or the insultingly low pay. uber doesn’t care about its drivers, and it shows in every single way they operate. stay far, far away unless you want to work for pennies while being treated like you’re disposable.",2025-03-30 15:39:03,1,3,Reddit,UberEats

well anyway, most of my drivers are actually quite good. however, there is one driver i always have issues with. he does run multiple accounts. sometimes he delivers my food under his own account and sometimes he delivers my food under a females account.  he is always very late.  i always pay for priority where i’m supposed to be delivered first, but i always see his motorbike stopping at another location for several minutes every time.  for some reason, he really likes taking my orders.  i think part of the reason is because i leave a very good tip and my delivery instructions are that i will meet you on the street in front of my apartment building.  i never make drivers navigate security and go up the elevators.  i have found that it’s better for both of us if i just meet them on the street.  so maybe that makes my delivery very attractive to him.

well, today was the perfect storm of annoying me. after he accepted my delivery, i was tracking him on the gps and i saw him making another delivery before he came to me. also, it was raining and he had my food on the floorboard of the moped, so the bag was wet when i got it.  

when he arrived, he goes man. i’m so sorry that i’m late.   by the way, he gives me this apology every single time.  i simply asked him. hey, are you running multiple accounts?  he actually admitted that he was running multiple accounts.  i told him “hey man, i don’t wanna create any problems for you. i am not going to report this.  i am going to give you a thumbs up, and i am going to give you your full tip.  please do not accept my deliveries anymore”. 

he said ok no problem, sir. i got it. 

so i wanted to ask some of the drivers, do you think i handled the situation fairly on my end?",2025-03-30 10:53:59,2,4,Reddit,UberEats

the in-store offers (buy one get one item type stuff) disappeared too. i asked customer service for help, got transferred four times, hung up on twice. they wanted screenshots of my promos. who on earth...? nevermind. i guess anyone that uses uber should now screenshot every step of their order. i learned though, i took as many screenshots of the chat as i could before they hung up on me again. wild.

"cancellation rates and pick up times. two questions:
1. how long does it give you to pick up an order for it to be an “on-time” pickup. as i’ve delayed picking something up for 5 minutes or so as usually that helps make sure i’m not waiting extra long for them to catch up to online orders especially during busy hours. and same with drop offs how long? especially when they tack on another order when you accepted one and they make you go to that place before dropping off the first one. i feel my metrics have been struggling because of this.


2. do you get anything for waiting for an order and having to cancel because it takes too long? just had it twice at this store completely backed up and people started getting hostile so needed to leave. i asked support and they say no. i look it up and a help thing popped up saying they do pay partial for cancellation when you wait for 15+ minutes. i waited at least 25. but a 404 error pops up quickly after opening that site. and support doesn’t care.",2025-03-30 04:34:10,2,1,Reddit,UberEats

"puck fopeyes... is popeyes even a real restaurant? or just a front for something that occasionally makes chicken to keep up appearances.  
it's only my first week of driving, so i'm still making mistakes and learning the do's and don'ts

tonight i was just about to call it quits and suddenly a $35 offer pops up! for only about 6 miles distance. and its on my way home, score! i thought... i drive there and park, the lobby doors are locked of course. and there's a line for the drive thru.... but i want that $35 so i get in the drive thru lane and wait..  
after about 10 minutes its finally my turn at the dark dimly lit drive thru menu (i couldn't actually see the speaker it was so dark and sketchy) and a staticky voice calls out from the dark ""can i help you?"" i start to talk ""yeah, i have an order for......."" and she cuts me off ""i dont have any uber eats or doordash orders""  
umm ok? i'm confused, then why do i have an order for it? she responds with ""iownno"" (thats  a conjunction of: ""i don't know"" with emphasis i don't care)

  
after this short exchange (30 seconds) i admit defeat and pull ahead, and mysteriously the cars ahead of me were gone, nobody was waiting for food. so i pulled into the parking lot and wasted another 10 minutes with support trying to figure things out and finally canceling the order...  (big fail, time lost, gas wasted, income lost) i was hoping they would at least compensate me a buck or two for making half the trip. but the support agent wouldn't budge and kept asking if he should cancel the order.

  
this isn't the first time i've had a problem with popeyes. years ago (the last time i tried to eat there) i placed an online order on the popeyes website and get to the store and they have no order for me.  it's consistently terrible all across the country. and after experiencing the delivery driver side of it its not any better. how are they even still in business? it has to be a front",2025-03-30 02:18:17,3,3,Reddit,UberEats

"has uber ever charged you with cancelling an order - that you didn’t? here are three scenarios i have found to be a pattern and practice.

being sent to a business that is closed.  then there is no order to cancel - and certainly the driver who has lost earnings and time and gas and wear and tear … should not receive punitive treatment that are intended to reduce earning power and opportunities. uber knows when these businesses close - so why does it accept those orders from the customer - and give a fraudulent contract to the driver.  certainly the app - which is uber (they want to claim) and uber is the app - can be programmed to do this.

being sent to a business that doesn’t have the item in stock.  then again there is no order to cancel and the driver wasted all of the above again - and then is hit with a punitive 1 percent raise in cancellation score.  but how and when did the driver become responsible for uber’s failure to have the item delivered to the customer.  and certainly the app can be programmed to require the business to confirm it has an item before accepting an order and making a contractual offer to the driver to pick up and deliver.  otherwise uber should charge the business and provide all of that charge to the driver.

being sent to a business and being told you are the third driver to come for that order - the first one picked it up - thus no order to deliver - and you and the second one receive no compensation for the promise to pay in what they contractually offered you.  and worse again they take punitive action declaring the driver responsible for cancelling the order - again threatening to reduce the contracted individual’s ability to earn.

now - silly-“support” will tell you that is uber’s policy.  so have you asked for a copy of the policy?  is there such a formal written and published and provided to the contracted drivers to accept or reject?

are all uber and uber ears drivers that desperate for earning peanuts usually as a second job - that they merely defer like sheep to their shepherd leading eventually to the slaughterhouse?

i have asked for this cancellation policy.  i got about 100 support members to simply repeat “that’s uber’s policy” - ok produce it in writing and show when and where it was made a part of the contract by drivers accepting it.  i said what kind of policy is neither written nor published nor distributed to the contractor to consent to as part of the contract?  then one philippine lytle “support” minion said “it’s not that kind of policy” begging the question.

they are taking punitive action on you every day in a manner you have no power to prevent or avoid.  for something you are not responsible for but uber is and occasionally the business.  do you really enjoy this kind of facially unfair and unjust discrimination and punishment - when uber isn’t losing money on it - but the driver is (and more)?

after two days of multiple hours of demanding “support” produce this (among other related issues and facts i was and continue to dispute with them) - i finally got on cut and paste minion/repeat what the computer screen says minion to put me through to the “support specialist” for this area - and unbelievably he produced policies and contract related written and published material.

but … no particular policy that defines an act of cancellation and automatically assigns it to the driver.  regardless of the facts and the fact that the driver didnt cancel an order they accepted.

so uber is acting arbitrarily and in violation of the independent contractor contract.

i won’t stand for being treated this way.  why do others?

anyway the above three scenarios i identify because of two things - their absurdity and absurdly unjust nature; and because they have happened to me several times not once - and thus constitute a pattern and practice of violating, at minimum, our contractual rights.

i’ll share the particulars of many of these incidents - but i wonder who else has had these or other scenarios punished them with a 1% increase in driver cancellations - pretty significant since if these things happen to you more than five times, you will not be able to be at platinum or diamond status - which is uber”s conscious intent on programming the app to automatically calculate your status using this algorithm - which somebody deliberately programmed, and and someone, in writing, instructed them to program into the app

anyone else experience a version of these three.  tell us about it.  have you experienced a different scenario where you were unjustly declared to have cancelled an order?  how did that scenario go down?

this has got to stop.  i will be filing my second federal trade commission complaint against uber on this abuse.

ftc complaints process is a unique opportunity for you to speak outside of the pseudo “support” firewall and directly to uber - and to the top at uber.

what you write in the complaint will not only be investigated by the ftc - your words (and what they may add) will be sent to and read by those people.  more significantly - they will be required to reach out to you to address what you brought to their attention.

"uber's 'display overlay in apps' causes accidental acceptances, increasing cancellation rates! uber’s “display overlay in apps” feature can cause drivers to accidentally accept orders, leading to an increase in their cancellation rate. this happens because the overlay may pop up unexpectedly while drivers are using other apps, resulting in unintended taps. uber should address this issue to prevent unfair penalties for drivers.

"driver stole my food and uber doesn't care. any ideas/help? last night around 12:50am my partner and i ordered mcdonalds and we connected the order to our alexa while we waited and watched tv. alexa told us that the uber driver has picked up the order and was on the way so we started paying attention to the phone. 

mcdonalds was only a mile and a half away so when my partner checks his phone he goes ""oh! they're on a bike."" and i was like 'oh, show me' and we watched ""ava"" enter the complex on the complete opposite side and start down the parking lot.

as we're staring at the screen, the phone and alexa chimed and display that our order has been delivered...?? excuse tf me.

so i go to my apartment door and wait outside on the stairs for any sign of the ""biker"" but 5-8 minutes later, nothing. it's at this point that i contact help the first time. no help or resolution. so i call her to see what happened

she tells me that mcdonald's ""dropped my order off"" with someone else and told her to cancel it when she got there...if that's the case, why did i hear my alexa tell me it was picked up? then she says that she isn't on a bike and kinda insists that shes not on a bike. at that point i'm like ""if you canceled the order, why did still connect me to your phone number"" and she said she didn't know and laughed about it. i hung up

after that i put in several more (like 3 or 4) help reports because i'm frustrated as hell, and we're not gotten back to. this morning my partner gets a response at work saying that since they can't ""prove"" she stole it, they can't refund us at all. i googled uber eats support phone number and when i call the number the uber eats website gave it, the voice says something like ""we are no longer doing phone calls from customers for customer support. please contact us through the help page in our app. thank you! goodbye. and it hung up

the way she seemed to have perfectly planned this in her favor (free food and got the payment) makes me believe that shes done this before and she knows it works. it's completely ridiculous that she's allowed to get away with this and there has to be a way to contact a real person to get this sorted out. she didn't ""try to contact me"" bc she couldn't find me, there was no delivery picture and she didn't even get close to the drop off point. that should be proof enough. please tell me if this post violates anything and i'll fix it, i just have no idea what else i'm supposed to do if uber is going to ignore me. thank you",2025-03-29 02:12:28,1,8,Reddit,UberEats

i feel sorry for the new dasher because he is getting a solid 1.50 tip now because fk this sht. i tipped a good amount to get my food within 30 minutes as that was the initial eta and here it is, 90 minutes later and the dude is just now heading my way. 

not his fault my original dasher dropped the order but also not my problem that dashers are able to do just say ""fk it and drop the order"" either.. go get mad at the company because, sometimes people utilize doordash/ubereats for convinience and actually rely on the eta. 

it's not acceptable for me to spend $50 bucks on a pizza and be told the eta is 10-20 minutes only for a driver to accept the order, be on his way, then randomly decide he doesn't want to do it anymore.  now a new driver has to be found and accept the order and that'll take xyz amount of time. 

i feel bad for this driver but at the same time, i'm the customer who's paying for this service. paying the fees and literally paying their income so, if you get the sht end of the stick, not my issue. the system is broken go scream at your employer. not me or those who use a service that's available to use. 

too bad bc the original driver was getting a nice $12 tip off of a $20 pizza... the new driver got fkd and got a $1.50 tip.

"another rant man, i swear this app was developed by 2 monkeys and a toad. and the toad is the smart one. anyways, a match order popped up for a little over $2 a mile. i accept it and got the message it was taken but as we all know, there’s still a chance it will pop up shortly after. i stay on the app for a couple minutes to see if i get it and nothing. i go about scrolling my social media for about 10-15 minutes. in that time i didn’t get any notifications for new orders to which i think, man it’s slow for a friday. so i go and check the app. what do you know, i ended up getting the order and i’ve been sitting here completely unaware of it wasting my time as well as the customers.

the silver lining? it was a panera bread and wingstop order that likely wasn’t going to be ready when i got there. however, in hind sight, i should have just unassigned the order since now my on time rate will likely drop along with the customer removing their tip since it took longer. this is one of many many issues i deal with using this hardly functioning app. do better uber and stop hiring your developers/engineers off wish. end rant.",2025-03-28 20:18:37,1,1,Reddit,UberEats

"vent about app glitching and customer reporting as order not received it was slow and i was desperate so i took a low-paying order, a $10 batch with 2 stops. i got to the first customer's house and delivered as normal, but when i went to mark as delivered, suddenly my app glitched. it refused to upload the picture, so i called and texted the customer to let her know her food arrived and told her i was having app issues. she texted back ""thanks"" and then i tried to mark it as delivered. app refused to let me mark it as delivered. i looked back inside to see if she got her food and she grabbed the food from where i put it, so i know she got it.

i did everything. restarted the app over and over. suddenly not only did the app stop working, my data entirely stopped working and i couldn't even load google. desperate, i restarted my phone and then it decided to freeze on the startup for 15 minutes. i was almost out of gas and needed the money so i started crying, feeling like i was at my breaking point.

eventually my phone started up again but i still couldn't connect, so i drove a mile away to the nearest mcdonald's to mark the order as delivered (and wrote in the box that the app was refusing to work). it finally worked, and i noticed the second customer cancelled their order.

an hour later, i get hit with a ""order not received"" message, a thumbs down, and a report about being unprofessional with the customer. the @#$# lied about not getting her order when i saw her grab it and gave me a thumbs down just because i couldn't mark her order as delivered and i literally explained to her i was having app issues.

this is probably the worst day i've had on this app and i already had 1 tip baiter and 1 other false reporter in the past.

tl;dr: app glitched and wouldn't work, then phone glitched, customer grabbed food then lied and reported as not delivered and unprofessional and gave thumbs down for no reason despite being given a heads-up.",2025-03-28 19:40:20,1,1,Reddit,UberEats

my order was supposed to arrive an hour after i canceled it, so the delivery driver was no where close to my house.

but i was charged freaking $42.31. 23.99 (food) + 14.99(delivery fee) + 3.12 (service fee????) + 2.11(tax).

after calling uber and the restaurant like 6 times, i understand that the restaurant prepared my food so i have to pay for that, but why am i paying for delivery and what service????

also, the delivery driver was supposed to return my canceled food, but she never did (confirmed with restaurant). which probably means she had a really nice dinner paid by me. this is definitely against their policy but their stupid help button only connects me to support who has no authority & every other number is blocked so i can't even call them.

"looking for suggestions as a customer perhaps there is a thread with best practices for a customer but i have not found it. 

i am looking for two things:

1. what should i do to ensure delivery in the future
2. how should i have handled my recent problem better

i have ordered more than a dozen times without incident until recently.  i generally order and ask for delivery to my door and watch the app for the delivery person to arrive.  i generally get to the door right before or immediately after the drop off and thank the driver.

the recent incident occurred as follows:  

ordered with delivery to the door and watched for the delivery driver.  i traced him to a nearby street and then was told it was delivered.  per the app, i called the driver and asked him where he delivered it. he told me to look at the picture. it was another door nowhere on my street that i could see. i asked him to please return so that i can see him since i was standing outside and never even saw his car. he was obviously experienced since he blurted out something like ""i used the gps, delivered to your door, and waited for you to come out appropriately.""  i told him that i use four different gps tools and none of them have a problem finding my address. he told me to call ubereats. finding that number is easier on a smartphone than on a computer, so i started a chat on my computer (that lasted over 90 minutes).

while on the chat waiting sometimes 20-30 minutes for responses, i found a number to call on my phone app.  i connected to a human who said she would help.  she connected me to the driver who mumbled the same drivel he said to me and the agent said that he did what was necessary so there is no refund.  according to her, since he ""used"" a gps i have to pay. i was aghast and asked, ""how do you know he knows how to use a gps?"" she replied the same mantra over and over to each question i asked her. i asked for a supervisor or manager and she told me i would get a callback because none are available.

an hour later, i finally had a response on the chat and was told that they could only refund the cost of the food.  the delivery person is entitled to the tip.  i took that refund and re-ordered and picked up the food (which somehow now cost me 50¢ more than before.  no issues.  

then i tried to untip the driver and learned that i only have an hour to untip the driver for delivering horribly wrong. i went out this morning looking for the door in the picture.  i found it nearby.  i live on 999 abc street and he delivered to 999 xyz avenue. yes. he found the number somewhere.  i went back on the chat still open from the day before and eventually was told i would have my tip refunded.  

as i indicated: 

how should i order in the future so that a driver cannot hide behind ""i used a gps"" to force me to pay for food he gives to someone else?

how do i contact support without getting the runaround?

as an aside, why does the app tell me to contact the driver if there is a problem when the drivers can just hide behind, ""i used a gps so tough on you""

thank you!",2025-03-27 09:49:40,5,9,Reddit,UberEats

"weird drop-offs so i’ve been doing food delivery for about 6 weeks.  i don’t know what is up with uber eats but i have gotten a number of strange drop-offs.  i wouldn’t go so far as to say i felt unsafe (i am a 43f) but i’ve felt uncomfortable with the situation.  and i guess the frustrating thing is you don’t know the situation until after you pick up the food and are on the way.  at that point you can’t unassign the delivery (that i know of).

take yesterday for example, it showed the delivery being at a high school so i accepted (even though i already hate delivering to schools cause their security is crazy).  but on the way i get a notification to deliver it to the office.  it was after school hours.  so moments after i arrive at the parking lot the customer sends me a message saying ‘leave at stairs by the entrance of the lot’.  i see the stairs but they are fenced with a gate.  so i ask him if i should leave it by the gate and he replies ‘hide it and take a pic’.  now like i said, schools are intimidating with all their security cameras and no trespassing signs.  i went ahead and did it but i stressed about it the rest of the night thinking i was on camera leaving a package right outside the school.  

in the future i would love to avoid these type of situations but i don’t know how to.  any tips would be super helpful!!  

what would you have done?  ",2025-03-26 20:54:45,5,5,Reddit,UberEats

"slight rant: hey drivers! being asked to confirm in front of the employee is not a bad thing! here’s why… long post: read numerical points to get to the point

delivery driver and restaurant worker here!



you can tell which of you have worked in a restaurant and which ones haven’t. some of y’all are very rude about being asked to confirm an order, so let me just set the record straight so you can keep this in mind the next time you wanna try and ruin someone else’s mood because for being asked to press a button. 

you clearly are not aware of the amount of fake delivery driver accounts that thieves use to steal people’s food causing the restaurant to lose money, customers to get angry with employees, and employees to get in trouble with their boss. (if this doesn’t apply to you then don’t act like it)

i’m not saying that confirming “prevents” theft or guarantees that it won’t happen, but the platform still needs to able to see the order history to track what happened in case the customer complains. if it’s not recorded that the order was picked up then the customer and uber can be left to assume that the restaurant or employees were responsible for the failure to deliver. this shouldn’t have to be explained.

if drivers need to double check the food, there’s a civil way to communicate that and the worker will have no issue letting you do so. if you’re annoyed by this, that’s ego. again, it costs zero cents. if you’re being asked to confirm before being handed the food even though they brought it out, you can check the food after confirming. problem solved! 🤡if you’re annoyed by this, that is also ego.

other important reasons we need to see you confirm since y’all got no common sense:

1. drivers occasionally show up too late to pickup, or they like to confirm after they get in their vehicle and forget to confirm the order immediately probably because they get caught up on tiktok before they start driving. and because too much time goes by, the customer gets their order too late and it looks like it’s because the restaurant took too long to hand it off. this can hurt the reputation and reviews of the establishment. the app may then send another driver to pick up the one that’s already been picked up. now you wasted that other driver’s time! 

2. drivers may also take the food and if they cancel/unassign without confirming, it looks like the food was never picked up. then the same order goes to several drivers each time costing uber $3 for a no show because it looks like ""somebody already picked up the food."" this happens at our restaurant several times when we didn’t used to take confirming seriously. that's why the restaurant makes you confirm meaning you picked up the food and it's with you. like… duh.

3. an establishment doesn’t get paid if you cancel by clicking another driver picked it up if they actually didn't. so they give out free food. it's a safeguard that you don't say you’re here for an order, take the food and cancel in the parking lot which would send another driver while the customer never gets the food. then uber issues a credit and never pays the restaurant for the order.

the little loopholes that drivers can employ can lead to many problems for the restaurant if employees don’t make sure you verify that you got the order! allowing them to watch you confirm the pickup does no harm to you and literally costs nothing if you have no bad intentions. anyone who is offended by this is arrogant, period. there are plenty of drivers who have no issue confirming for us but there’s always those few egomaniacs who think their 💩 is too pure to show the employer that your order is confirmed because you’re making it about having to prove yourself. again, this ain’t about you 🙄

i understand that some of you don’t wanna be bossed around on your own time, but you need to cut that out. because 1. that’s not what’s happening. it’s not about you. 2. most employees are required to do this whether they like it or not so giving them crap doesn’t change or do anything but send that person off with negative energy when they didn’t do anything to deserve it. it’s not their fault. but when you don’t want to confirm it’s suspicious, arrogant, annoying, entitled and out right rude.

as a delivery driver myself, the employee doesn’t even have to ask me to let them watch me confirm because i grew up with some degree of home training and respect for others. don’t give us an attitude when we kindly ask you to let us watch you confirm the order. you’re literally pressing or swiping on a screen once. it takes at most .02 seconds. please for the love of christ, get over yourselves. 

i will ignore rude comments with any hint of attitude. i said what i said. thanks!

"no refund on cold food. i get that it's ubereats' policy and everything. but i ordered food at 4pm (on a friday) from a store 2 miles away. a 7 minute drive in my city. $41 dollars of food was wasted because it took an hour to get to me... none of that makes sense. the store messed it up too so i got a partial refund for that but it was $3. every single item except the burgers we got were ice cold. it was mcdonalds. you cannot eat that even 10 minutes after it was made.

i tweeted at them too, this was their response ""we sincerely apologize that we didn't meet your expectation. it's understandable that you would feel disappointed when your order arrived cold. after carefully reviewing your case, we regret to inform you that per our policy, we won't be able to provide you with a price adjustment for this order. kindly note that we couldn't offer compensation for orders being the wrong temperature...""

edit: thanks for all the downvotes guys! fyi i am unable to pick up my own food unless my mom is helping me (which i'd never ask her to do) and every single day i live in extreme pain, i couldn't walk 0.2 miles let alone 2 in its entirety. my bf is neurodivergent and its his money, so i'm angry on his behalf that he couldn't have one of his favorite safe foods. also, usually delivery arrives hot/warm/fresh to me. i rarely get a cold meal and thats usually if its from far away or late at night.",2025-03-26 00:49:07,0,28,Reddit,UberEats

i went through 4 different delivery drivers that all sat at the wingstop for 20-30 minutes until just cancelling on my pickup. is this normal? who’s at fault in this instance? im not necessarily mad at this point, i’m just trying to figure out what in the world happened.",2025-03-25 21:29:06,1,12,Reddit,UberEats
i figured it out so i accepted an order where the restaurant  didn't have the specifics of a customers order. i contacted the customer and they told me to cancel. i contacted support informing them of the cancelation. they reached out to the customer and confirmed and told the customer how to cancel. i waited about 5 minutes for the customer to cancel uber support then used my cancelation rate and canceled the order and said nothing we can do. i had a similar situation a couple of days earlier where the restaurant didn't have the specifics of a customers order and i called uber support the person said they would cancel it wouldn't affect my rate and they would compensate me in which they did in that exact moment. what's the difference between these two orders the order today the lady had a heavy accent the one before didn't. i'm assuming that uber eats has an overflow service that they are using to take calls that can't go directly to them. so if you want better service call during non busy times about your orders because thier overflow sucks.,2025-03-25 21:28:23,1,1,Reddit,UberEats

they have the worst customer service i’ve ever experienced with little to no options to connect to an actual representative and when you do they’re useless.

after 30 minutes of trying to get a hold of an agent by clicking any option that would likely get me there because, most of their support page is useless helpless articles.

anyway i finally connect and they tell me they can’t cancel because someone is on the way. i explain he’s very very far from the restaurant and for that the order was delayed an additional 60 minutes to the already 30 that it was delayed previously. they tell me they need transfer me to a specialist lol. and then this happens 5 times!!!!!!

after 2 hours of going back and forth and not receiving this order they finally agree to cancel it. in other words you can’t cancel an order unless they allow it. f*** these big corporations!

"people that make the drop-off unnecessarily difficult/annoying (usually non-tippers too) hey everyone! been doing uber eats deliveries for a while. over 2k deliveries. i always google what i experience and find that a discussion about it has always already happened on reddit and lurk/read a lot. it helps me get over my irritation by reading people rant about the same things that annoy me. i just wanted to add my own quick thing that happened not too long ago.

just had a person put in their notes ""call me when you get here, don't knock"". so i park so perfectly in front of their townhouse that i'm actually using their own numbered parking spot. the front door is right ahead, don't even have to turn my neck to look at it. i call the number while still in my car. it rings twice and goes to voicemail. i get out with a bag in one hand, drink in the other, thinking maybe i should start walking up to the door, or at least be visible outside of my car. nothing. i start fumbling for my phone with full hands, and before i can text them i get a text: ""are you here"". 

are you kidding me? so before i can respond to the are you here via text while i'm standing at the front door, the front door opens. i then tell the customer ""i tried calling you but i got no answer"". the customer says ""sorry i didn't hear it"". of course, no tip (it was a short trip that didn't take me far from my house so i took it). on top of that, some weirdo was idling in their car next to mine the whole time, making me stay there longer than i needed to.

i've ordered food from uber eats at least 100 times before i became a driver. i'm a ""leave at door"" person, my house number is very visible, and i actually know how to wait for them to leave it and go before i open the door. why do some people have to make bringing food harder than it should be?",2025-03-25 14:37:25,1,2,Reddit,UberEats

"uber eats lying about refund system being down?  i ordered uber eats last sunday (march 15th) from a restaurant, it gave me the option of adding a grocery/convenience store order to it with free delivery etc, which i did. i usually buzz drivers into my building but ask that they leave the order by the apartment door as i have 4 cats and they will run out if someone is standing there. the driver left the order, when i open the door (1 minute after he left), the convenience store bag was there but not the restaurant one. i tried messaging and calling the driver several times with no luck, i honestly dont know if he got confused with the 2 orders or stole my food, idec tbh. so i call uber, speak to an agent, they tell me they have to try to contact the driver too - which they do with no luck, so they tell me i'm eligible for a refund. i asked for uber cash so i could just reorder the same thing as it would be instant and they tell me i'm all good to go and should see it in my account within 5 minutes. i waited 1 hour and nothing, so i call back, speak to a different agent and then i'm told that their system is down and they can't refund anyone at the moment and their solution is for me to call them back in 24hrs to check if the system was running again. annoying, but i call again on monday night and they tell me the same thing, but this time they me i can get uber cash, just not money back - which is what i wanted since i ended up getting the food on my partner's app anyway the day before. i cal again on wednesday and then on friday, and they tell me the system is down for refunds ""in my region"" and it is already aware of it, but they have no eta. one of the agents also told me it was a problem with my bank, and at that point i called my bank who told me it was nothing on their end and they never had this problem with uber eats before. anyway, at this point it's been a week, i spoke to several different agents and they still they me they cannot refund me even though i am eligible for a discount and that i need to keep calling back. everytime i call back i have to explain the same story over and over again and it's driving me crazy. i thought about opening a dispute with my bank but i am worried i will have to use uber again in the future when i travel (some countries have uber as their only ride option other than taxi) and they will lock my account. so i guess my question now is: is uber lying to me and trying to get me to give up calling? has anyone been through this? it sounds crazy that a multimillionaire company like that would have a refund system down for this long only in one specific region.

"getting rid of tipping ahead really screwed both drivers and customers edit: apparently uber eats has only gotten rid of tipping ahead in certain areas, so if you are not experiencing this, i’m happy for you. i hope they don’t get rid of it for where you live and they change it back where i live.

anyways

i worked in the service industry for years as a teen. i don’t eat out or order delivery unless i can afford a good tip as well.

i just waited over an hour for a driver to pick up my order (it was sitting on “restaurant is finishing up your order!” for an hour), and probably because it was a small one and uber’s order pay scaling doesn’t compensate drivers enough.

my order was like $20. before they got rid of tipping ahead i never had this issue cause on cheap orders like this i tip 50% or more. i would have (and in the past, have) gladly slapped $10-$15 tip on upfront just to get my food to me in good shape.

my food is about to be delivered probably cold and soggy and over an hour late but i’m tipping this guy $20 just on principle for picking it up even though he was probably only offered like $1.50 for the delivery by uber.

it’s not the drivers fault. this new app model sucks. if uber isn’t going to compensate its drivers well, then bring back tipping ahead, for everyone’s sake please.",2025-03-24 19:33:35,10,40,Reddit,UberEats

i contacted support, and after going back and forth, they admitted that the promo had been deactivated—after i ordered. if the promo wasn’t valid, why was it even showing as available? this is basically bait-and-switch.

their response? “according to the terms and conditions, uber reserves the right to disable promo codes and marketing campaigns.” so they can just revoke a promo whenever they feel like it? that’s cheating.

last night i had the worst one yet. it had a little ways to go and it was stacked with another delivery, and by the time i got to the customer this bag had literally disintegrated. the bottom was mushy from the grease and the top of the bag was just…gone. none of the food had actually fallen out but the topmost layer of fries was exposed. i always keep a stash of plastic produce/meat bags in my car to protect deliveries in the rain and snow, so i placed one over top of the fg bag and then carefully scooped the whole thing into another bag. i explained what happened to the customer and offered to cancel the order for being damaged in transit, but they were ok with it. i wasn’t, though. i’m a food safety dork and while i know i did everything i could to avoid contamination, i’m pretty sure i committed some sort of violation. and i know damn well there are a lot of filthy drivers who would have just picked up that mess and left it for the customer like it was. 

anyway, if you’d like to let five guys know that you would appreciate better packaging and have a minute to call 1-866-345-guys, please do so. i’m sure a few of you “it’s not my job to care” types will downvote me, but maybe if enough drivers and customers let them know they’ll figure something else out.

i’m a uber eats driver and every time i get a $2 or $3 order (no tip) i instantly reject it, and it’s not only me it’s every single driver out there who does the same thing. so when you place a no tip order it gets passed on from driver to driver being rejected by all of them and taking a long time for it to be accepted. “but my no tip orders always get accepted and then delivered” well yes, of course but slower than usual because what uber does is after the order has been rejected many times uber adds more money (usually 10cents each time) to the order each time it pops up and they keep doing this until someone finally accepts it. but it has already taken some time and your order will be delivered way slower than it should. 

so always tip before and consider tipping $2 per mile of restaurant to place of delivery. whenever i see a good tipping order i’ll make your order be delivered as fast as possible and efficiently. i’ll even consider screaming, honking and hell, i’ll even flip the finger at them slow drivers so they get the hell outta my way. 

pd: you can always remove the tip after if you experience a bad delivery or inefficient one. ",2025-03-23 00:57:10,0,18,Reddit,UberEats

 insta cart restaurant orders are powered by uber eats and having delivery from uber eats was the absolute worst experience i have ever had. 

 1st - the delivery person forgot more than half of my order at the restaurant.  

2nd - they lied to me about the issue and screwed me out of support claiming he canceled the order.

 3rd - i was coached to re-order since i would not be charged the first time (i was charged) so i did...this order arrived later than expected, was missing items again and was cold. 

i have a 5yo and a newborn.  i had come home from working a long day and just needed to get dinner checked off for the family - i started this whole order through insta cart at 5:30pm and didn't have anything to show for it until 9:15pm...

while juggling the 2 kids (one beingva fussy baby) i was trying to connect with any kind of customer service for support.  insta cart abandoned to the wolves that is uber eats and uber eats threw me into an infinite loop of ai scripted responses.  

horrible. awful. horrendous.   these are words i would apply to uber eats.  cowardly also applies as they hide behind the scripted ai responses instead of offerreal support.

"do not all markets allow customer to add more tip after delivery? i have never personally ordered uber eats as a customer when i’m in my home town. i just work ue on the side to make extra money. 

i was on vacation at wdw last week and for the first time ever, ordered ue delivery to my hotel. the app allowed me to select my hotel from their address list and then click the option to have it delivered straight to my door (rather than left in the lobby). it even had all the building and room numbers pre-populated in their app. so i was surprised, albeit skeptical, that this room door delivery. would be allowed

when the driver got there he said he was in the lobby and the hotel wouldn’t let him drive it back to my room (i believe he was telling the truth). i called down to the front desk and asked them if he could leave it there. they said no. i was in my pajamas with wet hair from a shower and the lobby is so far from my room that it’s not within walking distance, so i didn’t want to have to make the driver wait. front desk said no he can’t leave it here. you have to come meet him directly. 

so i had to change back into regular clothes and drive down to the lobby to meet the poor guy. by the time all was said and done he had been there nearly 10 minutes. 

i felt so bad and wanted to add more on to the initial tip, but couldn’t find the option anywhere in the app. is this not a thing in every area? or am i just not seeing it?

"ubereats is taking advantage / we should fight back ubereats, and other delivery companies are taking advantage of it's drivers by making their pay optional, but making them pay up front to perform their service.

ubereats pays $0 for fleet maintenance. $0. triplea says you pay an average of $0.10 a mile. meaning you have to take this into consideration. they do not, and will tell you they do not.

ubereats pays $0 in gas to deliver. avg gallon of gas for driver: over $3. avg miles per gallon is about 26. this means every gallon of gas you use is generating about $2.60 in vehicle maintenance on average. so here's a quick little equation if the trip was for 26 miles and they're gonna pay you $6 total:  
    
3 + 2.60 = 5.60. $5.60 is your cost to complete the deliver(not counting your return trip if it takes you outside of home area. then it's twice this). so if your total pay is $6 and it cost you $5.60 you made 40 cents. and, you haven't paid taxes.

uber makes good on every delivery no matter what. the food prices are higher. and, they get a percentage fee of the amount spent. a lot of ppl assume the driver is making a decent amount of that, not that they're getting $2.

then when you drive across town to find out the business isn't even open. that's your time, and your gas/maintenance. cost you for their error.

you goto get the delivery. it's all sealed up. they screwed it up, but you don't know. you deliver. customer gets mad, and the driver is the only person they can punish. no tip for you! ubereats still gets paid.

you get there to pickup the delivery, somebody has already picked up. you might be the 7th person, some how, that has returned to get it. too bad! you lose your time, you lose your gas/maintenance money. a possible reason for this: the driver was hungry af and tired of delivering to ppl who expect them to pay to deliver their amazing food and couldn't take it anymore. took a meal, instead of making the $3(minus the $2.50 to complete it). it was worth more to them to get full. not condoning this, just understanding it. 

some times you get an entire grocery order. $700 worth of food. to a 3rd floor apartment. and, the total is $5. wtf kind of piece of garbage human being do you have to be to expect that of another human who already has to pay up front to do this for you? 

these people are not being shamed enough for their behavior and consideration of others.  some of their expectations are, literally, worse than slavery. slavery is when you are not treated well, but taken care of, but you don't get paid for you work. what is happened to drivers is that they are paying upfront to do work. paying to perform labor, and not being taken care of in any way. <-- this is the key to changing our plight imo. i have a collection of screenshots, i'm sure others do, or could have within a cpl days, showing the offers that i would have to pay to complete, or i would make far less than minimum wage. companies who claim to be for equality and such, can't be treating their employees worse than slaves. so, on a large scale, this needs to be brought to the general public's attention. because i don't think many people understand what is actually happening. they just want their food, but if were made aware of the bs would want a change. why does ubereats want their drivers to make less than minimum wage, or be treated worse than slaves? they do, this is fact. i have sent them many screen shots and many support requests about it. they know they are doing it, and they continue to do it. so this is their expectation. if you do not accept them, they will lower your rating for not paying to perform their service for them. this is horrible behavior from any human being. only a slave driver would think it wasn't.

one of the biggest problems is that people who can't afford luxury services are using luxury services every day. if you're on food stamps, you shouldn't be able to use a delivery app. how can you claim you're so poor you need food stamps, but also have enough money to have food delivered to you at raised price? everybody who's ordered knows it ain't cheap. it's a luxory service. and, you therefor understand this is gonna cost me. the delivery companies don't want to do this because they get paid, regardless. doesn't bother them if you spend an hour to make $3 that you paid $2.50 to do. they prob made $5+ of their fee. they're greedy slave drivers. but, you'll never speak to them. you'll speak to patel in india. who's looking at a list of buzz words on a screen, waiting for you to say one, and repeating verbatim what the screen says. anything outside of that... you lose again.

again, i cannot stress that a delivery service is a luxury service. broke people don't need to use it, unless they understand it's a splurge. it comes with an extra cost. like you know other luxurious purchases are gonna come with. you want red lobster delivered to your house, but you don't even want the dude who brings it to you to be able to put a gallon of gas in his car? that's some no home training, pos behavior. there's no argument to this. you do it. that's what you are. you can change, but currently you roll like a pos. 

and, stop the hood-rats. same non-tipping hood-rats order every day, never tip and always have some special instructions, and want you coming to the 5th floor. then they open the door it smells like urine, crap, and body musk and she's standing there in her panties with 4 kids running around. $700 of groceries. no tip, clockwork. if they're gonna be allowed to order delivery, they need a tipvoucher to tip the drivers.

they need to do an ubercharity where people who want to do charity for these people(of which i bet some people would) and let them serve the people who don't want to let a mfer get at least $5 for every order. that's really not even enough, but anything less should literally be criminal. should be able to attack you when i get there for robbing me.",2025-03-20 17:13:18,1,20,Reddit,UberEats

after the next time, a live support person told me to cancel. i told him that was bs - why do i get shafted for driving to a pickup when multiple drivers have been sent out? he said i was probably sent out because the previous driver delivered but didn’t confirm it in the app. so, i texted the customer to ask if she’d received the order. nope. 

picking up an order and not delivering it is fucked up, obviously. the customer gets screwed and another driver will likely get screwed.

i’m trying to sign up as an independent uber eats courier in germany, not as part of a fleet, but i’m running into issues. i’ve already uploaded all required documents, including my business registration and a valid vat identification number. a few days ago, the app was just asking me to upload my vat id, but after doing that today, i suddenly see a warning stating that i *cannot* operate as an independent courier.

i still have access to the uber supplier website, where i successfully uploaded my business registration and vat information. however after contacting them, uber support recently sent me a document that i apparently need to fill out to become a fleet partner. this confuses me because i don’t want to be part of a fleet—i want to operate independently or at least have my own fleet for which i can then deliver

uber eats buy 1 get 1 free trying to understand the system. i recently bought from a restaurant through the uber eats app. the store restaurant was ai susi and teriyaki. they offered quite a bit of items for their buy 1 get one free. i bought 5 items all from their buy 1 get 1 free. but not sure if the restaurant or uber putting caps on the deal but of the 5 items buy one get one free only 3 were honored. went to uber to ask if there was a cap or limit. 2 people stated because 34$ in discounts were applied there wasn't anything else they could do. 1 help desk stated that you have to put 2 in the cart if you want the deal. which isn't true because the system automatically does for you. just wanted some clarification and to see if anyone else ran into this issue. felt like false advertisement. i know at the end of it the total cost of food lost because the buy one get one free wasn't honored is about 30$ buy.  ,2025-03-19 23:08:35,0,3,Reddit,UberEats

you cannot talk to a normal person, instead you have to chat with someone offshore who doesn't give a crap and will end your chat after providing some boiler plate response.

"delivery of stone cold mcdonalds i don’t normally buy the stuff but it was one of those days that come around every couple of years so i thought i’d get an order. 

was all on track until the i got the message of “oops we are looking for a new driver” popped up and then had to wait for another driver and the extended pick up etc. 

got the delivery just after the latest delivery time and was handed a stone cold bag at the door. 

all the fries the burgers etc. cold. and flat. inedible. complained immediately. an hour later told this. 

“sorry to hear about the long wait time.
we have provided partial refund for this order, which should be reflected in the next few business days.
we understand how frustrating it is to have your order take longer than expected. please be assured that our teams are investigating such cases to improve our in-app eta calculation as well as our overall uber eats experience.”

i text them again and said a partial refund is unacceptable. the food was inedible. they don’t even say how much the partial refund is. 

i’m not letting it go as the food was a disgrace and i didn’t normally complain unless it’s really bad. 

is that that then. some basic response and i have to accept all the food in the bin and some refund i don’t know how much for turns up randomly in the next few days? it’s a joke and i’m uninstalling after

it’s now 10:30 and he calls me saying that uber told him to get the cake back. first off all isn’t that a food safety hazard? second of all, upon further inspection this order is from toast. so either this guy was working on two orders from two different apps at the same time, and doesn’t want to get in trouble with the other company or he wants the cake for himself because i highly doubt uber told him to come pick up the cake an hour and some change later. what do y’all think? i wouldn’t want to get an order that was dropped off to someone else that opened the bag already.

"question about uber driver profiles 
is it common for uber eats drivers to make up any profile name and random photo and car description?   i order uber eats at least once a month, occasionally a few times a month.  the last 6 deliveries, the profile picture and car listed as my delivery person does not match. 
ex:  ""marcy"", photo of a white, basic blonde in her 20s, car listed as a newer model honda pilot.. the person who arrived was a black guy in his 40s in a toyota camry.  another was a female's name, pic of a brunette female in her 30s i'd guess, and the person who arrived was a large middle eastern man.  another was an older white lady profile and a newer model sedan, they show up in a beat up van and a teenager brought up the food. 

is this not odd??  
each driver who took my orders were the original profiles who accepted the delivery from the beginning. there were no changes in delivery person, none dropped or declined the order for it to be picked up by another driver. 
is this common with just uber eats?  i imagine if a ride uber didn't match, it'd be more of an issue. ",2025-03-18 22:15:58,1,1,Reddit,UberEats

i made an order which showed the total to be 9.83 cad before the order and during. after the order was delivered the final receipt showed me charge was 10.42. this has happened twice now. i took the screenshot before it was delivered this time. i contacted the support the agent didn't have an explanation for me. she tried to get away with it saying that the 9.83 cad was just an authorization hold which just doesn't make sense. why would you would the show the order total (what you are being charged) and charge higher amount and just say it was authorization hold? has anyone else has this happened to them? the agent transferred my chat to ""specialized team""

"fvck cfa and wing stop wtf chick-fil-a now requires drivers to pick up in the drive thru after 9pm. fuuuuuuuuuck that noise. i’ve always hated dealing with the rude people who work there and avoided picking up from there unless the payout was huge, but now i’m just gonna add that shithole to my nopenever list. 

we just got a wing stop in my city and the first time i picked up an order it was jam packed but my customer’s order was ready. signed the sheet, easy breezy, away i went. second time i waited 20 minutes, got my $3 extra for waiting, and that was that. but tonight…i walked in, signed in, and waited five minutes before anyone even acknowledged me. when they did, this b had the audacity to admonish me for coming too early. she looked at the order and said, “this isn’t expected to be ready until 10:25, see?” and pointed to the “expected time“ under the customers order number. i said, “no, that’s the time it is expected to deliver to the customer.“ and she argued with me up and down and said, “no, their order isn’t expected to be ready until that time.“ then i said, “then why would they send me here now? almost an hour early?“ she just shrugged and said, “it happens a lot lately.” so then i pulled up the other screen, which showed the expected pickup and delivery times and clearly showed expected pickup at 9:46 with an expected delivery of 10:25 (it was a stacked order with another pickup after this one). she said, “well too bad, it’s not ready.” i was on $30/hr flat rate so i didn’t care how long i had to wait but if i hadn’t been, there’s no way. it finally came out at 10 pm and this little troll pulled the bag off the shelf and said, “did you sign in?” i said, “yes i did.” then she said “good. here.” and practically threw the bag at me. i think i’ll be skipping that place too now.

the guy then tells me that he don't have my order because he gave it to someone a few minutes before, he then tells me ""i can either take it back or you can take it but don't ask for a refund"" he then right after tells me with a ""joking tone"" that ""he knows where i live""... which isn't the funniest joke i've heard... so i took the order because it was already late so ordering again wasn't really an option.

i'd still like to get a refund because the food i got wasn't something i was willing to eat and it was probably the junkiest food you could order... but i wouldn't like for the deliverer to come back in front of my house...

moreover, they took an additional 4 dollars from the returned funds for nothing. i asked why, they said that i entered this amount into the tip myself, although according to the receipt i had already paid for it by card, that is, they withdrew additional tips without my consent. it turns out that in the end i paid $ 25 for one drink. what should i do in this situation? i want a full refund and i can at least give this drink back. i wasted more than two hours on this, it is already late at night, they ruined my mood and sleep, and i still have to go to work in the morning. i want to go all the way on principle, because this is not the first time that money has been written off without reason and because there are many like me",2025-03-16 05:13:58,3,1,Reddit,UberEats

three of the closest college campuses do not have any labels on any of the buildings. nor do they have clearly marked and obvious direction signs on the sidewalks.

since i'm a new driver, uber gave me a bunch of promotions to complete x deliveries for a bonus. late last night, i was considering going offline but then i got a $3, 2 mile delivery offer. normally i wouldn't have accepted but i only needed one more delivery for a $10 bonus, so i thought what the hell, sure.

after i picked up the order from taco bell, i got a notification saying the delivery address had been updated. the new address was 26 minutes away and took me out to the middle of nowhere. i thought about cancelling, but i'm really new to this and have no idea wtf i'm doing, so i was afraid there would be negative repercussions if i canceled. 

the crazy thing is that this was a drop-off delivery, and the guy was proudly standing outside of his house waiting for me when i arrived. i don't understand how he didn't feel any shame and was happy to face me after the scam he pulled. 

so i ended up making $3 for almost an hour of my time. uber later gave me an additional $3 ""delivery adjustment"", but that was little consolation. is this a common occurrence with uber eats deliveries, or was i just unlucky?",2025-03-16 03:19:14,1,15,Reddit,UberEats

i have a question on when ue delivery people complete an order. so, when i order sometimes i’ll get the notification that your order has been delivered when i haven’t even seen the person yet (luckily do receive me food). 

however, is this to get a special benefit or bonus for somewhat delivery early? because the order didn’t arrive early, just on time so is this to avoid getting scammed or do ue delivery people get a bonus. i only ask because for me it gets concerning as i believe they delivered to the wrong location and it’s happened once someone delivered to the wrong location, as i have instructions to meet me at the door.

reached out to support, yapping for few copy and paste answers back to me and she disconnected saying i didn't respond... not even minute before i respond.



it is my fault to cancel it, and not knowing which store it is coming from.... i thought since the store closed at the moment, the delivery was going to take longer to arrive.

hit go online. then go to phone settings. search for ""appear on top"" 
go to the uber app and toggle off. 

now you won't get the invasive pop up for orders.  you can accept your orders without worrying of typing outside the app.

the only catch is you have to go online first then settings to toggle off. you can't toggle it off before going online.

i know this has eased my annoyance from them. hope it makes it easier for you",2025-03-15 11:33:59,1,5,Reddit,UberEats
"uber eats and dairy queen screwed me so last night i ordered some dairy queen from uber eats, i'll buy one and get one free chicken basket, a flame thrower burger and a shake, for a total of $37 or so not counting the driver's tip the order was delayed for some reason. possibly cuz of the high wind. we were having it in my area at the time. but eventually makes it to me about 9:30 (i ordered at a a quarter to 8:00) only the only thing that i got was the shake, and the driver said that they told him that that the back that contained my shake was everything. i have attempted to call the dairy queen but all i get some is a voicemail that sounds like somebody's personal phones, voicemail rather than a business voicemail. 

i attempted to use the uber app to seek recompense and all they gave me was $11 in uber cash 

is there any other way to fix the issue, i am considering contacting my bank to start a charge back but i would rather not burn that bridge if i don't have to.",2025-03-15 11:31:58,3,5,Reddit,UberEats

"my driver was forced to drive to the store and back because i wasn’t given a way to cancel an order missing half its items before he’d already arrived i put in an order tonight with the intent of buying two different hard seltzers. due to price limits, i had to add two additional items to the order. 

the store shopped, only to inform me that the two six packs i’d set out to buy were out of stock. i was provided no option at this point to cancel the order, so i reach out to support. 

support connected me within a minute, and i explained my situation. however, the representative i was supposedly online with did not respond. in the next ten minutes, shopping had been completed and the driver had picked it up and brought it to my door. i was handing him my id when the support representative responded and cancelled the order. 

the driver’s phone went off, informing him of the cancelled order and he looked so despondent and told me he had to return the order. i apologized profusely and explained best i could through an obvious language barrier. 

i ended the chat with that support representative and was escalated to someone higher up, who i shared some very choice words with. 

to be clear, i don’t care about the booze — the store was out of what i wanted and that’s that, but the poor man who had my order now isn’t going to get paid 
after wasting time driving to the store and back, because i wasn’t given away to cancel my order after half of it was out of stock. uber doesn’t have a way to let me leave a tip for a man who went on this whole futile delivery because their staff took ten minutes to respond to my inquiry.

"absolute waste of time i had ordered my favorite meal from a local restaurant through uber eats. after a long day, i was excited to finally settle in with some delicious comfort food. the estimated delivery time was 30 minutes, which seemed reasonable. but as the minutes passed, i noticed the time tick by without any sign of my driver. an hour later, i received a notification saying my delivery was “on the way.”

anxiety started creeping in. i checked the app for updates, but the map showed my driver circling around my neighborhood, getting further and further from my house. after 90 minutes, i finally received a message that the driver had arrived—yet there was no knock on the door. i went outside, but there was no sign of the delivery. i called the driver, only to be told he had already left the food in front of my door and “couldn’t wait any longer.”

frustrated, i checked the spot where the food was supposed to be, but it was nowhere to be found. after calling uber eats support, i was told the situation would be investigated. they offered no immediate resolution, only to “look into it” and promised a refund in three to five business days. it took weeks to get my money back, and i still never got that meal. i never ordered from that restaurant again.",2025-03-14 19:58:15,0,1,Reddit,UberEats

"are big grocery adjustments because of my driver? i’m frustrated that uber doesn’t require the driver to give a copy of the receipt to the customer. i just purchased a 70$ order that ended up being 22$ more expensive and i have no idea why beyond the reasoning that there were adjustments. 

this seems like a ridiculous discrepancy and the complete lack of transparency on uber’s end doesn’t help. where is this 22$ coming from? i thought it was because offers through uber for items on sale didn’t reflect their real prices, but even after tallying that up, it doesn’t account for the 22$.

uber immediately agreed to refund the order. they gave about $25 in uber wallet cash to compensate for the promotion and claimed to do a whole refund of around $80 but only actually refunded the $5 i had to put on a credit card. i asked them a few times how they would refund the voucher exactly but they kept responding ignoring what i said and repeating they did a full refund of $80 ""to the account used to pay for the order"". eventually they just ignored my comment and it seems my support request has been closed as i can't comment anymore.

"does anyone else feel uncomfortable ringing doorbells at 2am when uber makes you enter the pin to complete the drop off? it’s always a little annoying compared to the “leave at door” option, but having to make contact with someone in the middle of the night can be very uncomfortable and scary, especially if it’s a home that is not in a well-lit area or off the grid and not even in a subdivision. sometimes people enter the wrong address or someone else orders them food unbeknownst to them and i’m always worried that if ring or knock in the middle of the night, i’ll wake someone up and get shot by some nutjob who lives there. if it were up to me, i simply would decline pin deliveries this late at night, but uber won’t tell you that a pin is required until after the food is picked up. a couple times, the house was pitch black and it didn’t even look like anyone was awake, so i just hit “customer can’t find pin” and left it at the door. whether they got the food, i don’t know, but i wasn’t going to start knocking on the door of a house where everyone seemed to be asleep in the middle of the night and it doesn’t seem right (or safe) that uber expects me to do so. does anyone else share these sentiments and what do you do in this situation?",2025-03-14 10:32:15,13,22,Reddit,UberEats

""what do you mean by sketchy?"" he says.  i tell him, well, usually a name pops up but for customer name for you its ""dogggstarr"" which is weird and now this phone call isnt usual so if i get there and theres underage people there or whatever i'm just turning back around.

"talking to support as a customer long story, obligatory on mobile so apologies for any formatting issues. i placed an order at 8:00p last night for a pizza place that i live roughly 15m from. estimated delivery was 9:00p. 9p comes and goes, i see a different driver gets assigned after it looked like they were waiting a while on a double order. 930 comes and goes. another driver gets assigned. at 9:55 (5 minutes before the store closed) i get a call from the //third// driver assigned to my order. they state the restaurant told him that my order had been cancelled twice and the drivers had been told to return it to the restaurant by uber. he wanted to make sure i wanted the order. i told him of course i wanted the order, i never cancelled it and have been waiting almost 2h from placing the order. i used to live a little closer to the pizza place and know some of the staff so i called the store personally. they said they didn’t know what was going on, only what the drivers told them. food finally gets to my house by 10:20p. the pizza is cold and my wife and i were both hesitant to eat it from how many people have passed it around. 

i did what any reasonable person would do and tried to contact customer service. there was no phone number in the app, so i googled one. the numbers that came up were either not in service or it had an automated voice that referred you back to the app. i had not had a good experience trying to use chat support before but decided to try. i get through to a “person” and i swear to god, this has to be a bot looking for specific words. i explained the situation in a fairly concise manner and the “rep” asked me if i was trying to cancel my order, told me to contact the restaurant or the driver and i would be charged if i cancelled. i told him, no, i didn’t want to cancel, i wanted a refund for late food and cold food, seeing as this was their problem, cancelling the order twice and reassigning it while it was already in transit to my house. the guy asked me if my food had been delivered yet, i said it had been, it was cold and had been handled by 3 different drivers. after all of this, he gives me $9.96 in “uber cash” i told him i didn’t want uber cash, i wanted a refund of the whole amount and he disconnected the chat. idk if i’m crazy or not but these messages don’t sound like a person.

i may have just been swindled. ubereats driver states they spilled drink in my driveway. they never even made it to my street. i followed in the app and they were several streets over. they said the concrete in my driveway was ""uneven"" and they tripped and spilled the coffee. we have no uneven concrete on our driveway, so i knew right away they were not telling the truth. there was no sign of spilled coffee anywhere near my porch or driveway and there would have definitely been evidence had they spilled that much coffee. the photo shows the coffees are empty. it looks like they just drank them. they did state they drove back to the coffee place to have them remake it, but the place would not do it for free. i did call the coffee shop, and the story of that did actually check out. i asked them why they opted not to have the coffees remade over what appeared to be an honest mistake. the coffee shop stated they would remake it for me but i am not able to pick it up because i'm already at work. the only real recourse you have anymore is calling the restaurant directly because these delivery apps will never offer a refund. my guess is the delivery driver just drank the coffee (she was with her boyfriend), and then created the lie of spilling the coffee and went back to the coffee shop to have them remake it. i filed a complaint with ubereats and my bet is they won't refund me. the photo below is not my house (we don't have wood lying around there anywhere).

"refund issue in ubereats 

i recently placed an order on uber eats, but i ran into a serious issue with the discount and refund process.

at first, my order was automatically canceled because the app applied two coupons at the same time. i didn’t apply them myself—the app did it automatically. when i tried ordering again, i was charged $80 with no discount applied at all. however, both coupons completely disappeared from my account.

since the discount was missing, i immediately contacted the restaurant within a minute of placing the order. the restaurant advised me to contact uber to cancel the order, so i followed their advice and canceled it.

however, when i reached out to uber, they refused to issue a full refund, claiming that the food had already been prepared. i don’t understand how that’s possible.

i asked uber to properly verify the situation, but they just repeated the same response. if i canceled the order right after placing it, who actually incurred a loss in this situation?

has anyone else dealt with a similar issue? how should i proceed? could i get a refund??

"driver drove to our complex, took a picture of a different apartment, marked as complete but never picked up the food. we ordered ubereats from a restaurant the next town over, pretty quickly we were assigned a driver. he had a nice story about how he loves this job cause he can balance his life and kids, it said he had 982 deliveries. i thought, oh what a nice man. i was deceived by the lies. 

the next time we look at the app it says the food was arriving early and was on its way. great, i'm starving! that's great timing there must be no traffic. then in no time, the app shows he's arriving. my boyfriend peaks out the window, huh that's weird i don't see a car or anything. seconds later we get the notification that the food has arrived. we look at the picture and it's just a picture of the room number sign it the apartment building a few away from ours. there's no food in the picture, just the wrong door. my bf goes out side to that building, nothing is there at all. that's weird, lets call him….
immediately went to voicemail, try again…same thing. 

a few minutes later we get a call from the owner of the restaurant. “hey your food was never picked up im trying to close up.”
the owner was really nice we agreed to pick it up ourselves and he would leave it hidden there. 

of course while this is happening we get a charge for the tip. i surely don't want to tip this man. we got the refund from the “my food never showed up” button. but we still paid the tip. after the surprise excursion to the restaurant, i went through the report a problem tab and explained the situation. they asked for proof which is hard to prove we literally just took a pic of the call log showing the restaurant reaching out to us. i don't know what else to do 

.what other motivation could he have for doing this? he literally drove here just to claim the money, that's wild to me. has anyone had a similar situation happen? is there anything else i should do?

"why is uber one so hard to cancel? i've seen a lot of these posts on the subreddit but many of the ways to cancel uber one that i've read online are no longer available. 

the ""end membership"" button under the ""manage membership"" tab has been removed. and the ""chat"" at the bottom of the help tab is also gone. there's is no phone number provided for customer service. after digging through the uber website i found a tab to send messages to uber and after telling them i wanted to cancel my membership they replied saying they successfully canceled my membership. i checked the app and to my suprise my membership wasn't cancelled. i know this because if it were actually cancelled it would show me an option to renew the membership. i told support they didn't  cancel anything but they just sent the same message saying they did(pretty i was talking to an ai chat bot). sent another message a week later asking if my membership was canceled and they said it was still active. i asked them to cancel it again and finally it appears that it's actually canceled. its kinda gross how they lure in people with free trials and then make the process to cancel it so difficult. i didn't even end up ordering any food. btw here's the link to the chat with anyone trying to cancel. for some reason the link is under the ""verify identity"" tab.

"a brash message for customer support i’ve been with uber eats for years and before that, skip the dishes for years. loyal to each for say 5 years each, respectively. i spend thousands per year, simply because i’m lazy and don’t enjoy cooking. whenever there has been an issue with my meal, whether missing items, late or cold, both companies operate the same: compensate the customer, but with the bare minimum. the bare minimum being, just fix the problem they caused in the first place, but offer no ‘punitive damages’, so to speak. in other words, don’t refund more than you have to because we don’t care about the customers time or dining experience. 

i ordered some chicken wings and they forgot the ranch dip. i paid for it but it was missing. now anybody who’s a wing connoisseur knows ranch is the bread and butter of the meal. it’s the straw that stirs the drink. ranch is an integral part of eating chicken wings. it’s the ‘experience’. i contact the delivery driver through uber and notify him. he tells me the restaurant is really far, so call uber first and if they don’t help, he will go back. uber doesn’t help. they refund the $2 for a mistake they’re responsible for. technically it’s the restaurants fault, yes, but nonetheless, uber can work out the semantics on a $2 cup of ranch dressing with them. problem is now i can’t call the driver back, because i don’t have his direct number. it connected me through the app, and that option was no longer available. i contact support again. they escalate it. i spoke to 3 different people and they all said the same thing: $2. my experience meant nothing. i threatened to switch to skip the dishes. $2. 

ok, fine. i get it. i’m just a number to them. they don’t care about my business, so i’ll go…but not before i bid them adieu with a snarky message. here is that message:

‘you guys are dumb. like really dumb. you don’t care because you’re minimum wage workers. escalate this problem to any top manager or business owner and they would not just refund the entire meal, they would fire your dumb asses for not listening to a loyal customer. any business owner or smart businessman knows the customers are the lifeblood of his company. even if the company is so large he can ‘afford’ to lose their business. because he knows if that customer leaves, maybe he tells 10 other customers. and they tell other people. smart business is refunding my entire order. dumb business is what you’re doing. refunding a measly $2 for your mistake in the first place. but that’s why you’re in the minimum wage position and not a business owner. you’re simply not smart enough. idiots.’

"priority ordering is a scam if there's anyone else figured this out?

i pick my food and then do priority order. 

it used to be that this meant getting my food hot and always under a certain time. but i started to notice it would be coming later and later no matter what. 

and a few times i've got to see where the driver was before they picked up my order. 

i've noticed a few times that they will be stopped at another restaurant close by sitting there. and then after a while they come and go pick up my order and then come and deliver that to me.

what this means is that my order has been sitting there cold for this extra time waiting to be picked up. 

i've even asked a few drivers and they say yes i picked up another order before yours. 

so the whole thing went from someone picking up your order and bringing it directly to you. from there it went to picking up another order and then coming to you. then they made you pay extra to have the order delivered straight to you first again. and now they're double dipping again by picking up an order before you .

like if he would've done it the way he was supposed to do it my food wouldn't have been sitting there for 30 minutes cold. but they push for more and more money out of these drivers and in the end we as customer suffer with cold food. 

well, i get the cold food, but i always just say my order didn't show up or it was the wrong order and i get my money back. i'll keep doing that every single time that i see them do this. 

like i've tried to talk to customer service and no one cares. so because they won't fix this and they want to remain cheap, i'll just continue getting my food for free..",2025-03-11 17:21:33,2,2,Reddit,UberEats

guys they are playing games with us as customers. the only way to get to customer support in the uber eats app is to lie about a past order being an issue so that you can get help with your current issue that isn’t order related. after you lie it will finally take you to chats. that is ridiculous!!! there should be a chat button that takes me there automatically!! not hidden behind 10 mountains of bs before we get to the promised land.

(edit 2: i’m getting just a small group of people who are saying the number is giving them an automated message. i’m going to explain why and what to do to circumvent this 👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇

why its happening: 

1.) your account/ phone number may be flagged 
2.) if you use a voip or possible prepaid number
3.) your phone numbers history/ region 
4.) you’ve called uber eats too much in the past so they are limiting you to chats 
5.) you could also be limited to chats because of lack of/ low order frequency

what to do: 

1.) call again with a different phone than the one you use for orders. 
2.) when you make it through tell them you aren’t calling about the number you’re speaking from but the phone number that you use for orders 💗 

this workaround i came up with has helped a lot of people so i just want to edit the post for any others who come accross it in the future! ☮️🫶

"driver demanding higher tip my wife ordered some food today, while i’m at work. the restaurant is right outside the gates of an air force installation (usa) and the driver went on base for some reason to get a visitors pass. they’re demanding that my wife tips more for having to go on base or they won’t deliver the food; but the restaurant isn’t on base and i’m not sure why they went on base in the first place. 

if something like this happens, what should she do? she’s pregnant and hungry so she told the driver she’d give them cash when they get to her but it doesn’t sit right with me, so just want to know for the future. 

edit: just to clarify, since a lot of people seem to have misunderstood (or didn’t read), the driver was demanding more for the tip because they “had to wait for a visitors pass for the military installation.” however, the restaurant isn’t not on base - it’s located in a strip mall outside of the gates. while my wife told them this, they ignored it and continued waiting for the visitors pass. there was never a need for them to go on base, nor to wait for a visitors pass when the restaurant isn’t on base.

"title: scammed on uber eats – restaurant never delivered my order, but uber confirmed it hey everyone,

i recently had a very frustrating experience with uber eats, and i’m hoping to get some advice from others who might have had similar issues.

on **march 11th**, i placed two orders:

1. the first order was from **first store** in arlington. i ordered at **11:55 pm** on **march 10th**, but after a long delay with no updates, i contacted uber support. they told me to cancel the order because i would get a full refund. i waited and waited, and finally, at **1:31 am** on march 11th, i decided to cancel. however, even after the cancellation, i received a text message at **5:42 am** confirming that the order was delivered, with a photo of a door from google (not my door) as proof of delivery. it was clear that the food never arrived.
2. i decided to try again, this time ordering from the **second store** at **2:00 am** on march 11th. i waited until **4:00 am**, but still no update. i tried calling the restaurant, but when i looked at my phone, i noticed that the number listed for **first store** was the same as the one i had called for **second store** earlier — despite the two restaurants being **12 miles apart**. i tried calling several times but got no response.

i reached out to uber support, and they told me **not to cancel** the order because i wouldn't get a full refund. so i waited, but around **5:00 am**, i received a text saying that my order was ""delivered"" — the same delivery person’s name was listed, and the photo attached was of a different location.

this is where things don’t add up:

* **both orders** were supposedly delivered by the **same person**.
* **the photos were different** (one from the turkish delight order and another from the lebanese delites order), but the delivery person was the same.
* **both restaurants had the same phone number**, yet they are located 12 miles apart.

how can this be? i have the delivery pictures showing they are not from my location, and i know i was scammed.

has anyone else experienced something similar on uber eats?

here are some questions i have:

* what should i do in this situation?
* how is uber allowing scams like this to happen?
* are fraudulent restaurants or delivery scams becoming more common on uber eats?
* has anyone else dealt with bogus restaurants or orders on uber eats?

"attn drivers + customers - how to contact a human for uber support every time you ask for help in the app or on the website, the first thing you get is an ai answering chat bot.

typically, that chatbot will ask you a list of issues, with the final one being **""something else""**... 

if you choose anything but ""something else"" - even if your issue is listed... you will only ever get the ai chatbot to repeat your chats back to you and tell you you did something wrong.

if you **choose ""something else"" 2-3 times**, you will be allowed to enter your own messages.

enter the following 2 times:

**""please connect me to a human agent.""**

the ai chatbot will offer 3 options:

**chat** (text) with an agent. / **call** an agent on the phone. / **leave** a message.

select **""call an agent.""**

you will then be given an access phone number and can speak to a human being.

this is the only way to get your issue fixed properly. the ai chatbot is designed to deflect, decline, deny, and dismiss you without a solution. 

speak to a human agent via phone call to get a real solution.

if the agent tells you something incorrect, correct them. ask to speak to a supervisor.

there's also no need to get angry or shout at them. these agents are overseas, have no direct connection whatsoever to whatever issue you have called about, but can provide services and options the ai chatbot is designed to deny in every instance possible.",2025-03-10 19:47:31,1,1,Reddit,UberEats

"$90 order delivered to the wrong address.  not eligible for a refund. i'm now realizing there are multiple stories on here of similar issues.  i just don't understand how uber eats can get away with essentially defrauding their customers.

i placed an order on saturday night.  the delivery address was correct.  i even took the time to fill out the additional delivery instructions so it would be easier for the driver even though it really wasn't necessary as my front door is about 10 feet from the road.  30 minutes later i receive the message that my order has been delivered along with a photo of the wrong house with the wrong house number clearly visible right above my bag of food.  i immediately tried calling the driver, he never answered.  i tried sending him a text message, again no reply so finally after a third attempt to contact the driver i used the ""get help"" option in the app where i explained that i had never received my food and that the driver had delivered it to the wrong address.  i assumed this would be an open and shut case as the picture clearly showed a house number that didn't match up with the delivery address and upon looking at the map it was delivered about 15 minutes across town nowhere near my home.  i figured ""oh well.  i guess i'm cooking tonight and uber eats will just have to refund me"".

imagine my surprise when i received the ""this order is not eligible for a refund"" email the next day.  i tried replying to the email but instead received a message back from uber eats saying i was using a different email address than the original message so it couldn't be received.  which is odd since i replied to that very email they sent me using the same email they sent it to.  so i ended up calling instacart since i ordered through their app.  they were able to give me the customer service phone number for uber eats.  the person i spoke with told me ""oh this is still under review but i see that your order was delivered to the wrong address and you didn't receive it.  i'm going to escalate this so it gets taken care of for you"".   so i figured the email was a mistake and i would receive an email with my refund details in a little while.  less than 5 minutes later i received the same email stating my order wasn't ""eligible for a refund"" again with no explanation as to why this is.  my third attempt at getting this resolved was to message them on facebook.  again after a back and forth with them agreeing with me that ""yes it was delivered to the wrong address"" and ""yes it's clearly showing the wrong address in the delivery photo"" they still refuse to refund.

i informed them that if they can't refund my order my only recourse would be to dispute the charges with my bank as i was being charged for services that weren't rendered to me.  their response was to copy and paste the same message back again except this time with a threat tacked on the end claiming that disputing the charges would be considered ""abuse"" of their system and that my account could be deactivated.

frankly i had already decided i was never going to use their services again anyway so they can go ahead and deactivate my account.   i informed them that indeed i will be disputing the charges with my bank as well as submitting a formal complaint with the bbb and that i had documented all conversations and emails including the multiple admissions by uber eats that they had indeed delivered my food to the wrong address and would be submitting those documents as proof that my dispute is valid.

this time they responded claiming ""the delivery partner followed the guidelines on delivering your order so we cant issue a refund"".  i would assume a very important ""guideline"" would be to deliver to the correct address but apparently according to uber eats i'm wrong to assume this.

then of course they sent the ""tell us how we did by filling out this survey"" message.

so yeah.  once my bank opens in the morning i will dispute the charges and i will submit my complaint with the bbb.  i'm a business owner myself and if i ever took a customers money and then didn't provide them services or a refund i would be held accountable and face legal actions for not providing that service.  so how does uber eats get a pass and how much money have they essentially stolen from their customers who have been in similar situations as myself?

this has seriously been a horrific experience and the uber eats customer support has been useless.

\*\*update\*\* 3-11-25

i ended up filing a complaint with the bbb.  i'll wait to hear from them to see if they can get my refund before disputing with my bank.  if uber still refuses or doesn't respond to the bbb i will dispute the charges with my bank.

\*\*update\*\* 3-14-25

uber responded to the bbb.  again refusing to refund.  called my bank and disputed the charge and received my refund that way.  uber eats can go eff themselves.  i appreciate all the support and kind comments.  i think we all knew it would most likely end this way.",2025-03-10 18:43:31,30,35,Reddit,UberEats

"messed up orders should refund delivery fee or its a net loss for customer. whenever i get mcdonalds it takes forever, and they always miss an item. you can get a quick refund on it but its still a net loss for you since delivery fee and tip is huge (even with uber one).

its like okay my total order was $50 from a mexican place. they forget the tacos and get a $16 refund. that doesnt even count if i re order something else and end up paying double now for the next.

just like how every store is running apps for points to get you a small ""free"" item in hopes you order more with it lol.",2025-03-08 23:30:35,2,5,Reddit,UberEats

"priority order mishap i ordered a priority food order that was supposed to arrive in less than half an hour. an hour later, it wasn’t even assigned to a driver. i went on chat and after several attempts with a bot, i was able to chat with a live person. i told him to cancel the order, and he said he would have to direct me to someone else. 

he then closed the chat and the next automated message was that someone would contact me within six to twelve hours, which was absolutely unacceptable. 

i would still be charged if i were to cancel the order, but it was going on an hour and a half and a driver was still not assigned to pick up the order. as it was a dinner order and i didn’t want it to turn into a breakfast order, i canceled it and figured i would be reimbursed when the chat representative contacted me. 

i was contacted the next day but it was to no avail.  it seemed like it was a bot response, because i would get the same automated message every time. i even included photos as evidence. 

so now i’m out money and don’t know what else to do. infuriating that they don’t have a customer service phone number!",2025-03-08 20:58:01,2,7,Reddit,UberEats

"please tip your drivers hi there,

ubereats delivery driver here. we receive alot of orders a day because uber also owns postmates and does the walmart delivery orders. i personally have noticed an increase in customers in my area not tipping anything. not even $1. i understand times are hard that's personally why i do deliveries in my free time for extra cash. however please think about the people working to complete your order. uber pays $1.50 to $2 per delivery. that's it. we heavily rely on tips. so if you have a car load of groceries from walmart and give no money and uber gives us $3 for a 10 mile trip, please be aware your delivery is not going to get done. nobody will accept that. it is a good rule of thumb to review the miles and tip according to that. $1 per mile should be the minimum unless you're being extremely generous. 

i've also come across the not so honest customer where after texting and delivering with pictures for the support team i'm told i didn't deliver the order. do you realize when you do this you out drivers at risk of deactivation? this is our livelihood. please, be kind . don't be a lying stealing theif trying to get others in trouble for no reason. always communicate with your driver. some like myself are more responsive because we're just tech savvy but others there may be a language barrier.

decide to just move on. couple hours later get a call from a 415 while i’m on another delivery and it’s an indian accent asking me if i have the bottle of whiskey? wants me to deliver to the bottle if he gives me the address over the phone. tell him i will deliver it, even though it’s out of my way, but want him to add the delivery to my app. i don’t want to take down the address on the phone. how could i scan his id??? and i won’t get paid. he tells me if i don’t they’ll flag my account. i jumped in his ass after that telling him it was uber’s mistake with the app. he hung up on me. since then everything has been normal. got paid for that first delivery.

"what kind of person is this? i’ve been doing uber eats for a couple years now and once in a while maybe 1 out of 500 deliveries i end up delivering to a real weirdo.
i want to know if i should be upset about this or if i’m in the wrong, and any comments are appreciated. so i picked up a semi normal delivery 8.5 miles for 12$, this person ordered 2 bean and cheese burritos, so i know order was correct because there were 2 burritos in the bag and i made sure to add extra sauce, took me about 3 minutes from accepting it to get to the restaurant but in those 3 minutes she was on me, asking for extra sauce, i’m like ok sure, then 30 seconds later asked me if i’m on the way, and how long till you are at the restaurant?, a total of 3 msgs. then after i get her order i’m driving straight to her but i stopped at a gas station on the way for 5 minutes tops, and right away 30 seconds after i stop she msgs me again “it shows you stopped” “why does it show you stopped?”when are u coming, i replied maybe 1 minute later telling her i’m 5 minutes away. 4 msgs in those 5 minutes while  i was filling up. then i went straight to her. the whole 8.5 mile delivery took me 27 minutes to make, food was still warm because i left right after they packed it up it was about 10pm at night. besides the 5 minute stop i believe it was a perfect delivery. anyways she gave me a dissatisfaction rating cause i saw it go down after her delivery and she also took her 4.5$ tip away. obviously i will avoid delivering to this person, and if i accidentally pick up an order meant for her i still won’t deliver to her. but what kind of person just stares at their phone the whole 27 minutes of the delivery? and during time jars spams driver with msgs? was she right to give me a thumbs down and tip bait for a 5 minute gas station stop, even though 8.5 mile delivery took me a total of 27 minutes which i feel like is very reasonable. order was very simple so i’m sure it was all there. what are you thoughts?",2025-03-08 02:36:18,0,7,Reddit,UberEats

"it's my first week as a driver, any tips if i'm doing this right? i've read through several ""any tips for a new driver' posts here, but the search function in reddit isn't the best. i know the most popular response is ""get out while you can"" but i'm not looking to do this full-time. it's just to help me out while i'm in between jobs and i value the responses from other drivers here.

  
in my first week i tried the 'opportunity' hourly rate pay which has been between $15-$17/hr. **i'm just north of miami and about 15 min from a major airport so i'm in a populated area.** *it sucked.* i later read here that it's a scam, and when you choose that option you get sent all the deliveries no one else wanted. right now i have only delivered between 8pm-2am for about 2-4 hours a night to test things out (mainly using the opportunity pay). i've made about $25-$35 a night (including tips). i didn't calculate my miles but i'm sure i drove way more then i should have. i noticed that during dinner time i got more orders that paid better and were in a shorter distance.

i recently got approved for shopping and also alcohol delivery but have not tried any of those orders yet.

i tried playing the system a little. my home area and the surrounding area are always either $$$ or $$$$ except for very odd times (like 4am). i've been trying to stay in the $$$$ areas at all times and always head back to the nearest orange food hot spot in the $$$$ area hoping it will get me a high paying order faster. i think it's working but i'm still too new at this to have enough experience.

so far people have mentioned i should calculate my orders to be $2/mi and not be afraid to cherry pick orders. i am going to test that next and bail on using the opportunity pay.

here are some of my questions: 

1. does my acceptance rate actually have an effect on the amount and type of orders i get?
2. should i be returning to those orange food hot spots after each order?
3. are there any types of deliveries i should be avoiding or taking?
4. how do you know the full mileage an order will be from where i am, to pick up, to drop off?

  
any other tips or links to suggested videos or posts would be greatly appreciated too. right now i see this as a game, and would like to play it the best i can so i can maximize my use of time and minimize the wear on my car and gas.",2025-03-08 00:54:17,2,7,Reddit,UberEats

"successfully disputed phantom order with citi credit card i know that this issue is common, but i thought to let you all know that i got a credit for a fake/phantom order by disputing it with my credit card (citi).  here is what happened:  

i had items in my cart, and exited the app and locked my phone (i could have remained in the app and locked my phone as well, not 100% certain).  when i went back into the app, the items that had been in my cart were ordered and a delivery was on its way and couldn't be cancelled.  the first time this happened, i decided to just keep the order and thought it was my fault.  however, it happened again a week later, and the address where it was being delivered was to a hotel nearby where i had stayed a year ago.  so i was forced to cancel and i only got back part of the total amount.  i called ubereats and complained, but of course they didn't do anything to help me.  so i disputed the amount with my credit card company.  they actually opened up an investigation and requested proof from ubereats.  they apparently did send them ""proof"" because i got an email stating that citi had received a response and that they were reviewing the details.  however today, i got confirmation that they resolved the issue in my favor and issued a credit for the full amount.

whenever you get screwed by ubereats, dispute the charge.  credit card companies are likely receiving thousands of similar complaints and are seeing in real time that uber does jack to help make customers whole if they didn't receive their order or (as with me) flat out didn't authorize a charge.  credit card companies tend to be more favorable/supportive of the consumer in these cases and would rather rule in their favor.",2025-03-07 16:44:45,1,11,Reddit,UberEats

"f sams club (smh) today was the very first time i received multiple offers to pick up ""single"" deliveries at sam's club.

i rejected the first 6 of them... all of them were single deliveries traveling 8-22 miles for a grand total offer of $2.04 - $2.53 each.

then i got a nice one that was reasonable: a single pickup and single drop off for $12 going only 9 miles.

when i arrived to check in at the pickup parking spot, i scrolled down and swear every driver in their closed vehicle on either side of me must have heard my full-volume...

# what the f__k!?!?!

that $12 offer was literally every single offer i had rejected: 6 customers, each with ""1 item""... ...

remembering the distances and directions of travel for all 6, i knew they were literally all over the gd place. a minimum of 2-3 hours of driving in a big circle around the sam's club center.

i swear to all that anyone believes in that when i accepted this $12 offer, it said a single customer, a single delivery that would only take 28 mins to drop off... .... and no, i did not take screenshots, sorry. not sorry.

stunned and unsure what to do next, i sat there... waiting... and waiting... wondering what next... eventually, i noticed literally 25 mins had passed since i checked in... ...

no employee coming out with the 6 orders.

so i said f\_\_k it and cancelled all 6 deliveries.

my cancellation rate went from 1% to 8% instantly, since i have not had that many orders yet this month/week.

i cannot imagine how anyone in their right mind would or could accept legitimately all these ""single"" orders - both the $2 per 8-22 miles ones as well as the surprise bundled ones that literally show that they are 1 drop off when they're more than that.

"opinion: uber should make a feature to prevent someone getting food from being part of a multi-order. i feel like i need to rant about this.
this morning, i ordered tropical smoothie on uber eats.
it tells me the driver is doing multiple orders but will be at my house by 9:00 am to 9:20 am.
i’m watching the gps so i can meet the driver outside so they can move on faster.
i see the guy is going around and around in circles on the order before me. eventually, he completely disappears from the map but it does not say that it’s delivered. i try to reboot the app to see if it’s a malfunction but it’s still showing the same thing.
i try reaching out to the guy and he picks up on the second call. he thinks i’m his first order and i repeatedly tell him that i’m the second one. he pretty much tells me he’s lost on the first order.
if you’re lost, why are you not calling the first order to find out where they are? instead, you are sacrificing my order.
i got so frustrated that i contacted support and cancelled the order with a full refund.
i hate it that this always seems to happen with me on uber eats. i’m always the last stop on a multi stop order and my food is disgusting most of the time.
i wish uber would create a feature where the person who is receiving the food can choose to not be part of a multi-stop delivery. but it’s only for the drivers.

edit: for those calling me lazy, i don’t do uber eats a lot. i did it this time because i was working and didn’t have time to leave. i normally don’t like these apps because they charge so much more. it’s easier to go to the store. i only use it in exceptions. this was more of a vent post",2025-03-06 12:31:59,15,88,Reddit,UberEats

i rang the door bell and then knocked, yet no one ever came to the door. the customer already paid so i was waiting figuring out how to tell them i spilled the drinks (i hate doing that because i feel so stupid that i ruined their meal).

then after some time it occurs to me maybe they aren't coming to the door fast so i will just prepare everything (5 bags) and started taking it out and placing it by their door.

then i waited.. and decided to book it outta there.

i left quickly and marked order as complete. of course i feel even more stupid that i didn't try harder contact.. but i like to pretend i was about to sh!t myself and had to get outta there quick.

"ubereats driver being suspicious or am i overly paranoid? hello, i normally don't ever post at all but i wanted to ask any fellow ubereats users or maybe drivers if they've had a similar experience to give the benefit of the doubt. i had an appointment to go pick up my mom early this morning but wanted to grab food. i went and ordered krystals because thats what i was craving, but the closest one is about 15 minutes away from my house by car, so uber said it would take around 40 minutes for my food to get here. i was chill with that, and just used the priority button and paid extra so my food was first that way it would get here before i needed to go pick up my mom, so it got knocked down to about 33 minutes. i was given this one driver who at first was fine, nothing out of the ordinary, until he missed 3 exits and started driving into a different city. he also kept stopping on the sides of roads and not moving. it was getting closer to the time, so i asked him 'are you here?' because it was the prebuilt message and i don't really like texting people while theyre driving. then his car stopped, and it stopped for a while. almost 10 minutes later i asked him 'where are you' because at this point he was still in the other city all the way past my house thats over 20 minutes away. he responds a minute later and says that hes coming and he had to get gas because his gas ran out. that was odd to me because he would have had to pass 4 different gas stations in order to get to the one all the way up there but i said oh ok and he responds that he's on his way. then i see his car move towards a gas station so i assume that maybe my uber map is not up to date, but from what it looked like he just reversed into it. i respond like three minutes later with 'alright' and wait for a bit before telling him that it shows he was at the gas station still for me on my screen, but think nothing of it because now i have to go pick up my mom to lend her the car. her house is 15 minutes away from my house, aka where i had the drop off point for the food. once i get there, i check the map and it shows that we passed each other, but that he is on the way to my house. while i'm on the way back to my house, it shows that he still had not dropped off the food, which i thought was weird because he should have been there by now, but instead i watch the screen and he starts doing literal laps around my neighborhood and going into random surrounding parking lots and sitting in them for a minute then continuing. i'm about 3 minutes away from the house so i texted him 'are you lost?' and 'its been almost 2 hours of you driving with my food, did something happen after you went to go get gas?' because now i am starting to think that maybe he just wants me to cancel the order so he can get free food. however, when i'm driving up to my neighborhood, i see his car that is sitting in this corner area that is not supposed to be driven in and he does a crazy u-turn to the point where it kicks up dust, and speed into my neighborhood. so while i'm driving, he keeps pulling to the side and my mom and i end up sitting in front of the house waiting for him to drop the food off. (my mom is actually the one driving me back home since she needs to lend the car, and when i told her about it after i picked her up she took me to a coffee shop nearby that had basically the same thing i had ordered from krystals). my mom pretends to be a delivery driver and takes the food we just got to the front door and takes a picture of it and waits to see if he would do the same, and he does. he takes a picture of the food from inside the car and leaves it at the door. then when i finally go inside he waits outside of my house for almost 15 minutes. i reversed the tip and my mom told me not to eat the food because she says he could have tampered with it, and when i opened the bag the food i ordered was opened and i can't tell if i am looking at spit or just grease and that the stress is making me overthink everything. i would post pictures but all the screenshots i have show his name, car model, and plate numbers along with the area i stay in because i have several screenshots of him circling around the neighborhood. can anyone think of any reasons this could have been happening or maybe a similar story and advice on what i should do? since he was travelling so far i originally tipped him $10 and the order total was $34 and some change but i ended up taking the tip away.",2025-03-06 10:05:37,0,8,Reddit,UberEats

"using this app is a bit useless, considering the way they treat customers yesterday i've ordered 2 big meals from a local greek restaurant, then the driver calls me to say that ""he is outside"" but i've told him the number to which he responded.. ""i dont know where that is.. are you coming down or should i leave the food here?""

where? in the parking lot i wonder? but i just came down quickly to make sure i can get it and forget about the entire thing. (he was not a regular driver but a restaurant's courier)

what happened next - i noticed the order is wrong - i call the resturant and i tell them about it, they said that they can replace the order but after the ""rude"" delivery driver i didnt want it, i also have a health issue so i wanted him to meet me at my door if he couldnt be nice enough to meet me at the door then i didnt want the same situation again.

so they agreed to refund me, however they said it has to go through the app otherwise it will mess with their till. uber eats has declined the refund immediately due to abuse by many customers.

the restaurant said that they have supposedly in the meantime called the support and supposedly support should contact me via app - but nothing is here, nothing on the email either. why would they want to contact me anyway? if restaurant already made a statement of what is missing, why do they need to talk to me?

i said there is nothing, and if they can contact the uber eats again and ask if the support can just call me?

and the restaurant said they will but never called me back, obviously the uber eats have never contacted me either. i think the restaurant just lied to me.

so my experience is negative, the driver wasnt very nice to me, but its ok, restaurant didnt do what they were supposed to do, and uber eats doesnt even allow a single way to make things right in case something goes wrong - at this point, whats even the point of using this overpriced app? i think it was the last nail to the coffin, and i will delete the app and stop supporting it.

do you have any advice on what should i do in this case other than ignoring it?",2025-03-05 06:18:09,4,3,Reddit,UberEats
"cheap orders method (very effective) some people might know this and it'll probably be taken care of, but these prices are actually just insane and i want to teach you guys my method.

everytime you create a new account with a new email there's first time offers sent to you, but they not very good deals, and they are relating to uber one and savings, but i've seen that every 10 days after a new account is created without having placed an order you're sent promotion that says 25$ off, 1$ minimum and that's for 2 first orders on the account. create multiple emails and accounts and you have unlimited severely discounted meals ready for delivery that's takes 10 days in preparation every time.

"uber eats merchant sign-up is an absolute nightmare i just had the most frustrating experience trying to sign up my bakery for uber eats, and i need to vent. the process is an absolute mess—disorganized, slow, and borderline impossible to complete without losing your mind.

first off, the application process is unclear. you submit your business info, and then… nothing. no confirmation, no estimated timeline, just silence. days go by, and suddenly you might get an email asking you to call a number to finish the sign up process. 

then comes the communication black hole. if you have any questions or issues, good luck getting a human response. the support system is mostly automated, and when you do get a rep, they often give vague or contradictory answers. i’ve been bounced around between departments, each one acting like it’s someone else’s problem.

the worst part? the waiting game. even after everything is “approved,” your store might sit in limbo for weeks with no explanation. you’re stuck refreshing your inbox hoping for an update.

"uber: from $8.1b ipo to assault accusations, and 20% stock drop — was it overhyped? hey everyone, any $uber investors here? if you followed uber’s early days as a public company, you probably remember the financial struggles and controversies it faced right after its ipo. if not, here’s a recap of what happened—and the latest updates.

[uber went public on may 9, 2019](https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/10/18564197/uber-ipo-stock-valuation-pricing-fares-drivers-public-market), raising over $8.1b. however, just three months later, [the company reported a $5.24b loss for q2 2019](https://investor.uber.com/news-events/news/press-release-details/2019/uber-reports-second-quarter-2019-results/default.aspx). even after adjusting for expenses, uber still posted a $1.3b net loss, with slower-than-expected revenue growth. following this news, $uber dropped by over 20%.

among the financial struggles, uber was accused of bypassing local regulations in key markets like india, latin america, china, and tanzania. this ""growth at any cost"" approach led to legal troubles and even arrests of employees in some regions.

and if this wasn’t enough, uber was also accused of ignoring major safety risks in the years leading up to its ipo. [reports showed](https://abcnews.go.com/business/uber-reveals-6000-incidents-sexual-assaults-safety-report/story?id=67538499) that between 2017 and 2019, there were nearly 3,000 sexual assaults, 107 crash-related deaths, and 19 fatal assaults involving uber rides in the u.s. alone. these revelations raised questions about whether uber had properly disclosed these risks to investors before going public.

after all this, investors sued uber in late 2019, and now uber finally agreed to pay $200m to settle the case. so, if you held $uber stock back then, you might be eligible to [file a claim](https://11thestate.com/cases/uber-investor-settlement) and recover some of your losses.

anyways, do you think uber has fully turned things around since its rocky ipo, or are there still hidden risks?",2025-03-04 09:18:30,0,14,Reddit,UberEats

i am new to driving uber eats.

a few days ago, i had an order 20 blocks away so i went there and when i arrived to pick up, they said someone has already picked it up so i cancelled it.

another order right after that came in and when i went there like 3 blocks away, the restaurant was closed so that i had to cancel it too.

the fares were around $13 and $35 for two orders.

now, i didn't get any compensation even after reporting it and contacting to support.

the support chat transferred me to a lot of different teams and none of them agreed to offer me compensation. they basically said my time and driving is not accepted by their compensation policy.

naturally i don't remember the order ids when they ask me and i don't remember most of the details since i wasn't expecting to be this required to ask for compensation. this seemed to have set them off and coincidentally, these two orders were off the record and history in the app so no evidence is to be found.

"can we talk about uber eats support? the support from ubereats has become a joke. i can't imagine a multinational company like uber having non-existent support. if a driver does not deliver food, you still get charged. if you cancel your uber one subscription, you still get charged. if you are missing half your order, you still get charged. there is absolutely no way whatsoever of contacting them. moreover, they don't care, there are no repercussions, nothing. how can an international company operate like this? i find it hard to comprehend.

already cancelled my uber one subscription. they still charge me everyday. tried reaching them on x. the support rep simply closes the ticket asking for a rating. what rating? no support line, nothing...",2025-03-03 00:20:57,1,2,Reddit,UberEats

"terrible customer service this is my first time using uber eats and i’ve been greeted with the worst customer treatment. as a gift somebody gave me an uber eats gift card so i create an account. thus that friend also tells me that he has a referral promotion code he can give me for $20 off. i try to use the promotion but it just keeps getting rejected to the point where i use there text chat support. i tell them my issue kindly at first and they give me no real responses and keep transferring me to the next representative. it gets to a point where they say wait 6-12 hours for a response. i go to bed and wake up to reply, no response or sign of help. i start a new support claim and i explain my issue to the lady and she says since i started one already she sees no point in continuing the conversation and just ends it. i go on about my day for a while then i reach back out and i talk to another representative. at this point this is like the 6th person i’ve talked to in the past 24 hours so i’m a little irritated but still trying to assure them that i’m not frustrated at them but instead just trying to figure out the issue. i then get transferred to another representative and i can quite literally say this is one of the rudest people i’ve talked to and for no reason at all. she comes at me saying that uber reserves all rights to deny any promotion codes no matter the circumstance. i tell her that’s a little weird but why’d i get mine denied. she says that i’ve broken the terms of service and when i ask what did i break she says i can still order food from the app. i again ask what service did i break nicely. she claims that there’s no way for her to accommodate me for the issue and before i could even respond she ends the conversation. just very rude tone from her overall. i then go back to text back the customer support help line and i get connected and tell them my issue again, provide asked for screenshots and everything they asked for. they tell me uber has now banned my account from any and all promotions. when i ask is there any way i can refund the gifted uber cash or receive compensation for the promotion code they just decided not to use i got told that i’ve already been provided the best option and there’s no point to continue our conversation and it ended right there. i just want to know what the hell i did wrong and why i just hoed for over a day now for no reason. i wouldn’t even be tripping like this if i wasn’t promised the promotion in the first place by uber. moral of the story no longer using uber, i don’t recommend it, and stay safe god bless.",2025-03-02 21:25:26,2,2,Reddit,UberEats

i ordered from uber eats last night, i think the order total was £14.75 the resturant (burger king) is exactly 2 miles away, it was prime time saturday night at 8pm two drivers cancelled on me in a row after accepting the order then i didn't want to wait any longer for a 3rd driver so i cancelled my order and was charged £14.75 however i was refunded only £3.75.

should i receive the full amount as a refund or not? i understand operational costs and food preparation with it been a prime time saturday night 8pm slot i am very sure that the drivers cancelled and got a better offer from uber or a different driving app.

the food could be cold? the resturant would have to remake the food,

why should two drivers cancel the order after accepting the food order and not receive penalties? why should the customer be at fault? and what about the resturant unable to find a driver?

i thought, surely one of those other drivers had attempted to contact the customer. maybe she wouldnt respond, which is why this order keeps getting passed around. i stepped outside and called the customer. she answered first try. said she was fine with a substitution and told me which she wanted. none of the other drivers even tried to call her. for the time and effort of a 2 minute phone call, i was able to complete this order for a nice pay.",2025-02-28 20:39:19,5,6,Reddit,UberEats

"direct orders not being received hi all, 

in the last couple of weeks there has been an issue in the area i deliver in where some of the drivers, including myself, no longer receive direct orders. 

an example of this would be from tesco where the customer has to use the merchants app to place the order then it comes through to uber. 

so far at least 6 people i know of are experiencing the same issue and it's impacting the earning potential greatly. 

have tried contacting uber support and they spit out useless nonsense saying there is nothing wrong with my account (same response to others) and try a different location. 

there aren't that many merchants in my area to use uber so it's noticeable when you don't receive orders and others are. it isn't due to being too quiet either. they have just simply stopped sending anything direct such as tesco, mcdonald's, coop and asda. 

has anyone else been experiencing this issue and if so have you had it resolved in any way?

"how i feel about tipping in 2025 i've heard every argument and i've probably made them all too...   
restaurants should pay better. yadda yadda yadda... but the truth is,

the bottom line is, i am grateful for people bringing me food, and am amazed

at how in this day and age i can order something pretty much any time of the day or night.

i grew up at a time where the only food delivery was pizza, and it wasn't very good either.

i tip 20%, and sometimes if the driver is especially amazing i'll tip more. i have on occasion 

tipped less if they put the food right in front of my door so i cannot even open my door to get it without

spilling it over, or if they forgot a major item, which sadly seems to happen a lot.. for example, every single time i have ordered nuggets from a place in the last year, i never get the sauces, ever. 

i ordered a cheesecake from someplace with a meal, they didn't bring the cheesecake, i called the restaurant, they weren't out.  i often wonder if the driver just decided to eat it since they wouldn't be held accountable if they did, i'll be refunded anyway, right?

but, overall, i am grateful for my delivery drivers and i am a generous person, so i like to tip well.

after finally getting the second order, uber had me deliver it first.  this order was 5 miles away and in the opposite direction from the first order that had been sitting there getting cold for a half hour, and was only a mile away…   after delivering the second order, enroute to deliver the now cold and soggy order that was ready first, uber sent me several bids in which i would have driven even further out of the way to make the pick up, *prior* to making that second delivery.   imagine being that customer getting an indication i’m *finally* on my way, and then seeing the eta bump another twenty minutes and me no longer on my way to you…. i declined everything and got to the customer as quickly as possible.

after the dust had settled, the customer who’s order was ready over a half hour before the second order, was closer to the restaurant, and was forced to be the last delivery, was the one who tipped, and i only got a $2 total base from uber!!!

uber made that first tipping customer wait ridiculously long just so they could pay me zero to deliver to a non-tipping customer first, and then they repeatedly tried to make them wait even longer after the customer had been told i was omw to them.  absolute insanity, lol.

"uber customer support is basically gaslighting me. help me hi everyone,

i am at my wits end here. i am looking for advice on how to deal with this because i feel like i will never see my money again.

over a month ago, a friend of mine gave me a uber eats gift card, which i redeemed and was converted into what they call uber money.

i tried to order some food and it didn’t work, the payment method kept failing. that’s when i realized that most likely i needed to do an identity verification first by submitting my id card (i heard they have this measure to prevent money laundering. not sure if it’s true but we had looked online and this was recommended).

well i submitted the documents and it said i would hear within 48 hours. that never happened.

after a week, i reached out to their customer support and that’s when the whole ordeal started: messages upon messages of agents completely ignoring what i said, pretending to not know the case (i worked in cs  at a large corporation before before and i am pretty sure they can see all conversations to get the context they need), even when i took the time to explain everything all over again. 

 their messages were obviously just sent to postpone having to deal with my case, most likely cherry picking or just being lazy af. 

sometimes there were little steps forward, and eventually an agent told me that i needed to once again add my paypal to my uber account (which i had done already) as they need a backup payment method (keep in mind you also have to add it when ordering in case you don’t have enough credit and i had already done it a few times). this time i readded it to my actual account not just when completing the order. well that didn’t work. they said they would refund the uber money to my bank account, so i need to provide my iban number via a link that was shared and to share my bank statement to show i am the account holder. 

i did and i got a template answer that they needed 48 hours and would get back to me. it’s been over 10 days. i tried to reach out again of course but i could no longer use that chat (it has happened a few times already) so i had to open a new one. the next agent pretended they didn’t know what i was talking about although, again, they surely do have all the details there. anyways, i did explain in my message what i was waiting for and they still gave a random answer using a template. i explained again that i am awaiting a refund to my bank account and they came up with a stupid lie (that they tried to refund the “charge” to my bank account but they couldn’t so they refunded it in the form of uber credits… well there was no charge and what they needed to refund was the uber credits. this is how i knew they are just messing with me).

i have opened over 10 conversations at this point trying to get someone to help me because they keep either closing the chats or not responding to my messages. i have 60€ in uber money which i can’t use (this was a gift because i am newly postpartum and my friend wanted to make my meals easy to help me navigate this time.. so that’s even more infuriating). 

i really do not know what to do at this point. we’ve opened a claim through a european portal to protect consumers but we haven’t heard yet and the service is being discontinued this year so i am not sure they will do anything. i just want one single agent to take me seriously and do their job but they keep gaslighting me and sending standard replies. at this point basically uber stole my money.

is it worth to deliver in palm springs? i've been seeing on the app that supposedly people are constantly ordering day and night in palm springs compared to places like riverside that really only peak during lunch and dinner. despite being in cali all my life i actually don't know much about palm springs. i've heard that its actually quite the dead place but i wanted to check with anyone else here who might know about what its actually like there. i have college classes to pay off and i want to know if its actually worth it to deliver in palm springs or if i should just stay near riverside instead.,2025-02-27 03:30:59,0,1,Reddit,UberEats

"what do you do? when parked at a restaurant, not a shop and deliver, do you turn your car off or let it idle?

i have a stick shift so i'm not worried about theft 😆 so i keep it running. 

idk something in my mind tells me it's easier for the engine to keep it running than it starting and stopping every 30 minutes. 

i also know new cars have the stop start, but they were engineered for that. my delivery car i guarantee you isn't engineered for stop/start.

noticed a change. cancellations by uber when delayed once i was delayed getting to the pickup and once i was waiting a long time at the store. had the order canceled by uber and then re sent out. it’s so they don’t have to pay additional amount. so basically they’ll never pay more than the minimum now. if you’ve been told you have to wait i recommend canceling. otherwise you might wait 20 min and have them cancel and either send it back to you or another driver ,2025-02-26 21:24:55,0,2,Reddit,UberEats

he is on camera leaving with my order. uber eats is making me pay for this, saying that i gave him the pin number so whatever happens to the order is my fault
i give the drivers pin all the time, and i are sick and sometimes it’s more convenient this way the driver always takes a photo of it and it works out fine, but this guy didn’t.
if i did this at my job, i’d be fired for sure and i can’t even talk to anyone because they said they couldn’t do anything for me for the first few times i called and that someone would call me back and they were looking into the issue, but no one did  and then , the third day  they say because 48 hours has passed, i was  ineligible to resolve the issue !

"it’s time we boycott uber eats. most customers are tired of all the extra fees, tip expectations that are comparable to sit down service, and prices being higher than what they are at the restaurant

the drivers in many cases give attitude about giving you the food and rarely read the instructions you give. they also tend to be late- the food tends to come 45 minutes later or sometimes two hours later…so the food that you paid all this extra money for is damp and soggy. 

isn’t this a luxury service? nothing about this seems luxury to me aside from the high prices. 

and it’s not just the customers that hate it…the restaurants hate uber eats too for taking a big cut of their profits

"tired of the people who want everyone to know much they hate ubereats i've been lurking on this sub for a while and i've noticed a running theme from the comments under most posts. doesn't matter if you're a driver or a customer, there will always be at least one person saying some variation of, ""find a real job"" if you're a driver, or ""pick up the food yourself"" if you're a customer.

and im seriously wondering why tf these people are even here on the *ubereats* sub. they clearly hate the app and everyone who uses it yet they're under every other post

edit: to be crystal clear, i'm specifically talking about the customers/drivers who make valid complaints on this sub only to get indundated with pointless comments about how they should've never used/driven for uber eats in the first place

"uber support penalized me for a cancellation they caused – no resolution after multiple attempts hi fellow drivers,

i wanted to share my frustrating experience with uber support in the hope of getting some advice or shedding light on how they handle issues like this. here’s what happened:

• the incident :

• i arrived at the restaurant on time and waited over 30 minutes , only to find out someone else had already taken the order.

• later, uber’s support team canceled the order , even though i did everything correctly.
• the problem :

• this cancellation has unfairly impacted my cancellation rate, despite the situation being entirely out of my control.

• i reached out to uber support multiple times, but every time i was either transferred to another agent or given the same generic response: ""we cannot change your cancellation rate.""

• their excuse :

• they keep repeating that cancellations are automatically calculated and cannot be adjusted manually.

• 
however, they fail to address the fact that i didn’t cancel the trip—their own support team did!

• my efforts :

• i’ve explained the situation multiple times, provided all the details, and even escalated the issue to what they claim is their ""highest level of support.""

• unfortunately, no one seems willing to take responsibility or provide a fair resolution.
• what i’m looking for :

• a simple adjustment to my cancellation rate to exclude this incident, as it was not my fault.

• if they can’t do that, at least an explanation of why this unfair penalty remains on my record.

• final thoughts :

• it’s incredibly demotivating as a driver to face penalties for situations completely beyond your control.

• uber claims to value its drivers, but this experience makes me question that statement.

has anyone else faced a similar issue? how did you handle it? any advice on what i can do next would be appreciated.

thanks for reading, and let’s discuss how we can push for better treatment as drivers.",2025-02-22 02:37:31,6,11,Reddit,UberEats
"a customer who tried to cheat the system and me. i can't believe what happened yesterday. 

i had an order that i was delivering for a customer who was paying me $20 to drive 12 mi. it was three hot sandwiches from panera. with three drinks. 

i texted the customer when i was on my way. and as was arriving and i turned the corner to drive to their home, at two blocks from their house, the order was canceled. 

i looked at my phone in confusion and pulled over. looking in front of me, i saw a man walking toward my car. he waved at me and smiled. when he got to my window, he told me he was the customer who ordered the panera sandwiches. 

i asked him why he canceled his order. 

he told me he changed his mind but i should still give him his food and his drinks and then take him over to jimmy john's - a 2 mile drive down the street - to pick up food. 

i told him i couldn't give him his sandwiches. because he just canceled the order. and because he canceled the order, i would not be paid for the drive i just made. i told him i had to take the sandwiches back to panera and i drove off. 

i do not take passengers ever. i am not authorized to do rides on purpose and intentionally. this guy was scamming uber and me. i did not get paid for that 12-mile trip. 

uber's policy when food is canceled is to dispose of that order or return it to the store. i contacted uber support and told them what this guy did and they told me to dispose of the sandwiches. 

i kept those sandwiches. luckily, they were something i would actually eat. 

looking at the receipt, the guy spent over $60 for those sandwiches and drinks. i guess i have lunch and dinner for the next couple days. 

i wonder how many times this guy has attempted this. and how he may have gotten away with it somehow.

"uber is really pissing me off with their ""it's your fault no matter what"" bs policy tldr- ubers new policy is terrible and makes no sense. it's screwing over customers and drivers.

ever since uber changed their policy and punish drivers for situations out of their control (closed restaurants, stolen orders etc) it's been a s**tstorm. please explain to me why a) i just drove x miles to this restaurant that is closed and not only will uber not compensate for my gas/time, they also count a cancelation against my rating if i let the bot or live agent know. i did my end of the contractual agreement. it's up to uber to fix their app to not have closed stores sent and we need to be compensated and sure as hell not have it be our fault and count against us. 
b) if i again drive x miles to a restaurant and they tell me someone already picked it up why are we again punished for this if i let bot/live support know and then they just cancel and once again we get screwed for not only the amount we agreed to but also the measly $3 for time/gas we used to get and our cancellation rating takes a hit! it is causing good drivers to have to do things they normally wouldn't just to keep their rating in tact. if i let a customer know someone already picked it up and i can't cancel they get pissed bc if they cancel they are charged whatever they paid for the food and if we cancel we get charged our pay and rating. then if the customer complains to support they will just cancel the order anyway and we still lose our pay and rating goes up. sooooo the only thing i can think of is to always ghost order whanever this happens. we get out contractually agreed pay we accepted, and the customer will get a refund. if we do it the ""right way"" like we used to, the customer still gets refunded but the driver gets assf**ked. it's such a dumb unfair policy that makes zero sense. what do you guys do?

i made out a small order, which was only about 2 miles away. i tipped accordingly ($8) for the trip.

the restaurant i ordered from made my order pretty fast, with the driver picking it up pretty fast as well.

however, what concerned me was that afterwards he turned his tracking off, and the estimated arrival was 30-40 mins. it isn't a long drive, and it wasn't fairly busy at the time as well.

when i could see where my driver was at, he didn't drive directly to me. he kind of drove all the way up to a local valley, then began driving all the way back down to me. obviously, it isn't the fastest route to get here.

i've had a few drivers in the past in which i felt like they took long. but it was always when i had ordered during a rush hour at the location. and their tracker never disappeared. 

can i do something about this? i'd usually let it go. but it was a very short, simple order and waiting almost an entire hour just for that feels very unfair. i feel like i tipped a pretty decent amount, with it being a short trip and small order.

"uber eats driver - not receiving direct orders hi all, 

in the last couple of weeks there has been an issue in the area i deliver in where some of the drivers, including myself, no longer receive direct orders. 

an example of this would be from tesco where the customer has to use the merchants app to place the order then it comes through to uber. 

so far at least 6 people i know of are experiencing the same issue and it's impacting the earning potential greatly. 

have tried contacting uber support and they spit out useless nonsense saying there is nothing wrong with my account (same response to others) and try a different location. 

there aren't that many merchants in my area to use uber so it's noticeable when you don't receive orders and others are. it isn't due to being too quiet either. they have just simply stopped sending anything direct such as tesco, mcdonald's, coop and asda. 

has anyone else been experiencing this issue and if so have you had it resolved in any way?

"do you use the dedicated ubereats app?! i have both the uber and ubereats app downloaded on my phone and tend to use the ubereats app while ordering food but i’ve been noticing that the main uber app is getting enhanced a lot with various new feature set to add trains and even flights and boats now. of course it had a separate eats section within the main app since ages as well. 

also have noticed some of my relatives didn’t even know that there was a separate ubereats app out there.

"just had my order stollen placed an order late this evening. the restaurant uses a program called relay to send their own delivery driver instead of uber but works through uber. the app says ""did your order arrive yet?"" but the app auto sends me a text message with link to track the order. i click the link it says delivered. i checked the door, not the there. i check the hallway, not there. the app says view photo, it's in front of the building outside the area where the intercom is. i run downstairs and the order was gone. i called uber eats, they say the order is still showing as ongoing. i told them what happened and they said they would need to call the restaurant.  i called the restaurant and they reddid the order. the delivery person was a woman who gave me this strange look when she handed it off to me as if she got yelled at by the manager for leaving the food in a place where it got stollen.

"why do most drivers not care? or at least seem like they don’t?

time and time again i’ve had the most annoying uber orders for groceries. to preface, we only have one car and my boyfriend works hours when the grocery store is open, so he would be late for work if we shopped and they would be closed if we went out. 

this most recent order i had was frustrating, but maybe the driver was having an issue of some sort. first problem was he sent me a picture of cheddar cheese slices and asked if that was good. i said no, but is there any other blocks? it didn’t have to be a specific brand. i always just choose the cheapest. he then sends a picture of marbled cheese slices. i said no, is there anything else that’s not sliced?? radio silence, but i see he is checking off items from my list here and there. still no response. 

then i get a request for an alternative. i requested a 10lb bag of potatoes and his sub was a tiny bag of little potatoes, like two fistfuls. i messaged him again and said “any kind of potato will do, is there not any other 10lb or even 5lb bags of potatoes?? still, no reply. so i wait a few minutes and he confirms a few more items here and there from what i requested. 

i ask if he can confirm if there is any other potatoes. then i get a notification that he could not find said potatoes so i will be refunded. i added an item to the cart that was a 5 lb bag as a “no, you’re going to find a bag of potatoes for me” kind of gesture. i don’t know how that shows to them on their end when a new item is added.

then for 20 minutes i had 4 items remaining. no further progress was made for that time. no responses to my other messages. not even read. so i contact support and ask them if they could possibly get him to respond to me. they told me they apologize for how long it took. i said that doesn’t matter, is he okay? i explained the potato situation and they said “wait until the order is delivered and then request a refund for the item” and i said no, i just want the proper item! then i get a message saying they changed my driver for me.

the first thing my new driver found? the potatoes i wanted all along. he also found the block of cheese i wanted too! why was that so hard? 

another time i needed a new shower curtain and the driver couldn’t find what i requested. i told him just to get any plastic curtain so long as it was labelled for a shower. he didn’t read my message.the replacement? sheer white curtains for a small window. like over the sink kind of small window. i didn’t see the replacement until it was too late. he left me on read and still chose those.

another time i requested 1 brownie pan and 2 loaf pans. they didn’t have loaf pans which was fine. i told the driver not to worry about the loaf pan, and just get the brownie pan. he bought 1 brownie pan and 2 smaller brownie pans, but in the app it did not show he replaced them at all.

on another occasion i was sent a picture of a wall of pudding options and he claimed the ones i wanted were not in stock, but i could see both of them. i told him to look again because i see them in the picture. he didn’t buy any of them. i got refunded for an item that was on the shelf he didn’t get. 

if you made it this far i just have some questions. 

why do i always get drivers that incompetent? 

in the situation where i had a new driver, logistically does that reflect badly on the old driver if support is contacted with a negative experience like i had?

i understand that there is some wild replacement suggestions, but why don’t drivers consider what the item potentially will be used for? for example if all the items ordered sound like they are going to be for a specific dish, why not consider that?

why is it always men? i’ve never had a bad delivery experience with a woman. i had a driver message me one time and she even suggested an alternative to an item that could work since what i requested wasn’t in stock. 

why don’t men just think and consider if the replacement will serve the purpose it is for?

in the instance that i ended up with 2 items that were not what i wanted (i.e brownie pans) couldn’t drivers just sneakily get that item for the customer they wanted? for example, a driver was arguing with me in order for him to buy the item i wanted, i had to make it  a substitute option or add to my order. the item he took a photo of as an alternative i could not find in the list of items at the store. i tried multiple keywords and could not find it at all. i asked him if he could just get it and mark it as if he did get what i initially requested but he didn’t.

anyways thanks for reading. i am just very frustrated with this app lately and feel like it’s gone downhill. ugh.

"dear ue customers, this is something you need to be aware of... if you order through the restaurant's website, your ue driver (or even dd) will not get your full tip. 

the restaurant will keep a percentage of your tip. i have proof of this when i took an order with a local pizza restaurant. i guess the base pay was really high so, when i went to pick up the order the workers seemed annoyed with me and kept gossiping with each other about how my order ""didn't even have a tip"".

i think it's disgusting that they steal the tips off of my and (other's backs) and have the audacity to be snippy about it. like hire your own drivers then! 

also any tip increases after delivery will go straight to the restaurant too, not your ue driver. i'm sure most of you know about this already but it's something i just learned. 

just to recap, as a customer, if you order through ue you driver will get 100% of your tip. just thought you should know. :)",2025-02-18 18:46:58,2,7,Reddit,UberEats

which, w/e, hustle, but unless he picks it up and comes straight here i won't be home by the time my food arrives and he's been parked, not moving, for 5 minutes now. don't think i can do anything now (besides maybe cancel my tip) but for the future",2025-02-18 17:27:23,3,17,Reddit,UberEats

"drivers pretending to be someone else. hi guys i just kinda have a few questions and also some stuff to say. so for context me and my girlfriend saw a post on facebook the other week of an uber eats driver pretending to be a woman on his uber profile etc, and then sending harassing messages saying things like i want to r**e you and if i give you £10,000 can we have intercourse etc meanwhile the woman receiving these messages is saying no and threatening to call the police. fast forward a week or 2 later and me and my girlfriend order food from uber eats. lo and behold the profile is of a woman wearing a hijab (not racist just context) so me and my girlfriend look at each other knowing full well a grown man is about to appear at our door. 30 mins goes by and shocker, it’s a male of what i would assume to be an asian background. so i confront him and say look, who’s this woman and why are you pretending to be her, after a bit of a stumbled look and a stammer he tells me that it’s his wife and that they share the account, explaining she is down the road completing another order. 
so i say okay as long as you’re not pretending to be her with malicious attentions. 

so now i’m kinda unsettled with this whole situation. we brought it up to uber who assured us this was a normal thing that delivery drivers do and that it’s completely legal.

question 1: is this not some form of identity fraud? 

next my friend and neighbour also frequents uber taxi’s very regularly and he says it’s common for him to book a taxi with car make, color , reg plate xyz and then a different car turns up. (how are you even supposed to know it’s legit) 

question 2: are they insured for this trip and how if they are a different person using a different car. 

i am a male, of average build and average height. and i know how to defend myself when need be and we also have many dogs at my address. so this whole situation doesn’t massively bother me but i know so many girls and women who couldn’t or wouldn’t be able to defend themselves in the worst case scenario and it just feels like uber have absolutely no care for customer safety whatsoever. which fair play, big company, shocker. but oh my days it seems really really poor and really unsafe. especially in todays world.

i recently made an order for over $120 on ubereats. the driver was chosen but the delivery kept being delayed—by five minutes, ten minutes, twenty minutes. a few minutes after the delivery was updated for the last time, i opened the app to double-check arrival time and it said the order has been cancelled. i didn’t cancel it. i immediately called the restaurant, asking if i could go pick up my food since uber could not deliver it, and the restaurant said that uber cancelled the order because the restaurant was overbooked. they hadn’t even begun the order. i didn’t really understand how the restaurant or uber let such a major oversight occur, but i thought it meant that uber would in the bare minimum refund me since it was an issue on their end (the restaurant also said that). i was so wrong: they charged me for the food and a $30 cancellation fee.

i contacted uber—once, twice, thrice, and most recently a fourth time— and each agent kept sending me pre-written messages saying that i cancelled the order and that i wasn’t eligible for a refund. i called the restaurant again to confirm what had happened and i told uber to call the restaurant and confirm that i never cancelled it and that it was an oversight on their end, even when for whatever reason the app said that i cancelled it. they finally said they would forward my issue to a specialized team but have yet to get back to me. what the hell do i do? the money that just went down the drain is not a small amount. i’ve used uber before and never had an issue. i’m pissed with the restaurant, uber, and myself. is uber or the restaurant at fault? any advice from anyone that once experienced something similar? what legal basis do i have on this?

"robbed me of my money i did an order today using ubereats and as soon as i hit the order button, i realized i used my old address. immediately, i hit cancel thinking i could redo the order using the correct address. but come to find out uber eats are a bunch of thieves who don't give refunds.

the chat litterally kicked me off multuple times for asking for a refund after each giving me the same cookie cutter response on how they are the highest level you can speak with, yet their hands are tied.

i will never use any uber or uber eats app or any affiliate ever again.

"changing phone number to a different country hi all,
i moved from the us to another country about a year ago, and though i changed my credit card info, i never updated my phone number. it was never a big deal, because i get most of my info via app notification, but today, the driver was lost and unable to get in touch bc he was calling my old number. i’ve tried updating it on both the uber eats and the uber app, and it gives me an error whenever i type in the verification codes.

uber is a criminal organization the company is trying to screw me out of $17. i placed an order and the store called me asking me to cancel because they didn’t have the item in stock. i canceled and now uber refuses to give me a refund. they tell me it would be unfair to the store because they had supposedly already started preparing my order. i explained to them that the store was the one that asked me to cancel. they said they’d call the store to confirm. then they said the store wouldn’t answer so they couldn’t refund me. i called the store immediately and they said they never received a call. i called the uber eats agent out and they disconnected. this seems like a good lead for a class action lawsuit. i’ll be contacting a lawyer tomorrow.,2025-02-16 21:21:28,35,113,Reddit,UberEats
"careful with offers; 0$ refunds so i used one of the ""spend $x get this thing for free"" offers; in my case, it was a mcdonalds meal that i got for free. obviously i ordered just enough to hit the bar for the offer, and added it.

so the food arrives and the drink is missing for the offer meal. long story short, i get refunded fat $0 and can not submit another ticket as ""i've been refunded"".

i assume the system refunded me how much i paid for the drink, which was 0 dollars, but it has no consideration for the fact that i had to get my order to a certain total to get it so i indirectly did pay for it.

be careful with using the offers that make an item free for you under certain conditions as those will not be refunded if missing. if there is an identical item missing to an offer you got, perhaps consider filing it in as that other item missing instead to avoid not being refunded.

"cancellation and user rating just curious for the other uber eats delivery people. have you noticed the user rating and cancellations seem off? here are some examples:

1) user ratings - doesn't matter how many likes you get, uber will stop showing you how many likes you got after 100. but as soon as a customer gives you a thumbs down your rating drops 1%. the reason i mention this is because they hold that 95% to your throat to become platinum and diamond. to recover from that 1% drop it seems like an eternity of likes to get it back. 

2) cancellations - this seem to work the same way. you can do 1000 delivery's, but the 1 cancellation that happens, you instantly drop 1%. to get that 1% back you need to do another 1000 deliveries. 

it's like uber is holding a carrot in front of you for everything. like climbing a mountain to try and get those back. for those of you wondering why even care, once you go over 5% cancellations you get downgraded as well as under 95% user ratings. 

as a uber delivery person, you get charged a cancellation unfairly if the store is closed or the items you were buying aren't available and it was the only item the customer requested.

it said that to cancel the order, the only option was ""chat with us"", no manual cancellation option. i spent 3 hours with 5 different csrs and they just kept saying that they couldn't help me cancel the order because the merchant hadn't confirmed it. but the issue was that the merchant was never going to confirm it because they were never going to get it because we couldn't schedule the delivery time... i understand that the csrs don't have much control over these things but it was like talking to a brick wall

my issue is that... of the 20 trips i have taken thus far, 6 of them have been missing items.



*the latest was on valentines day when a guy ordered a foil balloon and heart box chocolates. i delivered, and as i was about to take a photo of the two items in her hands, she was on the phone with him and he began shouting to me, ""where the fk is the rose and the bear?""*

*walgreens forgot the single red rose and the giant stuffed plush bear he ordered.*

*i apologized calmly and told him that the chocolates and balloon were all they gave me. i showed the woman my phone screen that listed only his name and the 20-digit delivery number. no itemized list or any way for me - as the package driver - to know what was included.*

a few other times it has been refrigerated items missed because those are kept in the walk-in backroom storage cooler before pickup.

  
the only solution i can think of is to verbally double check with the walgreens/cvs employee that they have everything on the order. take that extra 30-90 seconds to insist they verify that they are giving us everything.",2025-02-16 06:04:36,1,1,Reddit,UberEats

long story short, this sucks. first time being tip baited. frequently get these orders to deliver to the neighboring towns, but i almost never take them (awful pay for high mileage on an accident prone highway, average trip would be 20-40 miles round trip if you lived in the pickup area). however, i commute and do live south of these towns so if it aligns and the pay is okay i'll take one of these orders if i can drop it on my way home.

got this one midday during a snow storm that was bad and getting worse. i was itching to get home so when this came through i thought it was perfect. helped me hit my goal early so i could head home. still drove several miles to the pickup spot in an area i wouldn't have otherwise gone (and the roads were extra scary out there), brought it to the customers house which included a really long (and probably impassable driveway without awd), and a dog that scratched the side of the car when i arrived... all for them to remove the tip and reduce pay to a whopping $19 from the offered $48. beyond angry but at least it was on my way home, i can't imagine if it was some poor soul who took the order then had to drive back to town also.

now, how the heck am i supposed to know if it is an autonomous vehicle? 

and how in the what is an autonomous vehicle going to deliver to my apartment on the 5th floor? 

i tip well because i know the drivers have a thankless job in many cases. i can't believe the app is telling me not to tip and being unclear about whether my order is being delivered by a human or not.

"horrible customer service we ordered out for valentine’s day, i got bubble tea because i felt special and we did a bundled order.

was super excited to get it, it’s been a hot minute since i’ve had bubble tea.

turns out, thing came wide open. no stickers, no seal, nothing. i’m not drinking something that’s wide open! 

so i turned to support to try and get a refund, giving 2 images of the open drink. it takes them 9 hours to get back to me, but whatever.

dude legit says basically “sorry for the inconvenience, we can’t do a refund because of policy.” so i try asking about the policy, even sending a screenshot of their website about food safety and non sealed products.

this b**** says no multiple times and says it’s policy, whats the policy? they say they can’t get me to a higher support because they are, i call bullshit, and that there’s nothing they can do. won’t get me to a new agent and won’t get me a supervisor.

now they won’t respond to me, i’ve been looking for an uber support number but haven’t found one yet. i know there is one and gosh darn it when i do! 

last time i’m using this app, they are ok with allergy refunds and past open container refunds but today is not ok?
like wtf? we only use it because we can’t drive atm and don’t have a vehicle because it’s to expensive.

"customer support is... wow. i never post here on reddit but just have to say.. worst customer service of any company i've ever seen/experienced.

  
i have a video recording of my uber driver show up to my house with the wrong order. take a picture of the wrong order in front of my door. post that picture of the wrong order for the picture used when they select ""completed order"" to the uber app itself so even uber can see it they posted a picture of a meal not even from where i ordered food. i then have the recording of their uber driver pick that same meal up, and just walk off with it to their car and leave. (tldr recorded a meal stolen on my security cameras).   
  
i went to refund it on the app, got to the ""click for refund"" button. decided hmm.. this isn't right. person probably shouldn't be driving for them let me call the company and tell someone about this.   
  
person i talked to said the driver followed all guidelines (stealing) and they would not give me a refund. i told them i have it recorded and they completely ignored that fact. i then asked for a supervisor or something to report a driver and was told i couldn't be transferred but i would be called back within 24 hours. (within about 30 seconds of hanging up after being told ""our driver did everything right per our guidelines and even if you talk to a supervisor they use the same system as me so you will not get a refund"" i clicked the button on the app and got my refund. unfortunately it didn't refund my tip.. so the thief got my 8 dollar tip which sort of infuriates me... so..

3 days later i called again,  asking if i was on a list for a supervisor callback. was told yes, and within 24 hours from that call i'd speak to a supervisor. 

1 week later i called again and spoke to the rudest person i've ever talked too, who again told me ""you'll receive a call within 24 hours of this call"" and then they hung up on me when i asked for a scheduled call later in the week since i was told \~160 hours before that i'd get a call back in 24 hours. 

went to ubereats support on x. i was again told driver followed all guidelines, that they reviewed everything in about 30 minutes and the driver did nothing wrong. even though.. i have it recorded.. that my uber driver... took a picture of food on my porch.. and then picked it back up and walked off with it. on video. would not confirm if i'd get a call back or not and instantly closed my ticket and sent me a ""support on x"" link to review their customer support (you can imagine how i filled that out lol.)

that said..   
most of the drivers i've had were fantastic and seem to enjoy the job honestly. thank you to the drivers who actually do the job truthfully, i wish you nothing but good and proper tips!   
  
hopefully no1 has a problem because from my pov after speaking with 4 people and 2 tickets through the app, not a single person actually cared to help at all. 

  
anyways, rant over. good luck with everyone's ubereats orders! ",2025-02-15 09:45:07,4,14,Reddit,UberEats

"if you're not at all familiar with canadian/american grocery items and neglect to educate yourself, then don't accept grocery orders. these indian immigrants are really illuminating their general attitude with the lack of willingness to assimilate in any way. almost every grocery order placed has had the same issues: wrong items, totally inappropriate substitutions, canceled items that were verified to be in stock, and zero communication. i always tip handsomely for grocery orders because i know they're much more difficult but this comes with the expectation that drivers will at least put in the effort to fulfill the order accurately. it's crazy to me that on a reasonably sized grocery order drivers are doing this, and in one fell swoop are losing out on $20-$30. it's actually the one situation where i get so much satisfaction from turning the tip to $0 because it's totally deserved. these drivers clearly need better training but he poor communication is entirely on them. drivers with less than 90% rating shouldn't be allowed to take grocery orders either.",2025-02-15 07:23:17,0,13,Reddit,UberEats

"is there a lifetime limit on ubereats refunds? they’ll let you keep spending but no refunds even if the restaurant made a mistake? i made a post a couple of days ago about a situation where there was a piece of plastic in some food that i ordered, and uber eats’ support in the app kept giving generic responses basically saying “no refund”. 

out of principle, i decided i was going to go full-throttle to force them to refund me my money. with a bit of trickery and nastiness, i was able to pull it off, but it took several attempts through different channels. 

according to the last agent, my account has a “restriction”, supposedly because i’ve reached a limit for refunds. which makes no sense, as i have made only a handful of orders in the past year and not one of them had a single refund or complaint. 

a few years ago i had a few orders from the same restaurant that kept having the same problem, and i submitted a complaint which resulted in them refunding the order (which i didn’t even ask for), and eventually i gave up and decided to stop ordering from that place. 

upon google searching, apparently there is a “lifetime limit” on refunds… even if they were done ages ago. 

am i understanding correctly that even if a restaurant 100% makes a complete mistake if my order, i’m somehow supposed to expect that there’s a 0% chance i’ll get a refund all because of some mistakes that other restaurants made years ago?

if this is true, how is this even legal to be able to accept payments from customers, but with an instituted “we don’t allow them to use the refund feature” policy that deliberately prevents me from getting any recourse when things go wrong?

"hour late delivery, cold food, customer support disconnected. what recourse? hi all,

another one of these. an order from a local vendor was quoted a 10-25 minute delivery with a t+50 minute “latest delivery” time.

the order took 1:10 to show up and the food arrived cold.

i tried contacting customer support once the latest delivery time was exceeded and was given the typical “20% or cancel” option. the first agent tried to pressure me into accepting an option before my delivery arrived, but i told them i was waiting for the food to arrive to see whether the order was hot and complete. this agent then “recapped” the chat saying that i had refused the option. i repeated the fact that i was waiting. the agent then disconnected the chat.

i started a second chat, was connected to the same agent again. when i said that that agent had misrepresented my concern and that my order had still not arrived, this agent disconnected again.

a third chat with a second agent after the food arrived cold was “resolved” by them automatically applying the 20% credit.

"should i start giving a bad rating? hi! i have a question for all of you.

 i have written in my instructions not to ring the doorbell; instead, text me when they arrive, and i will get it. this is because i often have to eat very late (12/1 am), and i live with people. i do not want the other people i live with to be woken up by the doorbell sounds since they have an opposite schedule to me and usually need to get up early in the mornings. 

usually, there is no problem, and everything goes smoothly; however, occasionally, my doorbell rings. sometimes incessantly, in these instances, i am always polite, and i still give good reviews and tips because, at the end of the day, i got my food, and they were kind enough to deliver it.

recently, i noticed that my doorbell rings around 1 in 3 times, which annoys me. i live in a triplex, and the walls/floors are thin, so everyone in the building can hear it, which i can imagine is very annoying for everyone else, too. i am unsure how to be more transparent about my instructions; it is the first thing written, and it is in all caps in multiple languages (bilingual city). i think i will start giving out poor ratings, which i don't like to do and feel bad about, but i'm unsure of any other way. hopefully, when the person receives the review and notes they missed instructions, they might be more inclined to read them.  

is this an appropriate issue to give a bad review, and should i start doing that? do you guys have any other solutions to this problem?  for any drivers reading, i would especially love to hear your thoughts on the matter. perhaps uber is not giving them my instructions, or there are technical issues on their end? maybe they don't speak the different languages i used in the instructions.

"f ubereats figured i'd add to the dog pile of complaints on customer service. 

i ordered groceries last week for $100. i work three jobs and have back issues, so the convenience was the original purpose of ordering. since i've moved into my place over three years ago, couriers have been trash with following instructions on leaving the orders, or they haven't been the actual people delivering (which is against their policy). this time around, while i was staring at the online website for communication with my driver, i saw it was delivered (no phone call, which is typical) but nothing was found.

logged the missing order, and had two reps tell me they couldn't refund as the driver made attempts to communicate with me through the app (saw no messages while on the website) and told me to call them to figure things out (but how can i if they marked the order as complete and can't the option isn't available). called to speak to a live rep, same response.

not my best moment, but i went off of all of them. years of inconsistent service, and now i have to pay for their mistakes. they then ignored my request to speak to a manager in the morning (all of this occurred from 9:30pm until 11:30pm), and had someone call me at 1am. no solution, just npc scripting.

cancelled my account with them, called my bank to dispute the claim and thankfully they covered me.

driver accepts order, waits 15 minutes in the parking lot picks up the beer then sits outside my house in his car for like 5 minutes. i open the door walk outside and he says he needs to take this back to the store and i should cancel the order. 

i ask him why they even let him take it in the first place and that ive already paid, why the hell am i the one cancelling and this asshole peels off down my street.

"tired of being a cosmic plaything sometimes just because i have a car. was in a 24/7 cvs buying some things for myself when i get a wendy's order (i kept the app open because it's a popular spot for deliveries). didn't get one, but i got one for a wendy's 5 miles out. quiet town, easy enough $7 delivery, sure.

i get there and discover the order is just two frostys and this wendy's in particular closes at midnight so naturally the frosty machine is down. order canceled, no compensation, and screw me i guess. i'll be doing uber for a decade this 2015 and i'm well aware of the risks every time i accept a ride or a delivery, but it's only with deliveries where i can get completely and utterly screwed over despite doing everything correctly.

doordash gives you half of the pay when shenanigans like this happen, yet uber expects me to just go pound sand in this case. that was a complete waste of a drive and of my 15 minutes, and to complete this sundae of misery, you know where my next delivery came from? *the same cvs i was just at*

"ubereats support sucks i can't deal with uber support anymore. lately, i've had multiple issues with my orders—some arrive damaged, some have missing items, and others have been outright stolen, totaling over $400 in losses. every time i reach out to uber support, whether for stolen or damaged food, they tell me the order isn’t eligible for a refund. strangely, this only seems to happen with orders i pay $90 or more for, and i don’t understand why.

tonight, i’m especially upset because i’m pregnant and was really craving a duc de lorraine. since the restaurant is far from my house, i also ordered a coffee which the reason i ordered . but when the driver arrived he  spilled the coffee at my apartment door. not only did i not get to drink it, but i also had to clean up the mess. when i submitted a picture to uber, they again told me the order wasn’t eligible for a refund.

i just don’t understand—what actually *is* eligible? on top of that, the customer support agents are consistently rude, talking as if they’re the ones paying for my order.",2025-02-10 23:17:05,2,4,Reddit,UberEats

"be careful when order friendly’s at least on ubereats anyway. depending on your city, they will repeatedly load up the driver with other orders, prompting yours to come late and cold (regardless of tip) unless you’re closest to the restaurant. 

i’m used to having drivers have one order along the way prior to me. usually, that person lives closer to the restaurant than i do (based on the gps map in the app). no worries. but repeatedly from friendly’s, my delivery time is delayed by 15-30 minutes or more due to the restaurant providing the driver with multiple orders to deliver. 

the order of the delivery addresses seem all over the place, and not in order of proximity.  i personally live 20 minutes from the restaurant, so i don’t expect to be delivered first, but i don’t expect my stuff to be delivered late and cold either. and yes, i did tip. i’ve ordered from places farther than this, and the food was delivered hot and tastes as it should. 

this wasn’t always an issue before, as i’ve ordered from this same location numerous times over the years. i’m not sure what happened. i know it’s not the driver’s fault. it’s still frustrating, and i now realize i can’t order from this restaurant anymore.

ubereats continues to scam people.  i ordered food at lunch so i thought i would take advantage of some promotions they were having.  i order extra food when i see a buy 1, get 1 free deal so i have them for another meal.  when i got the receipt, i didn't get my buy 1, get 1 free and they were out of the avocado ranch i paid for on 4 items.  the restaurant sent me a coupon for a free taco which doesn't even add up to the extra money i paid for the 4 avocado ranch sauces i ordered to be on my food.  then ubereats claimed their buy 1, get 1 free was not on their phone app and they asked me to send them a prtsc of the bogo offer.  this scam has been going on for so long.  can ubereats really not afford to pay their it people enough to hire coders who can actually write apps that work on both a phone and a pc?  you still can't send an image unless you're using their phone app (which i don't).  i order via ubereats through my browser on my computer.  then he said someone would send me an e-mail.  seriously?  the last time they said that, no one sent anything.  god, i can't wait until my doordash account is fixed so i can create a new one.  there's another programming problem (although a different company) - why are they charging people thousands of dollars for a college degree if when they actually get a job, they can't figure out how to write a simple code that allows things will work on both a pc and a phone?  i wouldn't have even ordered from ubereats if my doordash account hadn't gotten so screwed up i had to delete it so i could make a clean, fresh one. smh.  

also, there has to be something seriously wrong with this country when taco bell has run out of ingredients by noon on superbowl sunday. 🤦🏻‍♀️

"beware (new?) customer support policies when ordering with ubereats i just finished a support chat about an order i placed, which was never delivered to my address or neighboring addresses. on top of that, even if the order had arrived, it would’ve been a completely different order. i ordered an ethernet cable, and the item shown in the picture was an extension cord/power strip. 

the support agent said there’s nothing to be done, and that the customer takes responsibility when ordering from uber eats for wrong orders and orders that are delivered at the wrong address.

"a rant i ordered uber eats the other day. and i might get hated on for being a 'snob' or whatever but a) ubereats is far from an essential and if you're paying to be literally waited on and ran to you deserve a bit of princess feeling. 

anyways, its -45 here in canada, just ridiculous rn. so i treat myself to uber eats despite my financial situation. but it's not a regular thing. i got the leave at door so i didn't even have to interact and i could stay under the covers in comfort clothes. 

then buddy calls me, he says come get your food from the car. i'm like oh i chose the leave at door option thanks. (i'm already annoyed i even had to pick up the phone and deal with it, but again i ordered a princess service i want it to be a princess experience). he straight up refused to. said that i'ts cold..ya i get it thats exactly why i chose to get uber. 

anyways, at the end of the pettiness i basically said bring it up or take it back and refund me. and he did. i'm happy the food wasn't opened lol.. anyways rant over. i'm not saying i was perfect in the situation , but it still pissed me off when i woke up so i felt writing it out would make me feel better",2025-02-09 12:18:11,1,10,Reddit,UberEats
"uber eats customer service is a joke – no escalation, no accountability i’ve been a loyal uber eats customer, spending a lot each month, but after my recent experience, i’m done.

last night, i ordered food, and one of the items (a drink) was missing. i noticed immediately and called the driver...no answer. i went to the uber eats app for help, only to find out there’s no live chat anymore, just a form where they promise to get back to you in 48 hours.

hours later, i got an email saying their “investigation” showed my order was complete, but i have a picture proving the drink wasn’t delivered and security footage showing the driver didn’t have it.

so, i called customer service. absolute nightmare. no escalation process. the rep even admitted she could see the drink wasn’t there but said her system “wouldn’t let her” issue a refund. i asked for a supervisor. they don’t transfer to supervisors. instead, they took my number and promised a callback within 24 hours. that call never came.

i called again, worse experience. the rep refused to escalate, talked like a robot, and just told me to “watch my email.” meanwhile, i received multiple rejection emails, each with a different nonsense excuse (like the eta of my order...what does that have to do with my missing drink?).

at this point, it’s not about the refund. it’s about uber eats having zero accountability and the worst customer service i’ve ever experienced. no escalation, no ability for reps to fix mistakes, and no way to hold them accountable. i feel like they are taking advantage big time. 

if you’re spending money on uber eats, just know: if something goes wrong, they don’t care, and you won’t get help.

edit: i looked into cancelling...i'm on yearly billing and it just renewed in december. their policy says you have access through the next billing period. i'm definitely screwed.",2025-02-09 12:05:51,2,4,Reddit,UberEats
"delivery is taking over an hour and the driver is moving away from the restaurant this is getting ridiculous, ive messaged my delivery driver after noticing that the latest delivery was supposed to be at 16:05 and it was already past that time, despite her being so far away from the restaurant. ive gotten no reply, so i then call her and she comes at me with an attitude, of course immediately begins speaking to me in english, assuming im supposed to know the language she knows and not vice versa. i kindly, but firmy explain to her that she hasnt moved in 15 minutes and ask if everything is okay and she tells me its not her fault, cause she was in the store???? she accepted my order before she even went to the store, i was monitoring it after seeing that she has had very little deliveries with a 53% satisfaction rate (not sure how she managed to get that many tbh). i then tell her that she is late, her reasoning is not my problem, especially if its something as mundane as going to the grocery store and not something that could be considered an emergency. after that she didnt move for another 5 minutes, then started driving away from the restaurant??? i send her another message, letting her know that she mustve gotten it wrong. and what do i see after? her car isnt moving. shes at another store. i might go insane. i set my delivery to ""leave at the door"", lets see of she at least gives me the pleasure of me not having to interact with her irl (if i even get my food in the first place that is)

my question is: can i do something to compensate for my inconvenience and the cold food im about to receive? the restaurant is 10 minutes away from my house, there is no reason for this to take this long (fyi i placed my order at 15:00 and its now 16:25)

"""hey bro! u smok?"" ... no. something strange over the last week and a half of doing uber eats deliveries has occurred. not necessarily the same customer, but generally, two or three of the same customers keep asking me via text when i accept the offer of taking their food to them or their groceries the question in the title.

obviously, i do not smoke. anything. or perhaps not so obviously to those of you who don't know me. 

the fact is, i am highly allergic to tobacco, thus cigarette smoke is akin to spraying mace in my face. the same reaction in my lungs, nose, mouth, and everything. 

some of them have asked me if i can bring them weed or if i have some on me that i can sell to them. i've had offers ranging between $5 and $200 in cash if i happen to have some grass on me. 

which i definitely do not. i respect people's choices to do what they wish with the legally allowed consumables and smokables, as long as it doesn't come into direct contact with me. 

i'm just getting a little bit frustrated is all, with how many people keep asking me to bring them something to smoke.

"drivers don’t care about your tips. we care about the total compensation we get to bring you your order. 

typically $2 per mile is considered reasonable to cover our expenses and make some profit.

the problem is uber is only offering us $2-3 to drive 5, 10, or more miles. only the most desperate or new drivers will take these orders. so your chance of getting a good competent driver who puts your food in a warming bag, remembers your drinks, and doesn’t tamper with your food is a lot lower.

when you think tip you probably think “reward for a job well done” but in the uber app where it says tip you should read it as bid.

you’re not tipping us for our service you’re bidding for a driver. 

when you say “if you don’t like it get a better job!” we hear you and we get a better job by delivering to your neighbor who bids a reasonable amount.",2025-02-09 03:43:13,10,55,Reddit,UberEats

i’ve been hearing rumors that doordash (or people acting on their behalf) might be behind this, trying to frustrate uber eats drivers enough to quit and switch platforms. it sounds wild, but with how competitive the gig economy is, i wouldn’t put it past them.

"uber eats delivery driver assaulted me and threatened me and my partner. tl:dr - uber eats driver we had a bad history with stole my food, got mad when i asked for a refund, came to my house to assault me and walked away limping and charged.


alright, i dont post often, but i thought this would be interesting to some...

today i ordered breakfast from uber eats, i waited outside (in canada, its cold up here) after i had noticed it was reported as delivered. after about 15 minutes i was cold so i went inside, looked at my app, then realized the driver name. 

this driver had an issue about a month and a half ago where they had made a delivery, missed some items, so uber had auto refunded my account. i guess this dropped the tip percentage? (i believe the delivery driver and i still dont really know what happened, but thats my best guess). i may also note that; i tip very well, always 20% and up. anyways, this driver in the confusion about the tip, came to my house an hour later and started getting mad at me about lowering his tip, at this point i had just explained that i have never done that in my life and he walked away fairly unsatisfied.

cut to this morning, as soon as i saw the name, i knew something was up, (my thought were this guy was gunna screw me over for thinking i lowered his tip last time). i reported the order as not delivered because well, the order was not delivered.

uber immediately issues a refund, and about 10 minutes later, the driver shows up banging on my door, telling me to come out and calling me a slime bag and other worse names. so i went out to explain everything and hopefully come to some kind of truse or something... mistake.

he immediately starts yelling, i can get no words in, and starts pushing me, then swings a punch that nicks my nose. this guy is fairly tall and has a hell of a reach so my first retalitory strike completely misses and sends me in a panic, so i get in close and we get in a big scuffle which at one point had him getting rear naked choked... i tell him during this to chill out and we need to talk about this, and in his position he just accepted so i let go. he immediately turns around and punches me again, so i get him back in a choke but this time im kinda pissed about the cheap shot so i start yelling and squeezing until my partner and neighbour chilled me out while calling the cops, so i let go. he rolled around squirming and looked pretty rough, i told him to get off the property while he ran around saying he'll bash me and my partners heads in and ""we have it coming"".

cops showed up, we placed charges, the ambulance brought him to hospital and he was acting so crazy they kicked him out. the cops called back and told us to lock our doors and install cameras because hes unhinged and released.

this is all such a mess, i order from uber almost 3 times a day... maybe time to save some money and westher the cold... 

i never post, so i apologize if there are any grammer mistakes or other errors posters make...

update - cops had initially scared me when they had said if he had sustained any bodily harm that this would blow up a little more, but they had informed me that he was okay, and actually got kicked out of the hospital. the doctor had said he thinks he was playing it up.

i got in contact with their investigation team, and had to give my story like 3 different times, plus photos of the injuries. they couldnt inform me if any action would be taken regarding his employment (confidentiality, i get it), but they had informed me of his take of the story, which me and my partner found fairly laughable.

""he dropped the food off, and left, then i reported it not delivered so he came back and knocked at my door, after i didnt answer he went to leave, and as his back was turned i had struck him""

i told them all the details of my side again and told them to get the police report if needed and provided them with the number.

"uber driver stole my order and uber refuses to refund me after a long and tiring day at work i decided i’d treat myself to a delivery rather than cooking a meal. i order some chipotle and once the food is “delivered” i check at the door and there is nothing there. after calling the driver and not getting an answer, i check our front camera.

the driver pulls up in front of my house, sends me a black screen as proof of delivery and then drives off after the delivery was “completed” without ever exiting his vehicle. i know it was him in the footage because its time stamped and matches the delivery time exactly (also im on a dead end street so cars dont just drive by for no reason) and the car also matches the car that the uber app said the driver was using for the delivery.

after sending this evidence to uber support they somehow come to the conclusion that they cant confirm the order was not delivered and the order is not eligible for a refund.

im sorry what?

what part of this evidence was not conclusive? how can they possibly justify thievery by one of their workers caught on film?

i’ve only ever had to contact uber support 3 times in the last 5 years but just for this one case i had to reach out to them 12 separate times over the last 5 days (order was made monday and its now friday). and possibly the most frustrating part is that they eventually started claiming that it was past 48 hours from the order time so there is nothing they could do. when in actuality i had been contacting them everyday this week since the order was made asking for them to resolve it. how can you place a 48 hour restriction on a case that is still open??

and dont even get me started on the bullshit copy paste scripted answers they provide, through chat, email, and via phone. how is it possible for someone on the phone to truly sound like a bot? there were no substantive answers provided at all, it really feels like uber support is there to support uber and the thieves they hire, not the customers.

at this point i feel like im the one in the wrong. why did i pay to order food when i could’ve worked for uber and had a free meal while getting paid.

satisfaction rate today was kind of frustrating and funny. i'm an african-american woman and anyone who knows us also know that we change our appearance like we change our clothes one day our hair may be long maybe short maybe red maybe blonde maybe jet black. a customer reported me for someone else delivering my orders other than myself it's funny because all i did was took out my extensions i went from a black barbie to afro puff also the customer gave me a thumbs down which resulted in my customer satisfaction going down to 96%. this is crazy and ridiculous i am so discouraged right now i work hard to maintain 100% rating and all it takes is for a customer to call in or to rate someone based on their appearance doesn't look like they're photo. uber this is ridiculous and you know something should be done about it,2025-02-08 00:17:08,3,2,Reddit,UberEats

"ubereats uk lately, i've noticed a horrible decline in the quality of ubereats uk. customer service has become almost non-existent—every response is just an automated message, and they don’t seem to care about customer satisfaction at all.

orders are consistently late, and it takes forever to find a delivery person. sometimes, the order gets canceled after waiting for ages. even when the food finally arrives, it’s often cold or missing items.

is anyone else experiencing the same issues? or is it just my area? how does it compare to deliveroo or just eat?

so i called the driver and they said that someone else from a previous stop accepted the order(?) and that they were gonna try and get it back but it never happened. as i look on the app a few minutes later uber says my order is completed but i never gave the driver my code because we never met.

i called the driver again and they said that uber ended the order on his end but the problem is i can’t contact the driver anymore so he can advocate for me and tell what happened to him.

this is my first post on reddit. i wanted to share with you a bad situation that i encountered some days ago, with ubereats.
basically i decided to order myself 5 items, which were supposed to be delivered at my door. however, it happened that the delivery driver texted me on the app that he literally refused to climb the stairs to my door (it was obviously written in the summary of the order that there were some stairs to climb, and it has never been a problem for the other delivery drivers). in the end he decided to leave the order at the bottom of the stairs and i had to pick up myself the order. obviously i injured myself in the stairs (i have some health issues). anyway, i contacted the customer service yesterday. i told them about the situation and i even provided them with the screenshots of my conversation with the delivery driver. short story short they literally did nothing. just some automatic apologies. not mentioning that it is not the first time that they mess up with my orders. i even decided to stop using ubereats because of that.

when i got to my second pickup the restraunt informed me that they just had someone pick up the order, but a second order came in for the same name and same food. they asked me to wait a minute and said ""i hope they meant to order twice.""

i waited a few minutes and got the food. this was of course listed as my first drop off, so i went and delivered it and confirmed. then i got to my second drop off, but the name wasn't what was on the order...

naturally i assumed i had forgotten to confirm delivery on the order. so i confirmed the delivery, but than i had no more deliveries?

then i realized i must have delivered the wrong orders!? the 1st customer actually called me and stated i dropped off the wrong order so i went back. i then went back to my second drop off... to only discover that the person did not work for the company i delivered too.

i gave up... either uber screwed up, or i had really screwed up... i have over 100 deliveries with 100% satisfaction and 1% late... i only bring that up, because it's not like me to get these confused. this is the first time i had any issues delivering.

i ended up giving the 2 pizzas to the company and said it's on me, because i'm really confused and i didn't have time to figure it out. i figured i'd settle with uber and either get no payment or they'd charge me etc...

"i don’t order delivery a lot, but i’ve never had an issue getting my eats order delivered. as i read this sub it’s crazy how many of you have issues, so i thought i’d throw out some tidbits i do.  i’m in the us if that matters.

1.)  always check the distance [miles] of the restaurant to your location.

2.)  always tip appropriately, i’m not saying you have to go way over board, but if you’re simply ordering a $10 meal and think 1, or 2 bucks is enough, it isn’t!  the eats driver is doing our lazy asses a huge favor.

i pretty much only order on the weekends, and that’s usually sundays after i’ve done all the crap around the house and had some drinks while doing said things.

so i order from hooters:  it’s 1.5 miles from my house, i order a build your own burger with fries and sometimes a dessert.  the total comes in between 22 - 30 dollars depending on the above and with that type of total i tip between 6-8 dollars.

my order shows up hot, fresh and on time every single time i order.  and you know what, i don’t mind paying that much at all, because it’s a complete convenience to have food delivered from restaurants that don’t even freaking deliver themselves anyway.",2025-02-05 17:44:13,8,16,Reddit,UberEats

so i applied to work for ue, dd, and lyft back in september of 2024. almost immediately got approved to deliver food and packages with ubereats. i ran orders for about 3 weeks, when out of no where i logged into the app to work a little and boom i get hit with a ""your account has been permanently banned from all uber platforms"" that was it, there was no explanation, i got no emails from them or checkr known as ""c"" (the background check company them and almost every if not all delivery companies use to run their backgrounds, some of yall have had the pleasure of dealing with them personally). anyway so i contacted the so called ""customer support reps"" for uber, and of course they are zero help once i finally get a live person on chat, and after they transferred me 10 times to 10 different people. all they said is my account has been deactivated and to look out for a ""adverse action"" email from them and/or c. which still has not come in. 

i went on c website and looked up my background check, and there was 4 charges on there the shows as ""plead gulity"" to that was discharged 100% through courts. and in the court documents it literally says ""once discharged, charges are to be removed and employers can not use these charges to deny employment"".

contacted c regarding this and disputed background items (sent over all related court documentsto prove that it is false), and they sent back ""our background check is 100% accurate and correct"", because of this ue, dd and lyft, denied me employment. i contacted my attorney about it and they stated this is 100% illegal what they are doing because they sent false report to all three companies and refused to change or remove the false items. well...... my attorney contacted c, and filed paperwork and the day the paperwork was received by them. dd and lyft both reversed their denial and hired me on the spot. but ue was still not moving. my attorney sent them a demand letter two weeks ago with all the relevant details. they just now responded to them. my attorney forwarded me the email with the subject line ""do you want to reapply for ues?"" 

letter basically states they reviewed my account and reactivated my ue food and parcel account and can start running orders, but my rideshare account will not be activated because i had a ""charge"" back in 2005 when i was 17 for a misdemeanor. and i should ""reapply"" to try and challenge their decision.

what would yall do in this situation? my thoughts are ""hell no"" their customer service is horrible and the way they treated me back when it all first started is not how a company is supposed to treat their employees.

"violent customer damaged my car i contacted uber after a customer kicked my car. 
i watched a wingstop order for $3 being passed around for a about 30 minutes. finally they raised it to 6 and it was 2 miles away and near where i was headed. so at 6, i grabbed it. i get to the customer and they selected meet me at door. its 9 at night, no porch light, whatever, i have a flashlight. i immediately send a message saying i have arrived, that starts the timer. i knock, and nothing, silence. i call the customer. it rings before going dead, no voicemail, no answer. i ring the doorbell twice. silence. i have another delivery drop off 8 minutes away. i prioritized this drop off first, when i could have just as easily done it last. i cant take a picture, the app doesnt allow it until the timer is expired. i cant contact the customer and they are not answering the door. if i leave the order, i dont have proof and neither can i show the customer where it was left.... perfect recipe for a customer to lie. so i leave to deliver the other order and will double back.
right after i drop off the 2nd order i get a call. she is saying they cant find the food. no acknowledging the hand to me or my repeated messages saying i had arrived 8 minutes prior. i tell the customer i didnt leave it, she selected hand to me, i am on a timer before i can take a picture to leave it and i cant be late for another delivery because they are mia and wont answer the door or phone. i let her know ill double back and that was the plan, a major inconvenience for me and if i was stealing the food, i wouldnt answer or double back. she says the order isnt for her, its for her daughter who has been waiting at the door and she didnt see me. i tell her your daughter is not at the door, nobody answered the bell or door or phone and i have another delivery, she too ask why i didnt leave it, and i explain. she again ask me to ring the bell when i arrive, i respond with, i did ring it twice, i didnt hear anything, i think it may be broken. she says she will have her daughter wait outside. great.
upon my arrival there are 5 people waiting outside, she is actually hiding behind the door, up the stairs with a dude blocking her part way. i immediately start telling them they selected meet me at door which has a timer before i even get the option to take a picture, it isnt an option until the timer is up. i cant tell you how many meet me i have had customers no show on and then claim they didnt get their food. this was an uber pay order,the customer didnt tip, i expect shady actions around no tippers as too many have proved it over the years. the group all starts talking at once and keeps cutting me off, they don't want ansers, they want a fight. its been less than 10 minutes since the timer expired and they didnt reach out until it expired,meaning they have been waiting less than 10 minutes since they were alerted i arrived.
not to be judgemental but the whole crowd looked ate up, like they do meth and fent. and the way the were all talking over each other showed not a single person was capable of rational thought. i told her the difference between leave at door and meet me and the picture function is not available until a countdown is reached on meet me at door. of course she was mad she had to wait 8 more minutes instead of realizing she played the critical role in not receiving her food when i was there the first time. so all her friends see it is her mess up but instead of being cordial or respectful of my time and the fact i came back which shows my intentions, she ask me why i didnt ring the bell, i tell her i did twice, and she loses it, if it wasnt for the dude in her way she would have flown off those steps. i am still surrounded by 3 other people at my back and her on the steps above me. she screams while trying to get around the dude, ""now i know your effing lying mother effer, i was sitting right effing there"" she yelled that while jumping and losing it trying to get around dude. i immediately grabbed my insulated bag with the food in it and ran to my car. these low class trash were looking for a fight over 3 chicken strips, they werent looking for solutions or to understand how their actions made them wait longer. i got the vibe the girl was just out of jail, as im running to the car because she was trying to get past the dude to get to me, she does get past him and throws her drink at my car and something else and then runs and launches herself onto my car, kicking it. 

there is a reason uber has driver pass a background check, but they don't do the same for customers. that mom ordered her adult daughter food and then neither wanted to be available for communication or delivery. and then she wanted to be violent because of her own disregard for other peoples time.

the food was in an electrical heated bag, it was as hot as when it was first made. ive had customers tell me they have waited hours for a driver to be assigned or waited close to an hour for delivery after pick up.

this girl waited less than 8 minutes. she didnt pay for it, her mom did. talk about entitled and spoiled or possibly drug induced brain damage.

uber was contacted, a police report was filed since i know her name and address.
uber is willing to compensate me with an inconvenience fee, i just need estimates for the damage.

if you are going to order for someone else, be available for communication. communicate to the recipient when it will be there. if you select, meet me at the door, and then you purposely ignore the door so you dont have to see someone, know you are taking time from us that we do not get paid for.
she was incredibly entitled to receiving her order but gave no thoughts about other people who ordered and were waiting for their food because of her selfish choices. 

choosing to fight the person bringing you food says you have more issues than needing a meal.

delivery drivers are not here for you to mistreat and abuse. it doesnt matter if you tip 20 dollars or 0. if you do not like the service,  contact uber. if you are playing a role in why your order is delayed, take responsibility. if you selectmeet at door, be available to answer the door.

once you raise your voice and start cursing at me while threatening bodily harm, i take your order and report you. you wanna damage my car? this is why i have a dash cam. i do not know a single person who would continue to provide service to anyone who was so aggressive and disrespectful. drivers reserve that same right. at that point, i was absolutely going to take a photo for proof of delivery and when a customer makes it unsafe to stay and take a photo, they dont get their food. you do not get to create an unsafe environment and then demand service.

there are bad drivers,  i encounter them regularly and clean up after them regularly. 

some customers are just as bad. this girl just lost her mom's ability to use the uber eats platform because of her behavior and actions.

"driver survey: how would you prefer to be tipped? delivery drivers, i have a legitimate question: what would you rather your tips be based on?  


1. **time** spent on an order: assume a reasonable amount of time to the restaurant, food ready, then to the drop off point, without major traffic or unforeseen wait.
2. **distance** traveled: the distance to and from the restaurant varies, regardless of speed of travel.
3. **percentage** of the total order: regardless of time or distance, a specific percentage of the total order (you can specify a different percentage, but assume 20% otherwise).

note that the first two may not necessarily correlate. assume you cannot pick the option of ""whichever is highest"".

examples to consider...

* an order totaling $70 includes several courses in one bag, no drinks, and you drive about 10 minutes to the restaurant, five minutes inside, then another 15 minutes to the drop off point to hand the bag to the customer. total job: 30 minutes, about 6 miles to/from destination.
* an order totaling $15 in one bag, no drinks, you drive **mostly on the highway**, no traffic. total job: 30 minutes, about 20 miles to/from restaurant to customer.
* an order totaling $15 in one bag, no drinks, **street driving**, no traffic. total job: 30 minutes, about 6 miles to/from destination.  ",2025-02-03 13:47:24,1,67,Reddit,UberEats

new seasons was awful. so pretentious. they didn’t even have half of the items and one of employees was confused because one of the items she wanted they haven’t had for months. so of course i’m marking these unavailable and she’s doing substitutions, but then she decides she doesn’t want the substitutions so i have to put all those back. also, she’s continuing to add stuff. 

i get to the checkout and the employee is too busy talking to another employee and he barely wants to help me, he’s taking forever, he’s arguing with me that i’m supposed to have a qr code and i said not all of the stores have them and  he is so slow begging these five items because he’s again too busy talking to his coworker. i finally had to tell him that i’m on a time crunch and he finally speeds up. after all that, the customer reduced my tip by $2.00. 

ue isn’t terrible in my area and i haven’t been tip baited in a while but f**k those people that penalize the shopper for what the store is lacking. ",2025-02-02 23:49:55,1,2,Reddit,UberEats

"horrible service. cancelled my membership so occasionally you get those free for 3 months uber one deals and i got that. i’ve used these kind of services semi regularly since like 2017 when i entered college. 

i used to have no real issues with it. like anything else involving takeout sometimes your order gets messed up so you complain and get a refund or remake or whatever. 

lately my order is always wrong. something whether it’s put at the wrong apartment, forget food, give me the wrong food, the driver is taking different routes (probably doing another delivery), etc. i could forgive this if i ever got refunded but now no matter how much proof i provide it’s always denied. 

a couple weeks ago we got chipotle. 1 burrito 1 bowl. we got 2 bowls so i send a photo of the two bowls saying “this clearly is two bowls, one burrito one bowl”. no refund. then tonight we got dairy queen. 2 blizzards. both completely wrong, wrong size and wrong flavor. send it in: no refund. what does it take to get some corrective action when the service is undeniably incorrect? 

i’m just doing takeout now. if i can’t go get it i don’t need it. ngl i had no reason for posting this other than to complain about it. thanks 💯",2025-02-02 22:07:43,5,4,Reddit,UberEats

"uber doesn't care about you, the customer a little background:  i spent the last twenty years in a customer and client facing managerial position before losing my job and spending the last six months in the job market.  i took up doing uber eats & doordash to keep from completely draining my savings while trying to get back to work.  i say this not to be, ""wow, look at me, i had a corporate job"" but to impress upon the reader that i am not the driver running three phones, mad at the world they didn't make an arbitrary x amount per mile and cancelling orders because sticking it to the man.

so, let's talk customer services failures.  or more specifically, let's talk about ubers complete inability to provide customer service.

how the issue started:  a pickup from a major grocery store, let's call it fom fhum.  when a grocery order comes in from this store the address is correct.  however, when a flower department order comes in, the address is wrong.  the store is on s fm 123, but uber dispatches the driver to fm 123... which is a pharmacy, we will fall it fallgreens, several miles away.  this issue has been reported to uber several times by me and the client.  i have in the past received various answers to this report including, ""we've updated it in the system"", ""we've corrected the problem"", ""we've escalated the issue"" etc. but it never changes.  yesterday, uber took a new route and decided to blame their customer, fom fhum, and say they can't fix it on their end.  okay, let's assume for a second that fom fhum did put their address in wrong (although they didn't, the employee showed me their tablet in frustration), is uber saying they don't have the ability to update an address in their system?  one of my less championed accomplishments in life was managing a dominos pizza sometime around 1998ish.  we absolutely could alter address data.  are we to believe that 2025 uber can't manage 1998 dominos pizza levels of tech?  alternate suggestion:  uber absolultely can fix the issue, but the line level support people don't have the authority.  only a supervisor can, and they can't be bothered.  more on that later.  

so, we already have three levels of customers getting bad service from uber:  fom fumb who keeps having to answer calls from lost drivers at fallgreens across the city.  drivers who are having to add extra miles onto their run and figure out where to go... and of course, the actual customer who isn't getting their product on time.

but we are just getting started.

so, when a driver has multiple uber deliveries they are only shown the address and information of the delivery they are currently on.  when a driver pick up their last delivery from the store they get shown the delivery information for only their first delivery.  which is when i saw that my first delivery had two addresses, one a few blocks away that uber wanted me to go to and a second address the next town over.  now, this isn't ubers fault.  the customer screwed up and put the delivery address in the wrong spot.  but, and i say this with a massive but... customer service is not about fixing what you personally  messed up, it's about making the customers experience enjoyable enough for them to use your business again.  one of the best ways to do that is to fix what the customer messed up.  let's see how uber handles this.  i have two addresses.  i don't know which one is right.  only option, call the customer.  yeah, i kind of ruined the surprise they are getting flowers because the person that ordered put the recipients phone number and not theirs on the order.  oops.  sorry, no real way around that.  but yes, deliver to next town over.  got it.  on the way.  since adding miles going in both ways is going to mess things up on the delivery schedule, i call uber support... and a giant flaming dumpster of horrible customer service results.  uber support says, ""you've have two options, cancel the order or deliver it and get a $4 bonus"".  let's hash out the worst of the two options:

option 1) cancel the order.  uber knows i have talked to the customer.  uber knows the customer knows she has flowers on the way.  uber is okay with me pulling off to the side of fm 123 in the middle of no where, chucking the flowers in the ditch and driving away.    i can't even fathom how this is an option.   i get it, it's not really ubers job to make sure the product gets to the cust.. oh... wait... that's exactly what their job is.  is this a deviation from the expected engagement?  sure.  is it an excellent opportunity to provide amazing customer service by going out of the way to resolve a customer issue?  absolutely.  cancellation should never be an option unless it's physically impossible or dangerous to complete.  not to mention, the order still has to be replaced, and delivered by someone else.  oh, and if a driver accepts the cancelation it goes on their driver score and could get them deactivated.  so, uber is failing all three customers again... in shocking and mind-blowing fashion.

option 2) deliver the order.  this is going to add 8 miles out of town and 8 miles back to town and 20 minutes of time.  orders two and three in my car are going to be late and i am going to take hits in my driver score for that, which could lead to deactivation.  16 additional miles also adds $11.20 to my operating cost.  ubers solution, we will give you a $4 bonus if you continue the delivery.

so, let's review ubers options from a driver perspective.  take option 1 toss the flowers in a ditch, screw the customers (fom fhum and the flower recipient), gain a knock for a cancelled order but keep delivering.   or, take option 2, satisfy both customers, but lose $7.20 in operations costs and take two hits for late deliveries.

obviously, the answer for the driver is to toss the flowers in the ditch.  my customer service trained mind refused to accept that this was the action uber was encouraging, so i asked to escalate the call to a supervisor... and was promptly told none were available but one would call me back.  do you think i ever got a call from a customer support supervisor?  do you?  remember when i said earlier that ubers customer service supervisors can't be bothered?  yeah, well none were bothered on this issue.

and i'm an idiot.  i finished the delivery.  because that's who i am when my name is attached to something.  i am sure plenty of drivers would have tossed the flowers.

but wait, we aren't done.  since the delivery was made to an address miles and miles away from the pin drop location, i couldn't complete it.  normally you can over ride the gps geofence by clicking something that says, ""incorrect location"" or something like that.  that wasn't available.  i guess i was just too far.  if i can't complete the delivery, i can't see the next address to go to.  which means those other two deliveries are just sitting in my car going no where.  so a third call to support...  a third time explaining the problem.  a third time waiting for them to try to resolve the issue.  a third time, in a single order, failing the customers (me waiting on them, fom fhum getting their product delivered late, the recipients getting their orders late).

i did not write this because i particularly hate uber or am vindictive towards them.  i wrote this so customers know exactly what they are dealing with.  i want customers to know that ubers solution to a problem with their order is to encourage the driver to throw it away.  this level of disregard for ubers customers (the store, the delivery recipient and the drivers) is absolutely repulsive to me.  uber needs to do better.  until then, everyone needs to know exactly what they are dealing with when they do business with uber.",2025-02-02 10:46:36,1,4,Reddit,UberEats

"driver refused to leave my order, customer care won't refund update: a couple hours after. cancelling uberone and citing this as the reason i received a message from their ""priority support team"" saying they ""received my escalation"" this was after 3 different agents telling me their was no supervisor to talk to and disconnecting me. so she says she reviewed the order and confirmed the driver requested to cancel it, and refunded me. glad i don't have to go through the credit card chargeback process but still so done with ue.

i've had ubereats for many years and embarrassed to say how much i order. i have uberone has well and have for a few years. just cancelled it after the experience today i can't believe how bad the customer service is. 

i ordered breakfast this morning and the guy was at my door and called me. i asked him to leave at the door (which is on the instructions) and he said he needed me to come to the door. i wasn't able to at the moment and again asked him to just leave it. he said he could not and the order was damaged and there was a mess on the floor. i said its fine please just leave it. he said he couldn't and the order needed to be cancelled.

i went to the door a few minutes after he left and the floor was clean (i thought maybe the drink spilled or something) - he never cancelled the order so i did but was charged for the order. thinking because it was never delivered customer service would actually help me. however this was not the case and three different agents refused to help and disconnected my chat (i wasn't rude or cursing or anything they just said 'there is no other solution available so we are disconnecting')

i'm honestly shocked this is how bad their customer service is especially given all the money i've spent over the years. wake up call i needed to stop - just cancelled uberone and deleted the app. not that they care but the lack of support seems really baffling.",2025-02-02 09:24:14,6,7,Reddit,UberEats

"thumbs down and no feedback i'm getting so fed up with getting thumbs down as an uber eats driver—namely, i'm getting thumbs down with no feedback left.

so let me get this right: i wasn't unprofessional, your order wasn't damaged, and it arrived on time, as the estimated time said it would. i can only assume the customer gives a thumbs down simply because they dislike me or how i look.

should this even be allowed, considering i'm doing nothing wrong and doing my job properly? it's really disheartening. i'm sitting at over 95% positive feedback, but if i get enough people simply giving thumbs down, i lose all the tiny benefits on my current tier, which is platinum.

as things stand, i'll be diamond again next quarter, but if i get knocked down below 90% positive feedback, that means losing my fuel discount and discount on tires—really, the only benefits that matter for the tier anyway.

"livid over priority delivery glitch & unprofessional support agents🤬 i’m a former ue driver myself, so, i know how things go and how, from a driver’s perspective, the customers seem to get any and everything they want like, clearly undeserved refunds resulting in free food, being blind believed and deemed as right against drivers by uber regardless of proof, and other things. y’all can see where i was going with that, though. 

anyway, now that i’m on the customer side, why does it seem like the exact opposite? any issue that i experience with ordered food is ignored. the agents chatted with follow the same irrelevant script(of course) then, randomly end the chat by sending that dumb message about someone will get back to me in 6-12 hours, without solving the issue or even attempting to. in 6-12 hours, i won’t have the same issue!! 🤬

the issue or glitch, or *whatever* that i’ve been experiencing and driven mad by is how i make sure to select *”priority delivery”* in order to get my food while it’s, at least, still warm being that i live pretty far out from the places i can order from. yet, the moment after i complete and pay for the order, i see that it’s switched to *”standard delivery”* for no reason, almost ensuring that i’ll be getting cold food because the system will make the driver stop at 20 different places in between the route to my home. 

whenever i report this issue, the aforementioned chat conversation is what i get.

"how much should you tip? perspective of a driver in a rural area: don’t tip a percentage of the food costs. tip on things like distance from the store, how hard it is to get to your place, how challenging the order is to maneuver.

for example, you order a single sandwich and it goes from mcdonald’s to your clearly addressed home on a well paved road about 2 miles away. a $3 tip is fine.

next example: you order 5 meals all with drinks included. driver needs to go 7 miles and find your hidden unmarked house off a random dirt road that may or may not be on google maps. that is a $12-15 tip for us to want to bother or not lose our minds.

the tip is about how difficult the job is. the more effort i take securing your drinks and food during the drive. the effort i spend trying to find your house. how far i need to go to deliver it. base your tip on those factors and everyone is happy. drivers don’t care how much your food costs you.

edited to add: is it storming outside? trecherous driving conditions? factor that in too!",2025-02-01 13:22:31,13,45,Reddit,UberEats
"delivery driver had a go at me for restaurant being far last weekend i had a lot of family over because it was my dad’s birthday. the original plan was that my cousin and i were going to drive and get takeout from my dad’s favorite pizza place. my cousin is the only who drives and he ended up forgetting about it and had a couple of drinks

so we decided to order it uber eats instead. would be expensive but it’s a birthday thing and we were all going to chip in. the place is a 40 minute drive away so we decided a £25 tip would be fair. our order ended up being about £80+ anyway because we ordered for the whole family 

it took about an hour to show up. when it did i answered the door and took the pizza. after handing it to me he said ‘why the f- would you order from 40 minutes away’. i said that i tipped well because of that but he just said ‘f- off’ and then walked away. i ignored him and enjoyed my night 

i saw the next day my rating had gone down because he i now had a 1 star rating against me 

why did he even accept it? was that tip not enough? ",2025-02-01 13:04:40,1,46,Reddit,UberEats

"anyway to either get in contact with this driver to try to explain or report to ubereats? i was the customer in this experience i have ""please leave at door and knock my dog is an asshole"" ... i get the same order basically daily its about $22 and i tip $10 flat. its only about 1-2 miles away from the store but i get some drivers might have a long drive to even get to the dunkins.... one of the drivers i get often never knocks and leaves it 2 feet away from my door in the middle of the walkway, i can tell when its him after the fact even if i didnt check the driver because im busy coding or what not...  
anyways one day it was very windy and the same things happened. once i got notified of the order (likely a few mins after he left it since he was no where around) my order was already on its side with a 4 inch puddle of coffee and all food ruined. if this driver followed my directions and knocked i would have maybe got to it before it was knocked over, if he didnt leave it 2 feet away in the walkway where it had no support it likely wouldnt have got knocked over either. i had to get refunded my whole order have it resent out so this one time i altered the tip to .01 (it wouldnt let me totally remove it).   
i had no other way to tell the driver what happened and now he harasses me through the app when he gets my order before canceling... ""you are the asshole who changes tip to .01 f\*\*\* you"" etc. i can find no way to answer him to explain since he cancels right after, i usually only see it in my notifs after the fact and i do give $10 tip normally it was just this one circumstance i did this because even with the refund it cost me $9 plus another $32 to get it back to my door.... this happens (messages from this driver) at least 2-3 times a week since the incident. any advice?",2025-02-01 11:21:47,1,12,Reddit,UberEats

"glitch? so last night i started doing uber at 630pm. i got my first two orders fairly quickly which i delivered on time around 7pm. 

as soon as i dropped off my second delivery i got pinged another delivery for a greek food place at the mall nearby which had an estimated delivery time of about 30 minutes paying around $19.

picked up the order around 7:15 and on my way to the customer the customer had texted me.

“do you have my food? priority is at 6, not 8”

i replied confused saying, “yes i have your food. 6? i only received your order after 7pm?”

 i delivered the food on time in fact a few minutes ahead of schedule. 

i knew something was off. the customer ended up deducting $5 off the tip and rating me poorly. 

i take this side gig pretty seriously and im a diamond driver not new to this at all.

i called uber support to explain and the support guy just put me on hold and no one else picked up the call for at least 10 minutes. 

i checked the earning summary and it says that i got this order at 6:06?! i was on my couch having dinner at that time as i had just finished my day job and i was getting my self a meal before starting uber at 630pm. so there was no way i had picked this up at 6:06.

"driver falsely reported me for “physical altercation” a few days ago i was nannying and ordered food to my nanny family’s apartment. i clicked the “leave at building reception” option and provided detailed instructions and a photo of how to find the steps of the lobby as it was not immediately visible (they live in an apartment enclosed in a courtyard so from the street all you can see is a driveway). either way i was working in the apartment when i saw (through a window) my delivery driver walk down the driveway, drop off the food, and leave. then i went to the lobby about 15 minutes after the driver had already left(!!!) to get my food, where a neighbour arriving at the same time had to hand me my food as i could not reach it with the baby on my hip. in other words, i had no interaction with this driver whatsoever, and it was a normal delivery.

so imagine my shock when the next day i receive an email that my uber eats account has been suspended following “a concerning report from [my] delivery person from a recent delivery where [i was] involved in a physical altercation.” i know it was from this recent order as the last order i placed was at least a month ago.

this isn’t a case of a misunderstanding - i literally had zero interaction with this driver, and unless something happened to them
before or after they made it down the driveway and into the courtyard, nobody else did either, because i saw them enter, place down the food and leave again. not to mention, even if i had come down to collect my meal in my driver’s presence, i was carrying a baby and was struggling enough to even pick up my food that i required a neighbour’s assistance - there is no possible way i could’ve gotten in anything that could have been interpreted as a physical altercation.

i am just so maddened about this injustice. i’ve heard of uber customers falsely reporting things to get refunded but never the other way around. i even gave my driver 5 stars and a 15% tip for the bother of finding the apartment lobby so i don’t think she did it out of spite for having to find the entrance?? uber called me today to hear “my side of the story” but all the woman on the phone asked me was “can you recall any recent delivery in which you physically assaulted or attacked your delivery driver” and i obviously said “no, i barely even interact with my drivers as i always ask them to leave it at the door”. the woman just said she’d get back to me in 3-5 days with a decision.

it’s worth mentioning if they do ban my account i can prove my innocence through security camera footage in the lobby, so it’s not the biggest deal as i know i’m in the right and can definitively prove it, but this whole thing has left me outraged. do any drivers have any insight on why this might have happened? do drivers get any benefit from reporting customers falsely or is this just a strange fluke? i want this lying driver banned and ideally some sort of compensation from uber for the inconvenience and defamatory false claim made by one of their drivers but not sure if this is possible.",2025-02-01 08:27:07,8,5,Reddit,UberEats

"uber eats uk customer services and drivers i am in the uk, and when i receive my latest refund, i will be closing my uber account. i’ve had enough of both the drivers and the customer services and i was wondering how other people had found them.
roughly 9 out of 10 deliveries i get are made by a person not matching the profile picture and driving the wrong vehicle. most times they overshoot my road and have to turn around and come back, no big deal but now they’ve started calling me to say they can’t find my house. this happens with the location sharing both on and off.
yesterday i ordered a mcdonald’s and watched on the map as the guy drove in completely the wrong direction for about five minutes. it did not say he had another delivery to make first so i can only assume he was using another app at the same time. this happens regularly.
drivers turn up and ask that i give them the code before they hand over the food. every now and then a driver will ask for positive feedback even though the guy with a beard standing in front of me looks nothing like the young girl that was in the profile picture.
yesterday the driver tried to give me the wrong order but i realised and called him back. he took the order away with him and said i would get a phone call. no surprise this didn’t happen. customer services would not refund me without a photo of the wrong order even though i explained the situation twice, luckily i was able to get a refund another way.
this is just my personal experience and i’m not saying this relates to all drivers, but the majority of the ones i meet are completely incompetent and can barely speak the language. that seems to go for customer services as well. on the odd occasion i get a genuine driver who matches the profile picture and vehicle, they usually tell me all about all the drivers who rent accounts.
i’m going to give just eat a try and see if that is any better.

"question regarding whether something is normal we ordered food tonight from a popular restaurant before rush hour and left what i thought was an ok tip ($10, 2.6 km from the house, 3 lights). it was an expected 30 minute pickup. 

got the notice it had been picked up and saw that the dasher was there. i was actually shocked because i figured it would take longer than 30 minutes since dashers are busy and drop multiple orders (totally reasonable, i get it, you deserve money). there are a few restaurants on that strip and a lot of restaurants within 10 minutes to pick up additional orders that don't have dashers going more than 15 minutes from my house.

however, i then got a notice my delivery was delayed. i watched the dasher leave the restaurant and drive 20 minutes away to another restaurant area and make multiple stops before heading back to the restaurant to pick up my food. they then made another stop between the restaurant and my house. my food went from a 30 minute expected delivery to over 1.5 hours and was cold and soggy when it arrived. 

is this normal? was $10 not enough for 3 km of a not busy route? i had a migraine tonight so i wasn't up to driving myself, but i feel stupid that i didn't just go considering how much everything cost for it to be gross by the time it arrived. i'm genuinely trying to be understanding, i get that you deserve to make as much money as possible while dashing, but it seems like maybe if she wasn't happy with the tip she could have dropped the delivery and let someone else take it?

i'd love a reality check here so i can better understand and be less upset at spending so much on gross food. thanks!

edit, it's been a few hours so it's possible a few of the time estimates are off, but the 30 minutes to 1.5 hours was not based on notification timestamps on my phone. ",2025-01-31 23:46:22,0,11,Reddit,UberEats

being the antisocial one that i am, my husband finally convinced me to just call the restaurant. i did, and lo and behold they were waiting for my call because the first driver, jose, came and picked up the order then acted as if he couldn’t fulfill the order and passed it on to another driver!  

the restaurant recommended i call uber eats to let them know, but there is no customer service number for uber eats.  literally, jose is out here stealing sushi and there is literally no way to report him. 

lucky for us, uber cancelled the order at no charge and i was able to call the restaurant and order from them directly for pick up. 

the best part of the whole story is that i sent my husband to pick up the food. he calls me from the restaurant “they don’t have an order for you, do you remember who you spoke to?” no because i just ordered sushi i didn’t ask for the person’s first name?? i was like wtf so i gave him the number and they told him i had ordered from the boca ratón location. that is about an hour and a half from us. 

turns out, my husband went to the wrong restaurant. so now it’s 9:17 pm on a friday, and a simple uber eats sushi order has turned into a two and a half hour mission, all thanks to jose from miami, the uber eats driver who stole our sushi and got away with it.

"why does my driver keep getting changed? i’ve been using doordash for a while now and i got sick with their way of doing things and how easy it was for them to steal orders so i moved over to uber eats not thinking much of it. but as of recently for the past month, every time i’ve ordered from somewhere it always takes two or three drivers before i get my order. sometimes i won’t even get an order after the second one cancels i don’t know why. i usually tip five dollars if i can. or a little bit more. i’m not made of money, but after i pay my bills and make sure everything is straight, i like to buy myself something to snack on instead of cooking for that night. so for anyone who asks i do pay my bills. but for some reason, it’s like they’ll accept the order and then don’t pick it up. just tonight i ordered something at 10:20pm. now i’m already frustrated because i have to go get an oil change tomorrow so i can’t drive my car right now anywhere far. the green turtle is about 15 minutes away from me. so as i’m waiting for my order, i see one young lady who accepts it and it’s almost at the store. then all of a sudden i got a whole new driver who’s already picking up two orders an hour later. an  hour later knowing that the store closes at 12am. i couldn’t believe it. i ordered an hour ahead to make sure i would get my order and i still ended up not getting it. so now i’m going to file a formal complaint onto uber eats requesting my money back. because i’d rather have my food arrive cold than me not get it at all. if anyone knows how to solve this problem of uber driver’s just going to the place and then not picking it up, please let me know and if you’re having the same problem, let me know. i left doordash because this bull crap was happening and i’m not about to have the same stuff happen on this app as well.

i disputed the charge with my credit card and “won”. i’m sept 2024, the merchant stated they would not fight the charge. not the verbiage that was used but essentially the point.
in nov 1024, i placed a ride with uber for transport from the airport. and would you believe that uber eats charged me for the ride and the once disputed charge. it was so sneaky.
i called the merchant directly and even reached out to uber eats again to no avail. they doubled down and what was even more frustrating, they had moved to an online resolution process. i couldn’t even call them. 
so i disputed the charge again with my credit card. they confirmed the first dispute and the message from the merchant re not pursuing the charge back in sept 2024.
i received the credit again but the charge sits in my uber eats account as a charge that was not “processed”. i cannot place another uber eats order until paid. and i dare not place another uber less they sneak through with the charge. 
so now, i use doordash and lyft
 i feel like they’re bullying me into paying something that has absolutely nothing to do with me.

"uber illegal strategies and million losses: could they ever be recovered? hey guys, i've shared this a time ago, but in case you missed it, here is an article about uber’s ipo scandal back in 2019 and how they’re solving this now:

[https://www.benzinga.com/markets/24/09/40755761/uber-from-ipo-hype-to-investor-fallout](https://www.benzinga.com/markets/24/09/40755761/uber-from-ipo-hype-to-investor-fallout)   



here is the tldr: uber’s may 2019 ipo was one of the most anticipated, positioning itself as a world-changing platform poised for multi-decade growth.



but by q2 2019, things started to look shaky. uber reported a massive $5 billion loss, with its slowest-ever revenue growth, raising serious concerns about its aggressive ""growth-at-any-cost"" strategy.



regulatory troubles made things worse. uber faced criticism for practices like classifying drivers as independent contractors instead of employees. on top of that, the company was accused of using software called “greyball” to evade regulators and faced scrutiny in international markets like india and brazil.



these issues, along with safety concerns—highlighted by over 3,000 reported safety incidents in 2018 alone—undermined investor confidence. by october 2019, just five months after its ipo, uber’s stock had lost a third of its value, falling to around $30 per share. 



all these situations and controversies led investors to file a lawsuit, accusing uber of misleading them about its risks and growth potential.



fast forward to today, and uber has already agreed to settle with a $200 million payout, and even if the deadline has passed, they’re accepting late claims. so, if you bought shares back then, you might be eligible to [file a claim](https://11thestate.com/cases/uber-investor-settlement) and recover some of your losses.



now, the good news is that uber has come a long way since those rocky early days. under khosrowshahi’s leadership, the company shifted focus to more sustainable growth and improving company culture. 



by 2023, uber posted its first-ever annual operating profit of $1.1 billion and a net profit of $1.9 billion—a dramatic turnaround from the $9.1 billion loss it reported in 2022. the strategy has been about balancing growth with responsibility, and wall street seems to approve.



anyways, do you think uber can fully recover from its troubled ipo and become a long-term success story? and for those who held $uber shares back then, how much did you lose?

"disclaimer hello uber eats drivers,

i want to remind you of the serious crime of tampering with food.

according to the united states department of justice, subsection (a) of 18 u.s.c. § 1365 states that it is illegal to cause harm to someone's food. this is a crime punishable by imprisonment.

i recently received an order where an uber eats driver decided to eat part of my food and still handed it off to me.

i understand that the job can be difficult and that uber may not pay drivers fairly. however, this is not the consumer's fault. on a $30 order, i tipped $3 before delivery — that is 10%, even for an order that might arrive cold. if you deliver well and i am completely satisfied, i add more at the end of the delivery. if i am unhappy, consider yourself fortunate to have received the initial 10%.

if you choose to ""stick it to the customer,"" understand that this is a serious legal matter. tampering with food could potentially endanger someone's life, especially if they have food allergies or sensitivities. if this happens, i will not hesitate to take the necessary steps to ensure accountability so this does not happen to someone else.

drivers, please remember that you have the ability to pick and choose which orders to accept. if you’re unhappy with the tip, simply don’t take the order. this is an easy way to avoid legal consequences. at the end of the day, uber will refund me, and you will lose whatever payment you earned — not to mention, i will reduce the tip to zero.

please be wise and enjoy delivering with uber. 😊",2025-01-28 06:48:16,0,54,Reddit,UberEats

"was my food likely stolen by the driver? we ordered food the other night and the driver marked it as delivered, but not to our house. the photo clearly isn’t our house and didn’t look like anyone’s nearby. when the order left the restaurant it mentioned that the driver had other orders to drop off. one of them was a few blocks from us. 

we call the driver and just got no where with him. he claims he delivered it, but couldn’t tell us where. didn’t know what order it was. couldn’t remember where he dropped it off. couldn’t explain himself or answer any kind of question. wouldn’t go back to pick it up or tell us where to pick it up. just useless. he says he’s already on the highway going home to his wife. 

i hang up and realized the app showed the drop off in the map. sure enough it shows the he dropped it off around where another order was showing as being a stop for the driver before ours. 

then i realized he probably just kept the food for himself, and used the same photo and drop off location as the order before ours. also explains why he was being so unhelpful on the phone. 

i’ve never had this happen before. uber refunded us no problem but then we had to place a new order and wait longer. which we did through door dash this time. ",2025-01-27 19:23:15,9,5,Reddit,UberEats

"there should be a literacy and a common sense test before getting this gig… i’m a customer, and i do tip a minimum of $5 every time i order. i’ll be honest in saying that half the drivers have room-temperature iq. they always call me for directions despite there being detailed instructions with pictures. i’ve had instances where the driver made me drive to the end of the subdivision because he couldn’t read english and just left the order at the wrong house. i’ve never had issues with drivers that spoke the language natively, but the bottom 50% of the drivers are ruining it for the ones that are competent. almost everyone i know doesn’t use uber anymore or has stopped tipping entirely.

long story short i reverified my account to do deliveries but they only allow walking deliveries and bike deliveries and i want to do it by car.

my question is, would they have any way of verifying that you’re actually in a car vs a bike or walking? i don’t want to get my account banned for using the different vehicle type than what i selected. i really could use the money right now since i don’t have stable work to keep me afloat for the time being.

"annoyed what the heck did they do to their algorithm, since the beginning of january all of my orders take over 45-75 minutes to be delivered. they continuously keep adding time to delivery quoting the latest arrival.

if a placed an order with an eta of 20-30 minutes, why is it taking an hour!!!!

this is reoccurring and it doesn’t matter the distance of the restaurant it’s always an additional 30-40 minutes 

edit: this inconvenience has made me use the platform waaaaay less than i normally do and in retrospect, that’s good for me lol 

update: 
placed an order at 4:45 with an initial eta of 5:05
driver assigned at 4:49 with an updated eta of 5:15
it’s 5:18, new eta is 5:27 with the latest arrival shifting to 5:30 (originally 5:10)

there is no option to tip before delivery so i can’t encourage my driver at all

i live in an outerborough in new york, so i doubt there’s a decrease of available drivers and definitely think the platform has changed and is adding more deliveries to drivers route and not notifying customers until they’ve shifted your eta 

all this to say, i’m officially done with this experience, needless to say i have a 4.93 rating and always tip 18-25%

lol eta shifted to 5:29 while typing this

"persistent 5am alcohol order yesterday morning, i got up and started working at 4:00 a.m. as usual. one of my first orders was walgreens to pick up vodka. i thought it was kind of odd to be ordering vodka at 5:00 a.m. but when i arrived at walgreens, the manager on duty, being the only person in the store, told me that alcohol could not be sold by walgreens until after 9:00 a.m.

i accepted that without question and immediately texted the customer that they would have to wait 4 hours to get thier drink. after waiting a few moments and having no response, and the manager telling me i was actually the third person to arrive to pick up this vodka, i contacted uber support and explained the situation and told them to cancel the customer's order because there was no way to fulfill it for another four hours. 

uber support canceled the order and i drove over to chick-fil-a, one of the most frequent pickups for a saturday, only to receive that exact same order offer yet again from the same exact customer at the same exact walgreens, this time for tequila. 

i didn't even put my car in gear. i called tech support again and explained the situation because it was still only 5:30 a.m. i asked them to contact the customer. they put me on hold and called the customer and then came back on the line and said the customer is willing to wait three and a half hours for me to drive to the store and get it. 

i almost lost my sh!t. i remained calm and told them that that was impossible and that no driver in their right mind would ever wait three and a half hours to pick up a single order unless the customer paid us a minimum of $50 and optimally $100 to just sit and wait. 

i had them cancel the order again. 

within 10 minutes, yet another walgreens offer came in for the same exact guy, only this time whiskey. i went through the process again and told them that they need to have this customer order delayed if they placed the order again. because there's no possibility of any driver in their right mind sitting around at walgreens waiting for the clock to tick over to 9:00 a.m. just to get booze for an obvious alcoholic. 

after taking a chick-fil-a order, around 8:00 that customer ordered again and i accepted the order and immediately did the process yet again with uber support to let them know that no one in their right mind is going to sit around for an hour before picking up their booze. 

to say the least, it was a very interesting saturday. 

and i know that i did not have to go through the process of contacting uber support repeatedly. but i know also that multiple drivers had accepted the order, driven to walgreens, been told it's impossible to buy that item until 9:00 a.m., and then canceled the pickup. my goal was to minimize the wasted time for other drivers as well as myself doing exactly that. 

perhaps the best part of this is that, simply by calling uber support four different times, each time i called them, they rewarded me with a $3 or $4 inconvenience compensation paid out to my account. and i guess they have corrected the cancellation percentage because not a single cancellation they did impacted my account, like it used to do.

"uber eats driver stole my iphone out of my restaurant small first time restaurant owner here

  
had an uber driver come into my restaurant and take my phone tonight (cancelled their pick up and left immediately after pocketing the phone) from the cash register area. uber support has been abysmal and winter times are already tough + i live in an area largely affected by natural disasters which has made business even tougher; now i have to find time to buy a phone on top of having to run my restaurant and have a day job as well.

have them on security camera from the time they pull up to the time the take the phone and leave. filed a report with uber and a police report. will uber reimburse me the phone costs once i share the security footage? idk how this guy didnt see the camera right in his face.

"wholesome story it was around christmas (won’t say what year) and i had just gotten my pell grant so we ordered our groceries on uber eats (despite being pretty poor), to do our annual over tip a service worker as we are both service workers. older man who had a hard time with english was my shopper and we all know how scary it is to have a man do your grocery shopping (i jest but seriously why do you guys think cream cheese is a replacement for sour cream?) 

any way, he keeps in communication with me the entire time, sending me pictures, explains what item he’s looking for, apologizes perfusely etc etc. im a mega people pleaser and didn’t really mind because someone is doing the labor of shopping for me so i keep reassuring him. i tell him to let me know when he’s on the way and my partner will carry the groceries up. 

after about two hours of us having friendly back and forth he’s done shopping wooooo!!!!!  something malfunctioned with uber and he couldnt find my address. my partner is outside trying to find him, we are both sosing uber i’m sending him live screenshots of where he is in relation to me. (i really wanted to make nachos!) 

he stops responding!!!!! he wasn’t close when i last checked in so i assume all is lost. suddenly my partner shows up with all of our groceries and tells me about how he really tried to refuse the tip (100$)and how the guy got emotional and apologized etc etc. 

i go to check my uber app, i say thank you so much and have a great night and get left on read. i go to see what it ultimately cost (prior cost of 240) and see that the order was zeroed out. he cancelled the order, i got my groceries. i didn’t even have the money to spend at the time and got 240$ in groceries because i was patient and i met a good person.  i think about him often and i hope he is well.

"got deactivated last year, got better on other apps, want to get back to ubereats title pretty much summarizes it there, but to make a long story short i got into food delivery last year with ubereats. in about 2 months i got deactivated for a lack of high enough ratings. i'm not going to sit here and say that it was undeserved. i made alot of rookie mistakes, i.e not texting customers enough, not securing the drinks in a way where they don't spill during drives, the minor things that would affect orders. so after i got deactivated, i moved to doordash and pretty much applied every single lesson i learned. and now i'm pretty much 100% a better drive and i'm in no danger of being deactivated anytime soon. 

the biggest problem, however, is the fact that i can never have any control over my shifts unless i have 100 deliveries within 30 days, and while i used to be at that level its hard to get back to that level after alot of family obligations and school-related obligations. so part of me longs to come back to ubereats where i can dash whenever i want. 

so i guess my question is simple. is there a path to reactivation? for reference, the deactivation would've been roughly 7-8 months ago and i already appealed the ban before and failed. is there an alternative way to get reactivated, or perhaps even a different way to reapply?

"confronting alcoholic customers so i often do alcohol deliveries from total wine and abc liquors. i prefer these orders because they’re quick and good money, but part of me feels conflicted. here’s some context on why i feel conflicted. my dad passed away last year at the age of 60 due to being an alcoholic. he was drinking almost a half a handle of vodka a day in his final year of his life according to his girlfriend. i do feel guilty because i didn’t speak to him for the last two years of his life due to it just being a toxic relationship due to his alcoholism. i used to think it was a choice, but i realized when he was on his death bed in the hospital in a comma having withdrawals that it might have been a choice in the beginning but it slowly turned into a disease. i don’t think anyone willingly wants to live that lifestyle, but your brain and body depend on it so heavily that you lie to yourself and continue down that slippery slope. it did not seem like a comfortable way to die. so as a driver delivering alcohol i get repeated customers who are most definitely alcoholics. i can’t 100% confirm this, but the patterns are there. part of me wants to say something thinking maybe it will help them to hear concern for their well being from a stranger, but the other part of me says it’s not my business. i understand people might feel conflicted on how to handle these situations and some will just comment “keep it to yourself”, but part of me feels that doing nothing is also being part of the problem. sometimes people need help and don’t know how to ask. i’ve considered that it might piss off a lot of people, but if it helps one wouldn’t that make it all worth it. am i wrong for considering doing this? what would you do?

update:
for those of you that say stop delivering alcohol let me say i have considered this, but i don’t see an issue delivering alcohol. i personally don’t think alcohol is the issue but rather the person when it comes to being an alcoholic. certain people are more inclined to have an addictive nature, so i don’t see an issue with delivering alcohol since there are people i deliver to that don’t abuse it. my father was an alcoholic since his mid twenties. neither my siblings nor i show any tendencies of being an alcoholic. i actually recently decided to become sober to be healthier and for my dad who could never do it. i appreciate hearing the opinions of people who have admitted to dealing with alcoholism themselves and how they would have felt hearing opinions from a stranger. i have not confronted anyone that i deliver to. i have considered it, but i don’t want to pry. i understand people are adults and can make their own decisions. this was more for a discussion of what is morally right when you’re no longer ignorant to what’s happening directly in front of you.

"legit question about ubereats grocery delivery 4 shoppers (instacart trigger warning) i am a veteran buyer of ur food delivery services, 

i consider myself a model custoemr i always tip good leave clear instructions n i always wait behind my door solid snake style and give them time 2 unload every single bag 4 their picture before i open it n take the groceries (i also say thank u have a nice day)

instacart grocery seems 2 be the cream of the crop (no food pun intendend)

zero issues over 100s of orders. maybe 1 issues. but u get what i mean.

ubereats seems 2 be like the wild west. i have 2 use it now because costco discontinued their discount instacart vouchers n still does ubereats. its like every 4th order there is a major issues. eitehr they just randomly dont bring my 2-3 items. i dont mean like they say out of stock. they say they have it, charge it, and its not there. or if i get 2 of something, they only bring me one. 

im not the type of buyer who returns things a lot. i have excellent ebay feedback rating (100 percent buyer rating) but then i have 2 feel bad n go n chat iwth uber n it takes forever 2 convince them that steven only brought me one milk instead of two

even worse i used the feature 2 call steven from the app so he has my number so then i have 2 b paranoid that once uber docks the milk from his hourly wage he is gonna come 2 my house n try to repossess it 

i am getting off on a tangerine, my main question is, why is instacart so much better for groceries? do they have strict policies 2 get really good shoppers. is this like a wwe vs tna sort of thing, like instacart is wwe and u all want to move up there. or is this a case where the uber app is harder 2 use for drivers so its the fault of the big company n the instacart app is better?

"is 30 minutes too long even in the insulated bag? i have customers ordering from distances that even with clear traffic create a 30 minute wait time. with stacked orders it seems like there’s a logical limit to how well an order can be guaranteed fresh. even if you use a hot bag, the way orders get stacked or even the lack of limit on order distance play factors in your ability to receive food “hot.” if you order a restaurant within a short radius of your location then it stands a good chance at being close to standard, but the further out you push an order, not withstanding an expectational tip, direct ordering option , the more likely that food is to sit in a bag and get cold. the worst part is that food delivery companies see these 30 minute wait times as perfectly acceptable to the consumer because they may include a delivery estimate in small print with an optimistic range that doesn’t really mean anything when you get down to the nitty gritty.

i say that the driver has been in the same spot since he got assigned and i really just cancel.

im confused because the bot had given me the option to cancel without fee and chat rep is saying he cant do it and if he does it’ll charge me full amount.

i tell him if he could contact the driver or switch him and he basically says wait until the last min (which is 20 more mins) and says he will wrap up the chat now and closes it.  which i found really unprofessional.

"tipping etiquette? i drove but been in a hiatus while transitioning life stuff. been needing to order out a lot. i mostly just automatically pretip 20%. i usually don’t boost because i can’t make a habit out of it. i’ve noticed some bad service at times and ppl are “thanking” me less often. don’t get me wrong, i don’t need the ego boost of the thanks . 

but i am wondering if the expectation has changed since i was driving. are drivers expecting over 20% now? i might argue that that is a little entitled considering the economy for both driver and customers. i used to strive to give good customer service and had to quit because there were just too many drivers.

"i found a fix for the audio glitch/bug i recently posted here about my dissatisfaction with the uber driver app, particularly its ongoing audio issues. after much frustration, i decided to dig deeper into the problem and managed to find a solution that works. i also think i now understand why the issue occurs in the first place.

the issue happens when playing music from spotify while using the uber driver app for navigation. the navigation voice often lowers the music volume, which is expected, but sometimes the music doesn't return to its normal volume afterward. additionally, the navigation voice comes through at an extremely loud volume while the music doesn’t lower at all, creating an unpleasant experience. it’s incredibly annoying. 

after experimenting and playing around, i discovered that the issue seems tied to how the phone handles audio when connected via bluetooth vs not connected to bluetooth. if your phone’s volume is set to maximum, loading up the uber driver app with the volume on max makes it struggle to adjust the music volume properly. this is because the notification audio, which includes pings for incoming trips or alerts, automatically maximises by default. this happens even if you manually mute the audio.  

for example, if you’ve muted your phone’s audio, you’ll notice that uber pings will still temporarily raise and lower the audio every time a sound is played. this behaviour occurs because silent mode isn’t being used. unlike simply muting the audio, silent mode completely disables notification sounds.  

what seems to be happening is that the audio streams for spotify (music) and the uber notifications (navigation or pings) conflict with each other. there are likely two separate audio channels at play here:  
1. **music channel** (spotify)  
2. **notification channel** (uber driver app pings and navigation)  

the uber driver app prioritises notifications over music. however, if the music volume is set to its maximum, the app appears unable to manage both channels simultaneously, leading to the issues described.  

the solution i found is to mute the volume bar before opening the uber driver app or using bluetooth. by muting the audio, you allow the music to play uninterrupted as it’ll reset to its own channel instead of having the two conflict. navigation instructions still come through clearly and spotify music, but the app no longer attempts to manage both audio streams at once (as long as you mute the audio — not silent the audio — before connecting to bluetooth)

if you’re experiencing similar issues, i’d recommend trying this fix. it’s not ideal, as uber should improve the app’s audio handling, but it’s a practical workaround for now. ",2025-01-24 17:53:45,3,4,Reddit,UberEats

"why do they do this? i do delivery as a side hustle, i know how this job can be. i know how bad uber is as a company. i ordered food from a place that is less than a mile away from my job. estimated arrival less than 20min, cool. then i get matched with a driver and all of a sudden my arrival time is 40+ minutes? 

and all uber has to say about it is ""whoops! looks like we were off about that arrival time! haha we're so silly sometimes!"" and that's it. so now the dude picked up my food and is driving in the opposite direction to go deliver someone else's food miles away because i guess my order got bundled with someone else's. meanwhile im literally two minutes, not even, down the road from the restaurant waiting while my food is getting cold. 

i know it's not the driver's fault. i tipped him well regardless of the short distance. but seriously what the actual f**k is wrong with this app that they would send the driver miles away from the restaurant for the other person when the driver is going to have to double back to come back towards me eventually anyway? 

dude. i seriously can't deal with this company anymore, as a driver and as a customer. if i wasn't stuck at work right now with nobody else here, i would have went and gotten it myself obviously but this is just insane. i'm so tired of things like this happening all the time. like if i could i would cancel the entire order right now and just wait til i get out of work in two hours, but no, can't do that without giving uber free money for a cancellation.

"grocery pickup - 1/10th the drive - map glitch ""have you found the customer?"" no = return the order!? i just got home after a nightmare delivery.

i was offered $45 for a double grocery pickup and drop off driving 18 miles + 2 miles. i tapped accept so fast!

after picking up both orders, i set out to navigate to the first customer, who i will call ""polly"" (not her real name). literally 2 miles into the 18 mile drive, the app popped up a question prompt ""have you found the customer?"" yes or no...

since i was still 16 miles away from the delivery drop off, i tapped ""no"" of course.

in less than 2 seconds, my delivery to ""polly"" was gone. vanished. deleted... wtf?!?

i called uber support on my drive to the second customer, who i will call ""david"" (not his real name).

in short, uber support told me they had lost all information for ""polly"" and to continue with ""david"", so i did.

after dropping off ""david"" groceries, i pulled off the road and called the grocery store. i spent 20 mins on hold, talking to 3 people, in an attempt to find out the customer's delivery address. while on hold, i noticed that the ue navigation showed return to store navigation. i gave up on trying to get anything from the grocery store.

again trying uber support, i was able to identify the customer ""polly"" by first and last name, and they could pull up the return details, which had a ""starting location"": pin on the map --- directly over the customer's delivery address. once a return has been initiated, the precise address, contact info, and customer details are masked, even from uber support. but the pin location for the ""start of return"" is available.

i asked if they could identify the city, neighborhood, and cross-streets. they did. they told me where to find the house, based on the pin drop location for the start of the return.

in the end, i rang the doorbell, a man answered, and i verified he was the husband of ""polly""... while on speaker with uber support at that moment. the man verified his wife's account phone number, which allowed support to change the return to a completed delivery.

i gave him all his groceries and he was super happy not to have to wade through customer support for a refund or re-delivery in 48 hours, which is what he was being told by the uber support chatbot.

\---------------------------

for drivers who may see a popup like that in the middle of driving, ignore it! do not touch it! if you are not even at the drop-off location and it asks ""have you found the customer?"" - keep your hands off the yes/no buttons.

now that i'm home and done for the day, i was able to get the full $45 from both delivery customers, instead of only $20 from ""david""...

was it worth all the stress and frustration? hell no! but it helps. both me and ""polly"".",2025-01-23 17:00:30,2,2,Reddit,UberEats

"overcharged for order i ordered about $43 worth of kfc and tipped the driver about $11. a big part of the order was missing so i was refunded $25, and the tip was subtracted from my credit. the initial holding charge (which i found out was a hold from customer service) was $70. it was then adjusted to $60. the extra $17 dollars were not accounted for. i spoke to customer service the next day when i thought the origin charge was $70, and was told he had to escalate to a higher team and would get a response in 6-12 hours. it's been days (this order was placed on the 16th) and i've followed up twice with no answer. 

i've tried calling the number that comes up on google and the email but was told both were no longer used and the only way to contact customer service was through the app but no one is answering me!! any ideas as to what i can do next? it's almost $20 they stole from me!",2025-01-22 18:45:06,3,16,Reddit,UberEats

"is there a way for uber to adjust your delivery radius? i started a restaurant business and started using the delivery services offered by ubereats, i am incredibly frustrated by their system. unlike other services, which enforce specific delivery radius to ensure efficiency and keep orders within reasonable distances, ubereats seems to accept every order, regardless of how far or impractical it is for delivery. food often will end up cold which leads to unhappy customers. some customer realize that my restaurant is very far and know not to order for next time. but i don't know why their system would let customers from the next town order from me or some ridiculous distance. if i wasn't a friend with the drivers around here i don't think i would know.

"every single time i order im the second stop every single time i use this god forsaken app, my driver is on the other side of the city, drives past my store to another pickup, then delivers it first. some of the time they sit there and wait until they get a second order. i understand if it happens once or twice but its every single time now.

stop advertising 25-40 min pickup if your going to make every delivery take 40+min. 25 min orders taking over an hour just to be given a $3 credit. pathetic company

at my wits end

oh and they make it as painful and obtuse as possible to report certain things, or to actually speak to a person. need to hunt through google to find the customer support number because the cowards probably got too many calls complaining

\*edit\* to everyone saying its because i dont tip enough. why for the love of god does it expect me to tip \*before\* the service? its a gratuity, not a service fee. you want to set your own prices, go start your own business. the fact that the drivers are given the information to cherry pick their orders based on tips is insane. if you think you arent getting paid enough, take it up with your boss or find a different gig, dont provide subpar service because the agreed apon amount may not be high enough for you. ive done delivery jobs before, i never once viewed a tip as a given, never *expected* people to pay a substantial bit more because employers are cheap. if you take a job saying you will do x to the best of your ability, which i hope is what you are saying when you take my money, then you do your best job. its simple. if you want more money do another job.

"is there a way to ensure i don't get paired with a specific delivery driver again? i woke up unusually early and realized i was going to need caffeine in order to make it through the day. i ordered coffee and donuts from dunkin'.

my order was marked as leave at the door, just like it always is.
the driver pulled a trifecta: he ignored my delivery instructions and therefore delivered the food to the wrong door, he didn't take a photo of where he dropped off the food (i didn't think it was possible to bypass the photo requirement, but apparently it is), and worst of all he pounded on the door, waking up everyone else in the house. this was at 5:50am!

this was so unexpected and seemingly aggressive that i decided not to open the door. i messaged him ""this order was leave at the door. please just leave the food and stop pounding on the door!!! you woke up everybody else in the house. it's not even 6 o'clock in the morning dude!!!"" and he got the message. instantly the screen saying the food had been delivered popped up, but with a generic graphic and no photo.

i rated him thumbs down and selected the buttons didn't follow instructions, delivered to the wrong place, and unprofessional (there was no choice for ""driver pounded on my door for a leave at the door order""). will this ensure that i don't ever get matched with this driver for future deliveries? or do i need to call ubereats support to do that? thank you for any/all advice.",2025-01-22 08:44:35,0,37,Reddit,UberEats

"entitled people i see so many posts on here by people wondering why or complaining because a driver took their food or had to wait or had an annoyed driver, etc. when it’s a pretty simple answer. people are entitled. some people believe they should waft a tip around like a carrot on a stick while some drivers (due to having no tip orders from others) feel entitled to take a free meal. now are there nuances? of course, but it really seems to come down to what side of the wall you’re on. but i’ll give you the facts. we get paid based on the order and uber gives us 2$ per starting out (it will increase over time but that means you wait and so do i). non-dumbass driver take 1$ per mile orders. i.e. if i’m going a total of 5 miles (driving to and from) i’m not taking an order less than 5 dollars. that mean regardless of how big the order is tipping based on distance is actually the best things to do. but obviously don’t disrespect people. again y’all complain about us complaining about yall complaining. shits stupid and it’s not gonna stop. ever. because like many situations those on one side have a hard time seeing the other because the wall of reasons they have for being the way they are will do nothing but grow for. this is the way the world works but if you can do your best to not be a part of the problem i believe it can be better. i want a world where y’all aren’t overcharged or stolen from and we are fairly compensated by both the company and our patrons. thank you for reading.",2025-01-21 20:54:33,1,12,Reddit,UberEats

hi, jeff . thanks for reaching out. i’m ruel from uber support. i’ll see what i can do to help you.
we’re sorry to hear that your order was canceled and got charged. let me go ahead and check my resources here.


hi jeff , your order from skillman wok can’t be refunded because they’ve already accepted your order. in the future, we recommend checking information like the items in your cart, address, and any promos before placing your order. to update an order before you place it, select undo. to cancel your order free of charge, be sure to cancel it before the merchant accepts it. we appreciate your understanding.

how are you going to charge me? 

our preparation process begins soon after an order is placed to ensure prompt delivery or pickup. however, once this process begins, we are unable to halt it. we apologize for any inconvenience this may cause.

since the order was canceled after the store accepted it we are unable to process a refund. we hope you understand that we are obliged to pay the store for accepting this order

 i canceled this in less than 1 minute

never received a positive response from them. 

anyone know how to get my money back?

"canceled by uber eats but not canceled?  never in my adult life have i been as pissed off as uber eats made me last night.  i have been an uber one customer for over 2 years and don't typically have anything go wrong with orders.

so last night i placed an order with uber eats.   i received a phone call directly from uber eats support telling me that my driver had a flat tire and that they could not deliver my dinner at 8:30 in the evening. i was told by the gentleman on the phone that this order was being canceled and i needed to reorder my dinner which was already later than we typically eat but c'est la vie.   i did as requested and extended the grace and patience to this young man in support because things happen.   
  
i decided to order from a different restaurant that was closer and paid for priority delivery because of this setback. i noticed when checking on the 2nd order,  that the first order was on its way. i promptly called uber eats support and explained the situation. the cs rep put me on hold for approximately 5 minutes and came back and said order 1 was in front of my house and i could not cancel. 

i asked her to cancel order 2 and she refused saying it was en route. i again explained the only reason there was a 2nd order was because uber eats called me and directed me to place that 2nd order and this was unacceptable and i wanted a manager.     i was told there was no management to speak to and she would arrange an immediate callback.    that call didn't occur and i called back. the 2nd agent put me on hold just like the 1st agent and the 2nd order was delivered to my house. i explained to her repeatedly that this order wasn't needed or wanted and this was directed by uber eats.    she then proceeded to tell me it was my responsibility to ensure that the gentleman who called me from their company followed through and did his job in canceling the original order.    she went on to tell me a different story about ""management"" having 48 hours to respond.    
  
hands down this was the worst customer service experience in my life to date.   the irony is it isn't even about the $$ at this point as much as the principle.  if a company calls you while you are waiting for dinner and tells you they can't meet the expectation and to reorder then it should happen.     to top it off then the first order was completely wrong but that isn't where my anger is. my anger is in being put in a situation i didn't want or need. i was the one that didn't pitch a fit about a flat tire and followed instructions that caused a lot of issues.   

then i went to check my email today to see if maybe their management reached out via email because i want to discuss this.  both agents put the following in their emails -  your conversation with uber - phone conversation resolved.    needless to say, i canceled their service altogether.  i am not going to pay for a subscription to something that was that infuriating.  there are a ton of other delivery options to choose from.

i am in sydney, australia.

i am posting on behalf of a friend, he owns his own made to order cake business but is now looking at mass producing cakes and selling them on platforms such uber eats. 

but he is doing it alone, he is scared that dodgy customers will ask for a refund and apparently uber eats is quite generous with giving refunds even though the order may be right or the delivery driver is careless with the cake even though he will make sure the cake is secured while in transit.

few questions:

1. he is scared that he will not make a profit as dodgy customers will ask for a refund, uber eats fees are high etc...... because his cakes are made to order if someone orders it through his website

"are people selling/renting their accounts? and/or “pimping” out multiple drivers on the same account? i am sure we have all had a delivery by someone who is clearly not the person in the account. maybe even different cars too. 

i had a delivery by someone who’s account i recognized. he had delivered to me countless times before. 

but today, he couldn’t find the driveway entrance, didn’t understand the house number, and didn’t recognize anything about the delivery. 

it got me thinking, maybe it’s a totally different person? and maybe the reason i see this account so much is because there are multiple drivers using it? 

do people rent out their uberdriver accounts (presumably to people who wouldnt be able to get an account)? or do they recruit or traffic people and force them to drive for them?

"how do i fix this recurring issue with uber deliveries to my apartment complex? i’m at my wits’ end with this situation, and i’m hoping someone here has advice. my apartment complex has a single shared address for all its buildings, with only the building numbers distinguishing them (which you can only include in address line 2). unfortunately, when i move the pin to my specific location, it seems to make no difference. drivers consistently go to the wrong spot, which is about 3 minutes away from my actual apartment, and then they wander around trying to find my building and unit.



to make matters worse, there are three apartment complexes right next to each other, and all of them have units with the same numbers. this adds to the confusion because drivers sometimes end up at completely different complexes.



i’ve tried messaging drivers through the app with clear instructions, but some don’t read them or ignore them entirely and head straight to the wrong spot. calling isn’t a reliable option either because about 90% of drivers in my area don’t speak english. i’ve even enabled the “require pin” feature, but many drivers override it and still go to the wrong place.



as someone who works from home and relies on food delivery often, this is becoming a constant and frustrating headache. unless a driver reads and understands my messages, i’m powerless to ensure they get to the right location.



does anyone have advice on how i can make this process smoother or force uber to provide better options for situations like this? any tips or creative solutions would be hugely appreciated!",2025-01-20 13:36:24,1,9,Reddit,UberEats

"comments about my night, questions and concerns tonight was my second night out after taking a break for several years. when i was delivering before, i never had any issues. so, tonight was alot of firsts for me. i picked up an order in one town that was delivered over 22 miles away in another town. i didn't even notice the delivery town when i accepted the order. after i delivered the order, i went offline and checked out the walmart there, grabbed something to drink and then headed back to the pick up town. on the way back, i got notice that i got $1 tip making the pay a little over $8. 😞 lesson learned-check the delivery distance before you accept. the next order i got was from taco bell on the opposite side of town to be delivered near them. quick, easy and paid $6.01. but, the next one was a different story. it was from the taco bell on the side of town i started out at and was delivered over 12 miles out of town. there was a note on the order asking me to leave it at or near the mailbox because i'd get stuck if i drove down their driveway. the map in the uber app dropped me at the wrong address. google map took me to the right address. sure enough, the driveway dipped and was covered in water. so, i left the order in the mailbox, took a picture of it that included the number, marked it delivered and then went home. i didn't get home before i got a message saying that the customer reported it as not received. so, i contacted uber support. i only found ai. before i could get it resolved, i got a notice saying that i had received a $3.25 tip from them making the payout $10.02;⅚;
. i guess they found their food. 😊 but, this makes me wonder about something. if the  order is reported as not received, do i still get paid for it? can the customer change it? can they add a tip if it's reported as not received? will it count against me? i haven't found these answers on the app.

"got into it with a restaurant employee cause they wouldnt give me the order at the drive through before you judge me it would not have escalated if there wasnt a curb blocking the drive through and i was stuck between 2 cars. i wouldnt have had a problem just going inside. 

i pulled up to a restaurant and went straight to the drive through cause around this time (it's 1am) all the restaurants are closed. there was barely any cars so i guessed those were employee cars and i didnt see anyone inside, so instead of wasting my time getting out of my car to try and open the door (it's cold as heck outside btw) i went straight to the drive through. y'all... once i pulled got to the speaker i said i had a pick up and they told me i had to go inside, i told them i was already in the drive through they could just hand it to me it's not a big deal (hence the fact that literally every fast food chain starts giving out ubereats/doordash/grubhub order at the drivethrough after a certain time so what really is the big deal???) her response was ""you have to come inside ma'am"" so i said ""there's people infront of me and behind me and there's a curb right next to me i cant exit the drive through could you just hand it to me at the window?""..... silence was the response i got. so i said ""hello????!"" the response i got was ""you have to come inside"". so im at this point pissed off cause this line is taking forever and i feel like it's so dumb that theyre not just willing to hand it to me like is the bag of food going to magically turn into a unicorn that's gonna committ mass murder if they hand me the food at the drive through??!?!?! like really what is the issue😭
so once i wait in that long ass line for no reason, i pull into a parking spot (agressively) & go inside. i didnt plan on giving anyone hell but i don't do attitudes from anybody. the girl looked about my age i'm 21f so i already wasnt playing with her😭 what irritated me even more was when i went inside there was a couple in line already so i had to wait even longer 😐 like all this waiting when they couldve handed me the food already. they weren't even courteous enough to have it on the pick up shelf either!!! like yall really trying to make this as difficult as possible for me huh!
once the couple ordered their food i said ""so why did i have to come inside yall couldve handed me the order-"" which was met with the girl cutting me off to say ""we dont do that"" ... still nobody has yet to give me a good reason as to why it's that serious.. it's not that deep. i said ""yall couldve did it though yall doing the most give me the food so i can go. wasting my time""
she slams the food down aggressively.. mind you.. this isnt my food😭 why are you doing that to an innocent customers food you weirdo. and it irritated me even more cause if the food got messed up on the inside cause of how she slammed it, the customer wouldve gave me a bad rating for ""mishandling"" their food. so i clocked her and said ""you dont have to work here dumb*** b!&$"" so she said ""you didnt have to come in here"" which i responded with ""well i did so now what""... and there was silence.

i waited and waited and the status said order was being prepared. this pretty much told me that the pay was not worth the drive and it was just sitting there on a shelf.  having drove for uber eats before, i decided to drive and pick it up myself since obviously no one else is going to do it. by the time i got halfway there, i received an offer on my own order. it paid $6.03. this is a totally insulting offer considering the distance involved. but because it was mine, and no one else was going to take it, it made sense for me to take it. 

who the hell takes these orders? office depot and other stores that offer same day delivery need to charge a realistic amount. i was charged $4.99 for a 17 mile delivery. realistically, it probably should have been around 20 to 25 dollars to make it worth anyone's while. i really don't know how you guys make money doing this.

"driver delivered only half the order forcing a confirmation, went back to chipotle and never returned with about $100 in burritos. do i call the police for theft? seriously what is this clown show app. uber isn't helping and won't allow me to call the driver. i'm out $100 and no food.

edit: for all the silly people out there wondering why i'm pissed: 

* driver rolled up and handed my wife a bag. uber considered the transaction completed because the driver had arrived at the geo location.

* we called the driver approx 1-2 minute after her dropoff through the app once it was apparent that 85% of our order was missing (we had cokes and some chips which were delivered but literally everything else was missing). she said she'd go check with chipotle to see if there was a missing order bag and would bring it back if so.

* we then called chipotle and they confirmed that a bag was left behind and that she had just picked it up seconds ago.

* our food never arrived. we were stolen from. the uber eats app did not provide any further avenues towards getting refunded 

the shitty part was that this food was mostly for the movers who were delivering our household goods. so some degenerate uber eats driver just made life shitty for a bunch of hard working dudes.",2025-01-17 13:58:48,140,245,Reddit,UberEats
"walmart deliveries and the mysterious odor....? anyone else been blacklisted for an odor,? not a major odor, but one the guy can only smell a little if he's literally leaning in & sniffing 2 inches from the seat?

sadly, this is the busiest location in my rural area amd we've lost out on a week of earnings over this. cleaned the seat using 5+ different odor eliminators, amd shampooed it last night.

today, was told he could still smell it, after the above scenario!

i said, if he has to sniff that close i don't see how it's hindering deliveries. most are leave at the door, and those that meet at the door aren't coming out and sniffing my seats... 😑

he asked a couple questions like how many deliveries we've done, then said he'll let us deliver and ""see if it comes back, but don't spray anymore, etc.""

it's literally two people that claim the smell it, but we've had multiple loaders and even our neighbor sniffing the seat and not smell anything... ???

"so sick of seeing this... has it become common for others lately, seeing ue/doordash drivers in nice ass $60k+ suvs etc driving around recently? in my area of dfw it's been flooded with all these very clear housewives driving around in expensive ass cars doing this job simply because they're bored? like wtf are y'all playing at man...you married rich for a reason right? but now your messing up my livelihood i support my disabled child with, simply because you're bored sitting at the house?!? literally heard one yesterday saying this talking to another one, laughing and going on like yeah i've got nothing else to do and coming out doing this, like, i just got a bunch of 10 dollar orders so easy to do, meanwhile i was standing there waiting for a 5.85 order thinking how i haven't seen an ""easy"" 10 dollar order in over a freaking week and how my income has dropped easily by 60% over the past 7 weeks, i can't help but look towards all these nice car bored people with their new accounts and perfect ratings with new account promos boosting them as the cause as to why it's total sh*t for the rest of us lately and why i'm struggling like crazy although for years i've had consistently solid ratings. 
sorry but this sh*t really pisses me off when people who don't need to be doing this are out here doing it for kicks while i can't sleep at night wondering how badly the next day will be and whether i can even afford food tomorrow. just isn't right in my book. rant over. 

edit: to those calling me all kinds of stuff, or how i could save money, change my situation etc. backstory on myself. after high school i joined the air force and was planning on staying till retirement, but when i was 20 unknown spinal defects reared their head, got me separated from service and started destroying my life. when i was 22 i could no longer stand for longer than 15-20mins without my legs collapsible under me like they weren't even there. i worked in ems for awhile but eventually became a liability and had to quit. only job that would entertain hiring such a person was pizza delivery until even that, they weren't interested in keeping me around anymore. led me to uber years ago. during this, became sole provider to a 6 month old cause his mother couldn't be bothered anymore and bailed on us. at first uber was enough to support us just enough to keep a roof and a car for work and some food (always cook cheap at home haven't ate out in many years) i don't drink or anything else. over the years, saturation set in along with other things like the economy etc leading to losses in income across the board, eventually leading to us having to move into a spare bedroom at a relatives and pay whatever can in rent. market got even worse, so there goes the car too. for almost 4yrs i've used my relatives car for work. ive been fortunate enough they let me do that, although i have been told by them that if i didn't have my child that i'd probably be out on the streets. i don't even have a nice phone, it's a $20 prepaid one with 2gb that's barely able to even run the uber app albeit it crashes the phone occasionally. its rather easy to say find a different job, cut down on spending etc, but when you've already literally done that, and you can't go find different work because of a condition you can't control, and you're truly stuck in the situation you're in, then maybe then you'd understand my perspective on things. i've already made every single cut back possible, i'm currently wearing clothes that i bought 7yrs ago. i literally eat one bowl of a ramen in the evening, no breakfast no lunch. just that each night. coffee is the $3 jar of instant crap that makes like a 100 cups. its rather easy saying do this do that but guess what, i have. years ago.

"no refund for missing item, again. update: for those of you who think bbb is just yelp for boomers, this genx filed a complaint and got a full credit for the pizza. 

——

ok, first things first: i’m also a driver, so i know what it’s like. but ffs check you make sure you have everything before you complete the pickup. i don’t mean open the bag, but check the receipt and just take a quick glance to make sure it looks like everything is there. because if you go into a 7-eleven, and you see a receipt that says one bag of chips, one candy bar, one bottled drink, and one large pizza, but all you have in your hand is a small bag, you know it ain’t no pizza there. 

but my driver last night did not do this, and i did not get my pizza. i knew he didn’t bring my pizza the second i saw the picture. there was no pizza in that picture. just a bag of snacks. so i tried to call the driver, but he didn’t pick up, then i called 7-eleven and they confirmed that the pizza had been left behind. so then i tried to call uber eats, but of course i couldn’t get through to anybody. finally today i got through to somebody and they’re telling me in no uncertain terms that my order is not eligible for a refund. how is it legal for them to make people pay for things they did not get? i didn’t even ask for a refund, per se, i just wanted a credit.

"uber eats customer support is trash let me detail my saga here since i've already explained it 10+ times to different uber representatives and none of them have either the reading comprehension necessary nor the willingness to resolve my problem.

my problems began january 10th when i was trying to use a promotional offer from a grocery store - 50% off, up to $35 for orders over $70. the promotion which i received an email for had disappeared for whatever reason and so i tried to contact uber support. this was my first mistake, as i would have been much happier had i gone about my day and maybe stubbed my toe.

alas, i did contact uber eats and not easily by the way. you see, uber eats doesn't have an option to just contact a customer representative - no, you have to crawl through and navigate their garbage app just to get to an option where you could talk to a representative and usually for the wrong issue. naively, i decided the best way to go forward would be to select ""a problem with my last order"" and off to the races i went.

at the prompt, i described my issue, namely that a promotional offer i was promised was no longer available and that this had nothing to do with my previous order. naturally, my uber representative didn't read it because why would they? it's not like it's their job. i however, headstrong, persisted and eventually managed to explain my situation in a way that the representative seemed to understand, namely by using small, simple words and repeating them often.

after a conversation that ultimately went nowhere, i was passed along to another representative who asked me what was wrong and so, i explained the situation to them again. that's when they realized that they couldn't help me so they referred me along to their email team. there, i was promised a response within 8-16 hours.

and so, i waited and when i got an email back, my new uber representative became so apologetic because it's part of their script. they asked me for screenshots so i took pictures and passed it along. i waited more hours for a response back and then i got a new representative who naturally, couldn't read.

this representative got it inside their mind that i was referring to a promo not being applied to my previous order, which i had already explained was not the issue. the casual confidence with which this preening moron proclaimed that my issue was resolved was maddening. but you know, this person on the other side is still a person, so i bit my tongue and explained to them again, what the problem was. i then added a couple screenshots that demonstrated that i had received two promotional offers - the first promotion was successfully applied to an earlier grocery order while the second one disappeared and became inaccessible.

and so on and so forth, this cycle continued for days on end with each new representative seemingly less and less capable because none of them could read. in this digital age, it is unfathomable that these chat logs would not be recorded and be accessible to each agent but for whatever reason, they just don't care.

basically, i was passed around like a venereal disease until eventually, after days of this nonsense, i got escalated to a supervisor. they sent me a message apologizing for the inconvenience i'd suffered and reaffirmed uber's commitment to finding a resolution for my problems. they then told me my issue was resolved and that i should answer the customer satisfaction survey. i told them in no uncertain terms that nothing had been resolved and outlined my problem again. we never spoke again.

i was then escalated to a manager who parroted almost the exact thing as the supervisor. i learned about how sorry they were, how apologetic they were, and how committed they were to solving my problems. ""finally"", i thought, ""a real person""! i thanked them for their understanding, i explained my situation again in detail, and then promptly never heard from then again. in other words, i had spent my whole weekend talking to a wall.

seeing as i was getting nowhere, i started a new ticket and this time, i went to complain about the customer service. i thought, ""f*** the promo!"" and went in ready to throw some choice words but my next uber representative apologized so profusely that they immediately forwarded me to their email team so they could help me.

so, i started another ticket, talked to another uber representative to try to lodge a complaint. i demanded to speak to a supervisor. after talking to them for a bit, this representative told me to place the order now and then they'll find a resolution afterwards. i asked for clarification that their advice was to place the order now, they confirmed it, and i threatened to dispute the charge if they failed to apply the promotion. the representative confirmed that this is what i should do and so, i placed my order.

my order was delivered in a poor condition - all my food was collected inside of cheap plastic bags meant for holding produce even though i had to pay a service and bag fee but this is neither here nor there. i would've been well-within my rights to lodge another complaint but based on the track record, god knows these monkeys wouldn't be able to handle that curve ball so i just focused on getting my promotion.

fast forward to today and 3 uber representatives later, each one asking me to take screenshots of the promotional offer i had received with my email, the date it was sent, and the day it expired, i jumped through their hoops only for this final representative to come back to me and say, ""your order was not valid for this promotional because it didn't reach the basket size requirement"". i had ordered $80+ dollars worth of food to hit that get that $70 minimum but my courier adjusted my order, aka removed an item, thus lowering the final amount to be lower than the minimum.

i'm still currently waiting on the ticket for the next uber representative to undoubtedly screw things up but if you were planning on ordering from uber, do yourself a favor and just f***ing don't.",2025-01-16 19:27:11,7,4,Reddit,UberEats

"unpopular opinion on doing ubereats being an uber delivery driver is a great side gig for certain types of people.  so many of you are so negative no wonder you are so unhapoy. 

i have been doing it a few months and it works great for my current life style.

 if you want flexibility, enjoy your alone time but alao like sporadically meeting new people, have lots of good podcasts to listen to, and enjoy driving and want to make 20hr its a good gig at least where i live.  

i have mental illness issues so normal jobs are really hard on my mental health.  sure it may take a toll on my car but my brain is more important.  cars already lose value instantly when you drive it off the lot, its not as big of a deal as people make it.  some people drive 60 min each way to and from work but sit at a desk all day hating their life with little flexibility. 

i also made little business cards and staple them to the bags i deliver and i often get extra tip.  at least 3 a day will be an increased tip and i try to only accept $20/hr deliveries.

"questions  hello, so i've used uber eat for a couple of weeks, and there is just a bunch of questions i can't find on the internet and would like to know.

1. is there only exclusive orders? i have not gotten a single order without the exclusive tag even if i am right next to the same restaurant.

2. after accepting a order, what the time limit before i absolutely have to go to the restaurant (in cases where i am eating, using restroom or in the middle of a game)?

3. apparently in the opportunity section, there is orders which i can take sometimes, and they are all bad with no tips, store type orders (live in ca, so i wonder if these are worth doing).",2025-01-15 22:21:06,2,4,Reddit,UberEats

then i see the final charge to my card. twice the cost than what showed when i checked out on uber eats. i looked closer and saw that the promotion prices were gone and i was instead charge full price for each item (which were also inflated prices compared to normal target price). i immediately contacted support and received no reply. 

a few days later they replied, and said: no it looks right. i replied back with screenshots of the promo prices for the products i purchased, and the fact that my receipt now showed double that advertised price. they disregarded them and said i was charged correctly. 

i disputed with my payment method (paypal) who agreed, and reversed half the charge per my request. yay, i figured that would settle it. 

nope now my uber account shows an amount due of $250 and will not allow me to use uber, uber eats, etc. until it's paid. which obviously i refuse to pay. i tried to close my account because i was so frustrated with them, and they won't let me do that either.

"ubereats 40% off group orders promo seems to be a scam? did this happen to you? tl/dr: has anyone else experienced trying to use ubereats current promo of 40% off a group order, for up to $40 off per participant, and having it glitch out or not function just as youre placing the order?

im wondering if anyone else is experiencing this. ubereats put out this seemingly incredible promo in dec, good through the end of jan (which is an insanely long time for them), where any group order (with the ""participating restaurants"" of course) would get 40% off each person's order up to $40 each. so, for a 3 person order, you could save $120. huge.  
i tried placing an order with some friends and as the order was ""placing"", it suddenly stopped and through up some vague error message about not having fulfilled the promotional details. i read and reread them and couldnt find any reason for the order to not go through. i tried switching a whole bunch of elements- credit card, adding new people, nothing worked. i even tried removing the promo because we just needed the food and even that wouldnt work.

i tried contacting customer service (which, as we know, is generally an enraging, empathy loop of nonsense) and they first told me to place the order without the promo and then contact them (i told them id tried that and it didnt work), then they escalated me, twice, in quick succession on the chat, with the 2nd escalation saying theyd get back to me in ""6-12 hours'. ""but i need my food now"" i replied. nothing. (and that nothing continued for 3 weeks. but more in a moment).

i did in fact need the food, so i placed a regular order (the group order wouldnt go through at all) and immediately replied to the customer service thread that id done so. silence, for days. so i finally opened a new thread, on the order i'd placed to say the promo hadnt applied. they responded that since it was now more than 48 hours since the order, they could do nothing. i wont give you the whole play by play, though im tempted to post screen shots, but there was considerable rage from me. i had contacted them within 48 hrs, just on the original thread, which they were ignoring etc etc. they continued ignoring the original thread until i finally called them, got told i'd be ""escalated"" again (uber-speak for ""ignored"") and then suddenly someone responded on the thread the next day. 3 weeks after they'd last written.

it occurred to me that i was now out $120. on an order that i would very likely have gone elsewhere for, if not for the ""amazing "" promo.

what triggered this post was my brother just tried to use the promo yesterday and the very same thing happened to him. so now im fully wondering- is ubereats making this promo deliberately glitchy (or just non-functional), knowing full well that group orders in particular are likely for events or some sort of more needed, timed activity, and this customers are less likely to abandon the cart if the promo doesnt work?

also, am i missing something here? why would i pick up a walmart order on the other side of town, just to travel 30 mins to a location on the opposite side of town, which is 5 mins from a different walmart??? 

i never filled out a w4, how is it that uber is  ""automatically"" taking out ""taxes & fees""?

is there a supplemental insurance that uber provides that i am not aware of? why is my insurance offering me additional coverage because i am an uber driver? 

why am i waiting up to 72 hours for the tip to process? should never be more than 24 hours to process in my opinion. the resturant & uber, get paid instantly, why dont we? (or at least at a more reasonable timeline) 

trying to figure out the tips & tricks, because my first full day (9 hours on/off, 0800-1900) only equated to an est $125, -$25 gas. i can wait 30-60 mins at times for a cheap single order. now mind you, this was a monday, in a city of half a million, and testing a full days work. i get it that there are peak hours, in your expirience, are the best times to work during ""unsober"" times? night? wknds? 

if i wanted to take note of a non tipper, how do i do that, besides keeping track physically myself? is there a ubereats community that focuses on certain regions? 

it seems that uber works with other delivery services, to 'overlay' maps/requests together. do you run more than one service? ... at the same time or during certain peaks?

so i look for my earnings and there's nothing. the time in miles say 0 minutes and 0 miles. they didn't even get me a flat rate either (which does nothing in california anyway if they don't add the minutes, miles and tip, just comes out of our prop 22 pay). so i questioned this before she hung up on me and she had me wait another 30 minutes on the line while she figured it out. she comes back and tells me that i've had too many cancellations and not i now have a violation for this order. she said that i did not arrive at the drop off location so i will not be paid. well i couldn't get to the drop off location because the customer changed the address to 9 mi away while i was driving there. also i have not canceled an order before, i've been doing this since 2021. i've dropped orders before picking them up but i've never canceled an order once it's in my hands. i see that uber has been calling all orders ""cancelled"" instead of having a completion rate and hidden cancel rate like it used to, and how doordash still does (cancel rate being after it's picked up). 

then she said she will escalate it to a higher support and then hung up on me without transferring me. 

so i just took an hour of my time, had to drive the 6 mi back home so a total of 12 miles, and the food that i'm left with is not anything that i would eat anyways, so i didn't even get a little perk 🙁 i hope that i didn't really get a violation for this and that she was just making it up to make me hang up.

"how to resolve payment and account arrears issue? i was previously paying for uber one with monthly payments. a couple of months ago, i was charged £60 marked as “uber trip.” thinking someone had used my account for a ride, i reported the charge to my bank as unrecognised, and they reversed it. later, i discovered it was an annual uber one charge, which i hadn’t expected since i had been paying monthly.

as a result, my uber account went into arrears, and eventually, my bank reversed the refund and returned the money to uber. however, despite the payment being sent back, my uber account is still in arrears. this means i’ve been charged for a year of uber one, but i still can’t use my account.

i’ve contacted uber multiple times but have gotten nowhere. i keep receiving automated replies saying refunds need to be handled through the app and that i need to clear the arrears, but this doesn’t resolve the issue.

"how much has uber stolen from you? i had a fun situation (sarcasm) with uber eats where a restaurant forgot to pack half of a bbq platter with my meal the platter being about 80$. i called the restaurant and they said id have to deal with uber. fair enough! i contacted uber immediately with pictures and outlined the items missing amounting to $30-40 of missing food. they sent me a $5 uber voucher not even a refund and basically told me to pound sand as they would do nothing else. on one level this is fraud on another level this is uber just stealing $30-40. i now have to negotiate with my cc company to charge back the money uber basically stole.

somebody's stealing...can you guess who? ok guys you need to pay attention here. on the seventh i take an order that is picking up a package from one customer and delivering to another. when i get ti the first customers address they tell me they already cancelled the order so i contact support.  they tell me not a problem you'll be reimbursed within 48 hours. i say ok and hang up. later that night i go to pick up my son in law from work and im wah early so i take and order for $7.51...$3.90 fare and $3.61 tip. i start heading to the restaraunt and an add on pops up for $29.08....$26.08 fare and$3.00 tip and only 4.3 miles away. for a total if $36.59 so i accept it. i pick up both orders deliver the first one and by accident mark both as delivered. i contact support and he says ok not a problem let me contact the customer and see if i can give you their number and address. he puts me on hold and comes back and gives me an address that's over 25 miles away. i instantly got angry but refrained from saying anything. i started heading out to deliver the order and called the customer and asked him if he lived on satucoy..he says yes is there a problem. i said oh no i was just making sure because they had me pick up from a seven eleven that's two cities over from you. he says oh no that's my fault i dudnt change my location he saud but i had given you a four dollar tip and just added another $6. i saud oh well i appreciate it but you didn't have to but i'm almost to your house now. i drop the order to him and go to get gas and my card isn't working.  i looked in the app and they didn't pay me. i contact them and they say i have to wait until the morning when that unit opens up. the customer contacts me and says stacie it's weird i just opened the app and it's not showing my tips i have you so i sent another $6 do you see it. i say no but it probably won't show until they fix the batch because none of its showing. he says we'll you should have a $16 dollar tip now just keep all of it. i thanked him and told him i really appreciate it.  tge next day i open the app and it says customer removed the tip after delivery. i contacted support because they had added the batch pay and then took it plus some back out throwing my earnings into a negative. they tell me yeah the customer removed his tips after delivery. i say ok well can you please just put my batch pay back and they say yeah it will take up to 48 hours. i say fine. 48 hours go by and im still in a negative. i contact them and they start lecturing me on how tips are not mandatory and i shouldn't expect them. i saud i know this i just want my batch pay for both orders i was not paid for. they again tell me another 48 hours. the next day i get paid $7.51 which was fir the first order of tge double batch. the next day neither batch is there still so i contact them again. again i'm told 48 hours and at that point i'm getting heated. but i say ok. later tgat night i get an email and text lecturing me again on how tips are not mandatory and how i shouldn't expect them and that their sorry but they cannot help me further. i email and text back and get no response. i contact them today because it's still not there fir both orders. i get transferred six times to the wrong departments and now im fuming they tell me someone will be contacting me in about an hour. i hang up. half an hour later i get an email and text lecturing me again on how they can't help me because tips are not mandatory. i forgot to mention that the customer contacted me again asking if i got the tip so i told him no they are saying you removed it after i delivered. now he's mad and sends me screen shots showing he tipped $16 and they sent him a receipt showing what he paid for but charged his card $16 more than the receipt. ...so i call support again after getting the dumb text and email again. they get a manager on the phone who proceeds to tell me again the customer removed the tip.  i inform her i have screen shots from the customer that prove otherwise. she foesnt care and says here's what i'll do fir you...i'll give you $20...i said oh no...the whole batch was $36.59 that i acceoted...$7.51 was fir the first order which i got. the second order was $26.08 for fare and $3.00 tip so you owe me $26.08. she says no they tip was fir $3.61 i said no that was fir the first customers. she says yeah but when you accepted tge second order add on it became a batch and share the tip...i about lost it i said are trying to tell me that my first customer has ti share his tip with the add on and she says yes. i lost it. i saud are you out of yoyr head. do you know how illegal tgat is. she starts blaming the system and then says i'll tell you what i'll give you the highest i can give you because this is a week old...i'll give you $25 i grit meld teeth and i say fine..what about my order that canceled earlier that day tgat was $24....she says oh no i can only do the for you in a day. i just sat there completely confused. i said you know what ok..i'll just have my attorney get me the rest plus some. she's ends me the $25 i hang up and decide to start checking all my pay. guys i'm in

"your tip is a bid people are complaining that “it’s not a bid, it’s a tip, call it the right thing, you get the money after services like a tip.”

alright bud, sorry it is not “named” the right thing, you are right, it is a bid! i’ll say it three more times: it’s a bid, it’s a bid, it’s a bid!

you happy? yes it is a bid. the higher you bid, the more likely a driver will pick it up faster and your food won’t arrive cold. sorry that’s just way it works 🤷🏽‍♂️

a good way to calculate a good bid, is see how far the business is from where you live, and at least pay a dollar per mile that the driver has to drive. because ultimately, that’s all we drivers care about. the cost of your meal has nothing to do with how far the driver has to drive.

sorry if the delivery cost ends up being more than your food. get your lazy ass up, and get it yourself if you aren’t willing to pay for the mileage the driver has to drive. 

it should be called a bid, you guys are right. it’s a messed up system, but this is quite simply the way it works. either do it right, or don’t complain if your food arrives cold. that simple, because i’m not driving 20 miles for your 3 dollar tip, unless it is stacked on top of a good tipping order that’s along the way 😁. sorry not sorry. 

ps i reject 80% of y’all’s orders and still make alright money, so this isn’t a complaint about pay, i’m just stating the objective truth about how it is. ",2025-01-13 09:15:12,0,17,Reddit,UberEats

"tipping culture in germany i'm curious because i read how much you guys tip or get tipped in us and that's absolutely  crazy to me. i see people tipping 20$ (in germany you'd order at least for 200€ to make a 20€ tip seem reasonable, i'd say) or 8$ tip für a 20$ order. 

i'm usually tipping if i say "" the service was extraordinary "" and between 5-10% with ""lieferando"" you almost never tip but they work quite differently and i kinda feel pressured to tip when using uber. then i just give 1€ as some kind of way to say "" thanks for your job"" they usually pick it up drive 5 mins to my playce and that's it, don't want to be rude but i don't feel like giving anything for that.  i asked once what they earn (600 order 1 month) and he is earning as much as me, and even after taxes, fuel, repair costs/maintenance he is at 500-750€ less then me. so if everone tipped 1€ he'd be payed about the same 3600€ brutto 2000€ netto. i think that's quite much for such a job.

now i'm wondering how does this work out for you? was this guy an exception?  are you mad when you don't get tips? i come out of the door and go down to the car to get my food usually i see drivers on the app and i'm already down when they arrive, and i order from onle  2 different restaurants one is 5-8 mins away by car and one 8-12 does this make a difference as it's quite easy? what amount of tips would you expect for those orders specifically and in general assuming 15€ /25€/35€ for the order?

"settling the customer vs driver debate. honest insight from a driver after reading many posts, comments and replies over the months it has frustrated me seeing the animosity and finger pointing going on. ive seen the same circle jerk with these points:

- customers should tip to balance wages
- drivers should just get another job/form a union
- customers shouldnt order if they cant afford it
- uber is at fault and abusing loopholes with the ""independant contractor"" label
- tips are a ""bid"" not gratuity
- gig work is not meant to be full time
- drivers can be horrible and dont deserve better

i could go on but to try keep this as short as possible, this is really the ""truth"". the party at fault is...... the drivers. not all of them, but its mostly us. for customers reading this and arnt aware how the gig works, we get offers from the uber algorhythm, starting at the lowest bid. after x amount of time if no drivers accepts, the bid is raised. if again no one accepts, the offer is re sent higher. there is no limit on this.

us drivers can vouch, this bid has no ceiling because we all have seen a crazy $50 offer that turns out to be a stolen order that is stuck in the endless void of not being accepted and is continutely being re offered higher and higher.

 what does this mean? it means uber is willing to pay us more, but the system calculates how cheap it can offer and still be accepted ... and it gets rewarded. drivers are desperate and/or willing to work for under min wage and ""coach"" the algo to offer a certain amount. if collectively every driver refused orders under set amount, uber will re offer them higher. admittedly its a game of chicken, at what point do i hit accept before another desperate driver will? which probably does need some sort of union/government intervention, but ultimately the only people preventing higher pay today is drivers.


thanks if you read this far, but no its not on the customer or their tips and uber will pay more without legal action needed. drivers just need to try hold strong and uber is forced to offer higher otherwise risk losing a customer/refunding the order. its just difficult when immigrant/desperate drivers are fine earning $5 an hour which continues to enforce the algo.

"what are consequence of ignoring ""please pay $$$ soon""? hi there,

sorry if this is duplicate.

i ordered from ubereats about a month ago and it was delivered to the wrong address (picture provided was not my porch). i tried looking to usual suspects around my address and couldn't find. so i reported through chat. but i was waitlisted, and since i had my kids to take care of i forgot about it. later i learned it wasn't processed and i was charged full amount.

i tried to report this again a few days ago, but ubereats support is being ubereats support. keep disconnecting me saying ""they gave me best resolution"". ????

knowing how frustrating ubereats support is, i just disputed the charge through credit card. now in the app, it says ""please pay $$$ soon"". what would be my consequence of not paying this? i don't want to pay for what i didn't receive, but i also don't want this to be a big problem later on such as impact on credit score. if it just means i don't get to use ubereats anymore, i can take that (i really don't use it unless they have really good promotion anyways).",2025-01-12 16:06:02,4,8,Reddit,UberEats
"customer service so i order some food from a local restaurant and the expected time is about 45 min. i see on the app that the driver has my meal and it is maybe 5 to 10 min to my house. i wait and wait and the app shows they are still sitting there in the parking lot. 

they finally show up at my door after holding my food for over 20 min. now the food is cold. she says her app stopped working and that's why she was late. i had tipped 15% and told her i would be taking that tip back because she delivered cold ass food. she said fine.

i contact customer service from the app and tell them the situation and they offer me about 10 dollars off to be put in my uber cash. ok. that's cool, but i also didn't think she deserved that tip, so i tried canceling it, but the app wouldn't let me because they gave me that 10 dollars.

i wrote to them explaining the circumstances and that i wished to remove the tip. the next day, i got an email telling me thank you for tipping the driver as they took half of the money in my uber cash and gave that to the driver. essentially double tipping for a late order. 

now, most of you are probably drivers and think i'm just a cheap bastard, but i believe tips should be given for exceptional service. if the service is subpar, then a tip should not be given nor expected. i usually tip 15%, and if the service is exceptionally good, i give them another tip with cash in person. but for uber to clown me like that and reward the driver for shoddy service is beyond me.

he was on a live phone call with another person on speaker who kept repeating 'just don't let them cancel, bro just don't let them cancel.' he then drove off.

after a horrid experience with support i was refunded for all except the tip. told them i am not.tipping for no service - they just refused to refund it.

"i can't find this online- i don't understand my earnings report hi, just got done with my first day doing this and something seem off about the numbers

it says   
net fare: $28.11

tips: $40.52

\_\_\_\_

total earnings: $68.63

  
i have no idea what net fare means because my first delivery alone is almost that much. in fact, if i add everything up...

the amounts i take as is coming from uber per order:  
25.19+9.01+8.52+10.54+13.02+2.35 = $68.63

the tips:  
20.92+5.90+4+6+3.35+0.35 = $40.52

the math suggests that my total earnings are my earnings without my tips, but the text suggests that it's my earnings with tips. and this added up the same even before my last 2 of the night. i don't think it's possible that the difference between gross and net could be exactly the same as my tips.

had uber eats disclosed that the name of the place that i was ordering from was actually licensed and operated out of a denny's restaurant i would have saved all of the money that i spent in order from somewhere more reputable.

that said, all the drivers are no longer needed so that sucks for people who rely on that income. however in the future there is the possibility that they could buy an autonomous vehicle and rent it to companies like uber to use while they are at work. interesting maybe if you can afford the investment.

  
i can't help but think uber treats the drivers like crap because they are aggressively trying to replace them with robots anyway. where do you drivers come out on all that? does it piss you off that you can request a waymo on the uber app now? how long do you think before they start delivering food (if they haven't already).

"constructive ""what i wish drivers/customers knew"" thread. if you're disrespectful in the comments i hope the restaurant makes a bad meal so you or your customer are disappointed.  i drive for a food delivery company and order sometimes too. there are things the other side doesn't realize. both being a driver and a customer improves the other's lives. i think we can help each other. 

🍗🍗🍗

customers sometimes don't realize that drivers only get base pay. ~$3 three to four times an hour is $6-8 an hour. the driver pays car payment, maintenance, insurance and registration, fuel, employment insurance and health insurance. different cities have different work avaliable. a tip is not a reward for a job well done it's part of the cost. like in a restaurant if you can't afford a tip you can't afford to eat out/get delivery. 

to make ends meet the driver usually chooses orders that pay $1-2 a mile. so as a customer i take the base pay and add that much to the order and decide if it's worth it to me financially to get delivery. 

also, add more money for heavy items or many items. remember,  these drivers are not covered by their company if they have an on the job injury. 

🚗🚗🚗

drivers sometimes don't realize that customers pay a lot extra for delivery. there is the cost of the delivery (and a service fee?), the food/items are cheaper if you pick it up yourself, sometimes the customer pays for a ""pass"" etc. a lot of them won't realize that a tip is really low, because in restaurants you tip based on the cost of food, not distance + weight/number of items. the customer is paying a lot, don't assume they are intentionally taking advantage you. (not sure how to inform the customer. begging in comments is creepy) 

🍔🍔🍔

when shopping,  customers should put substitutions in if an item isn't in there. stores are frequently out of an item. please also stay near your phone so the driver can get you exactly what you want. every minute they wait is money lost, and sometimes even $1 lost is a really big deal. 

🛒🛒🛒

drivers, please realize that the site is often difficult for the customer. it often says things are in stock that arent, so even when you add substitutions, it takes a minute to figure it out. 

i was super grateful to have a driver bring party decorations because i was very busy cooking and other things. the substitute item wasn't available either and so i had to go back into the site to find another substitute and then change the other item to match that substitute. it took less than a minute for the driver to say ""i'm trying to get this done."" 

i politely said when he arrived ""hey, i just want you to know it hurt when you said _____ i was trying my best"" and he said ""sorry, i regretted how it sounded, i hope you could tell i tried to be extra polite to make up for it."" i appreciated that. i think he felt more chill after he smoked a bowl in the car on the way to dropping it off. the bag reeked 😆😆😆

what would you like to say, politely, to the other person? (save your hate for the corporations that take advantage of both of us)

"same order failed 3 times i’ve placed the same lunch order three times today, and none of them have been delivered. the first driver passed me standing outside my place, then messaged me saying she had an order but it wasn’t mine & there was a system error. the next said it had been delivered but it hadn’t, they told me the driver didn’t follow their guidelines. the third was cancelled as he was picking it up. i contacted customer support several times & no one was helpful, repeatedly telling me they were sorry & would work on it for the future. one person said they would apply a $10 credit as an apology, that didn’t happen. how can they let an order fail three times & not provide some sort of compensation? it’s been almost four hours, i’m starving & very frustrated, and i don’t trust that if i order again this won’t continue to happen. does anyone know if there’s a way of contacting someone about this that isn’t just one of the agents in the app?

"a detailed insight to uber eats abroad after 50 deliveries in poland you must have a local driver's license to use a car for uber eats or any type of application. i only have my american one, so i deliver by bicycle.

total hours online: 55.50 hours
total earned: 719.38 pln / $173.84
per hour: 12.95 pln / $3.13 
deliveries: 50
acceptance rate: 86%
cancellation rate: 0%


when i first started you had absolutely no information about what type of order you were taking, it was literally just a green button: ""accept"", and a small x to cancel.

i complained and in a few days they replied back that they will be implementing the same style as in usa.

the new system doesn't change much anything for bikers. there are so few orders coming in, either you take it or you have nothing.

i have tried two different markets, and sadly they are the same.

the per hour is about half the minimum wage.

i was finally accepted on a different app, glovo and managed 27 pln per hour in my first two hours, so i'm not sure if this is gross or net (i would assume gross amount).

i am hoping it will continue around this rate, the only downside i am still spilling every drink from mcdonalds on the bike and can not get over this fact. i think this app may be more strict than uber, so i'm hoping i will come across a technique that works soon, so i can stop spilling mcdonalds drinks.",2025-01-09 14:49:17,0,2,Reddit,UberEats

"id verification/photo i ordered a 21+ item on uber eats yesterday and the driver said he has been having issues with id verification in app and needed to take a photo of my id (passport).

i asked what the issue was and if we could just try it in the app. he showed me the id verification screen/photo screen and it was in fact not loading. there are sometimes cell service issues in my area.

this is where it gets kinda strange, he takes a second phone and takes a photo of my passport with it and says he’ll input the information manually later. so now he has a photo of my passport on his phone.

then, the uber eats app showed that the delivery was not complete, which i assume is related to issues with id verification? and today i was charged for a cancelation despite receiving the item. (i cleared up the cancelation fee, etc)

i’m confused as to why the delivery didn’t go through and concerned about possible fraud/id theft. are my fears warranted?",2025-01-09 10:38:52,3,11,Reddit,UberEats

"does anyone both drive and order from uber? i do and have some thoughts. warning: long read. hey guys/gals, i'm super curious to see your thoughts.

i'm saving to buy a new house. i picked up a bartending job for supplemental money, but only work two shifts a week tops, so i figured i'd do uber eats as well on the side. i have a full time job as well, but it allows me to work from home for the most part. figured i'd give my thoughts as both a driver and a customer.

**as a customer:**

1. they are easily the worst of all of the three services as far as customer service. they are impossible to get a resolution with, will only give you partial refunds if your food is messed up, have the most absurd wait times, often leave restaurants on there that are closed, etc.

2. they allow the ""tip baiting"" scam that both the drivers and consumers hate. for those of you who don't know, it works like this.

2a. customer orders say 15 bucks in food and leaves a ten dollar tip. the driver is thinking ""man, this is a really nice customer, i'm gonna go out of my way to get this order. 

2b. the driver gets the order and then delivers it super quick, expecting aforementioned tip.

2c. the customer then changes the tip mid order or post order to o.

2d. the result is that you have many of these drivers rushing to get these particular orders and neglecting the others for these big tips to then get $0, creating crazy frustration (fortunately, this is an extreme part time job for me, so it doesn't bug me) because it is their primary source of income (which having driven for two years, i would **never suggest to anyone).**

  
3. i personally never tip before i receive my order. as a server and a bartender, i don't expect a tip until after i receive the service. however, i am providing you with far more service serving/bartending than i am driving. i'm getting fully prepared as if i was for a full time job, explaining the menu to you, making suggestions, making you drinks, am conversing with you, etc. it totally irks me for these drivers in the other forum to compare themselves to servers/bartenders/barbers, etc. it is nowhere near the same. 

4. some of these drivers have such awful attitudes and don't give a crap about anything. for example, i live in a bad neighborhood and people will steal stuff. if it's left out. it's clear in my notes to either call me or leave it on my front porch inside screen door. the mailman can do it and doesn't receive a tip, why can't the person that i'm going to leave a tip for it? over half the time with ue, the drivers will leave stuff outside on sidewalk or forget drinks. it's beyond frustrating.

5. i honestly use doordash and grubhub more than i use uber eats nowadays. customer service is better, drivers care more, you can't ""tip bait"", etc.



**as a driver:**

1. the alcohol orders suck. you will literally have underage kids or people with no id's order 1 or 2 out of 10 times the app takes forever, and living in downtown minneapolis, it sucks for both the customer and the driver to stand outside and have to mess with that app to verify the id/license. you have to then return the item back to the store. you are compensated, but it's not worth the risk, in my opinion. 

  
2. the ""tip baiting"" thing is getting nuts. i get it why the drivers who are really relying on this money get so pissed, but uber isn't gonna change it. **you gotta make changes in your life yourself if you don't like it.** i personally just laugh it off and shake my head. you can't tip bait on doordash or grubhub, so go there if you're gonna keep driving.

3. customers think you get paid wayyyy more than you actually do. i personally do it and will have my bluetooth on car or headphones in and will talk on the phone. when there's down time, i will sit there on my laptop and do stuff. i can wear whatever i want, not shave/shower immediately, get my clothes ready (as if i were for real jobs), etc. **however**, there are seriously times when i've made like 8 bucks an hour driving once you deduct cost of gas. that's not including wear and tear on car, which is why i only do it when extremely bored.

  
4. it's an extremely negative and selfish community. ever driver wants to complain about getting stiffed on tips and only making ""5 bucks an hour,"" but they're never going to bring up the nights they made $50 an hour. like everything in the service business, there are going to be peaks and valleys. however, you have to understand that going into things. 

  
**rant over. just figured i'd share some of my thoughts with you guys being on both sides of things.** ",2025-01-09 01:33:56,0,8,Reddit,UberEats

"do i go inside or wait in the parking lot? i’m new, newbie, just confused on this part, currently finding orders, but it’s just a simple question that i need answered at the moment? 

any feedback is appreciated, thank you!

edit: realizing that i didn’t establish to get orders!
my question, to rephrase is that “do i need to be closer inside or wait in the parking lot for the orders to come in?” not knowing that the app or system of uber is what determines if you get orders. the orange range of getting orders. this is my first time doing it with a family member! thought would be similar to doordash. i’ve been aware of how this works! my bad for phrasing it differently! 

i think i was more curious and a bit worried on being inside of the restaurant or waiting in the parking lot to see if i get an order. (as in if i go inside, are my higher chances to get an order.)

i did speak with another family member who has done this before and they suggested something that they pinned out, was that because we were new, that we might not get as much orders and i think that is what  made it clear to me of why we didn’t get much orders.

we finished delivering and during it, we didn’t get any orders at all!.

anyways, that is what i meant and after today, that is how it went down!

"how do i get my $100 back? i loaded a gift card to my account 6 days ago and immediately attempted to place an order. i've ordered  several times from my account so i had no reason to believe there was any problem. they did ask me to verify my identity, so i went through that whole process and it said i was all set, but when i went to place my order, it said there was a problem and to try again later. and that if the problem persists to contact support. so i waited a bit and tried again, but same issue. i chatted with support and after ""holding"" for quite a while for them to investigate, they said they'd forward the problem and i'd get an email in 6-12 hours.

 not long after, i get an email saying my account is being disabled. after i had just spoken to someone on the phone as well as having just verified my identity, so it makes zero sense that they would deactivate over me asking for help with an issue on their end. but if they don't want my business, fine.

however, my concern is that i have $100 sitting in my account and they will not allow me to use it. 🤬 i've emailed, called, chatted almost every day since the first error, along with trying to place orders via all the various apps and websites owned by uber and it really will not let me place an order. 

has anyone had this issue and is there anything i can do to get my money back? the problem with a charge back is that i bought the gift card with my amazon store card and since i was able to apply the gift card to my uber account, i highly doubt they will help me. is uber seriously resorting to plain old theft to appease their investors now?

"was i too pushy? i just placed an order to a taco chain around three miles from me and immediately got a driver. i was hopeful for a fast delivery, as they were already close to the restaurant at a local mall just across the freeway. 

i waited a good thirty minutes, checked the app and they were still there, in the mall. tried to send a message of, “is everything okay? my map seems to be glitching,” figuring perhaps it was a common glitch i deal with on the app where it doesn’t show driver movements. no answer, another fifteen goes by. i contact uber support twice about their lack of movement, get the usual b.s. and then attempt to cancel my order and still cannot without risk of being charged. 

i am stuck in stasis with my order being held hostage by someone who decided to finish their shopping before bothering with my delivery. 


(before anyone asks, adequate tip, no heavy items, single small in bag drink, one bag tops). 

they finally respond after a 45 minute wait and begin moving. once they arrive at my house they ask me to come down to the street to get it. i am sick, thus why i am ordering no contact delivery. i ask them to please bring it to the door. they seem annoyed but do so. 

even with all that, i still feel guilty for pressing them to deliver. it is nice weather, but cold out and once they actually did start moving they delivered quite quickly. 
was i too pushy in getting them to get moving? 

edit: wow, y’all make the bird site’s piss poor reading comprehension look like a group of peer reviewed academics. the restaurant was not in the mall. 

the driver was in the mall, for forty five minutes, without any communication at all of their own accord. i did not send them there. 

also for those who feel entitled to this information the tip was over 50% ($7.90 on a $13 order).

"we drivers cannot check your bags dear customers, as respectfully as i can ask, please stop sending us messages when we’re at the restaurant or even on our way to the restaurant asking us “can you please make sure the xyz is there? they forgot it last time”. while i feel for you, literally all i can do is ask them if they put it in the bag and then i have to take them at their word. the bag is sealed by the time they give it to me and i can’t open it. and even if i was allowed to physically open the bag to check, i’d never get anywhere by breaking the seals and opening every individual customers bags and inspecting them. 

99.9% of restaurants seal their bags with stickers. those select few who don’t, of course i don’t mind looking. but there’s a lot of misinformation/misconceptions out there about what/how much we drivers can actually do. also contacting us after the delivery (not even sure why or how uber allows this sometimes or how it happens) to tell me about how incompetent i am because i “forgot” whatever burger or sandwich. i didn’t forget it. the restaurant did. i have no way of knowing what’s in the bag or not.

your gripe with this while justified is with the restaurant, not me. while your disapproval is certainly justified, of course you paid for food and should get that exact food exactly how you asked for it, but you’ll have to take it up with them. leave them reviews, that sort of thing. i know it probably still won’t amount to anything but it’s got a better chance than you texting me about it. because the chances of anything being corrected or fixed by that path is absolute zero.

i wait for my order, they call it out and i grab my first persons order, i sit and wait for a second. at this point the manager comes out and points at me, she says “what are you doing?! that food will get cold!” i told her that i am waiting for another order here as they were paired. she didn’t believe me, went back and she got my second order. comes out and says “let me see your phone” i literally hand my phone over because at this point i’ve been waiting awhile, she goes ahead and confirms pickup on both then swipes pickup complete. now the clock is ticking to get to my customers.

she then proceeds to say “i accepted the first order, let me see the second persons order” as she literally just accepted john and doe’s order. i’m ready to leave, i told her this and she gives me this look as if i’m stealing food. 

she said “one moment” goes back with my second persons order, grabs her phone and comes back. takes a photo of both orders with me in the background. she then proceeds to talk spanish with her coworkers. keep in mind i’m about 4 minutes past after i’m supposed to be on the road.

"customers! if your order says meet at door, be there! i just delivered to a person who lives on a dark road. i texted to confirm i was at the right place. they said yes. i let them know i was here. they then texted the color of the door which further confirmed i was at the right place. i go up to the door. i knock. no answer so i text them if they’d prefer i left it because it says meet at door. no answer. how in the world they text back so fast when i’m in my car, but now i’m standing at the door and nothing. i now have to wait 8 minutes for the timer to run out so i can take a picture!
so, if ever you’re wondering why the delivery person is “just standing there” it’s likely because you chose “meet at door” and they are waiting for the timer to let them leave it.",2025-01-07 22:08:28,151,133,Reddit,UberEats

"is anyone else’s uberone broken? i noticed since late last week i have been getting charged for delivery fees from places i always order from restaurants that are uberone and have been a member for a couple years already. 

i reached out to support, they had the audacity to tell me to my face that the places i ordered from didn’t have the uberone logo - i screen shotted it and shut them up real quick. long story short, they don’t have any idea what’s wrong so i’m curious if anyone else here has the same issues. 

there’s no uberone option in any of my menus to even manage my membership anymore which is weird, they definitely took my membership money and at least the agent could confirm that my membership is active. tried reinstalling the app but nothing changed. found some old threads of people having the same issue with no resolution. any thoughts? perhaps a software issue on their end?",2025-01-07 18:28:08,2,9,Reddit,UberEats

i picked up a two part delivery from the beer store. the uber app took me into the middle of nowhere to an abandoned power plant. superrrr sketchy. if i was alone in the car, i would’ve immediately driven away. this indian dude waved us up to the building and we walked up to the door to see dozens of shoes laying all over the place. the man was friendly enough, but the entire building smelt like weed and meth. 

i looked up the building after we left and sure enough it’s been for sale for 4.5 million dollars for over 2 years now. i’m 100% sure we delivered to a giant group of indian squatters living in this building.

"one of the most odd/worst experiences i’ve ever had starting this by painting a little picture. i live in a suburban area in florida and was ordering this food to a quite large 40,000sqft building i work at. 

one day i decided to uber eats myself some moes for lunch. just chips, queso, quesadilla and moes is about 10-12 minutes from me. order gets picked up and the driver starts heading in the opposite direction of me. i didn’t pay for priority but still a minor annoyance because food and go from good to just okay when waiting to long but overall nbd. (not even sure why uber eats let’s me track the driver when there not on my turn) anyways i see the delivery driver get to a neighborhood and stop so i’m assuming they made there first location. 5min go by and still there, then 10min, then 15min… i’m now getting annoying and concerned because something happened to the driver and my order is just slowing frosting. i message the driver “is everything okay?”. 5 more minutes go by and they respond “yes. i’m in the way.” great so no issue i’m getting my food but doing quick math in my head i’m not seeing this food for 40-50 minutes after it was picked up. only a short 15 min drive for them now soon i’ll atleast have my food soon right? 

it’s taken them over the 15 min drive it should have but maybe there was traffic. with how poorly this has gone so far i’m going to help out by waiting outside the building for them. now there’s two entrance to the building. one at the very start and one at the very end of the building. i’m looking for there car and see it. going 10 under trying to find the entrance. they miss the first one. i wave thinking they saw me. they miss the second one?? now the only way to get back to the entrance is to go down, uturn, then comeback and uturn again. 5 minutes later i’m still standing outside, more near the road now. i see them creeping even slower. cars backing up behind them so slow. they turn in to early and it doesnt connect to my parking lot. but they notice! quickly turn around and pull into my correct area as i’m waiving them down! my food finally! 

i see a man driving in the front, no one in the passenger seat and a grown women in the back. i walk up and say my name. they speak near no english but give a nod with look of concern. the women hops out of the backseat with bag of food from village inn!?! i got moes. the women speaks maybe 10% english and i get from her that the app messed up and brought me the wrong order?? they offer me the village in but i’m not interested in that or whatever it may contain. while they’re trying to understand what i’m saying the women makes a phone call to some random man who i can tell is also spanish but speaks english much better. they hand the phone to me and it was somebody who was managing there uber eats account for them. i’m never seen anything like that in my life. why’s this women sitting in the backseat alone? why’s there an account manager?  he’s trying to explain the app messed up and what do i want to do. at this point just cancel it. i asked them to cancel it on there end so i can hopefully get a refund. i’m trying to contact support on my end but have to talk to a bot that gives me generic “your driver is close! give them time to find you!” finally get through to a human. they contact my delivery driver and we got it cancelled. i get a we’re sorry refund of $10 off my next order. 

i order uber eats a lot. i really try to be patient and help the drivers out when i can but this what something that nearly put me over the edge. 

tldr: uber eats driver took roughly 50minutes to get to me by sitting in some random neighborhood for 20 minutes. finally got to me and missed my turn twice, while i was outside. they brought me the wrong food. the spoke no english and called someone that was managing there account for them that spoke english. uber all messed it up and wasn’t there fault? i finally just got it canceled. uber eats gave me $10 coupon for my $20 order as a we’re sorry.

i ran out of some essential groceries and determined i would face the cold snap of 10 degrees with a -20 windchill. got up, stepped outside, my glasses fogged and frosted within 90 seconds. came back inside.

4 hours later, it warmed a bit and i managed to make it to my car, clear the 1 inch of ice from the windows, hit the grocery store, and return home. 

the roads? not too bad.

the sidewalks and parking lots? oh, hell. pure glare ice!

"can you block drivers? i just had the craziest thing happen. my food was stolen in the most disgusting way possible, and i'm not eligible for a refund??

i ordered a lot of comfort food after fasting for 3 days, so it was a lot of money.

the driver came up to my house, told me the doorbell is broken. i told him i'm coming down and i did. i ran down and in that moment, he called me. i didn't bring my phone, but it was literally 20 seconds. he wasn't in sight.

when i came up, i got to know that he called me and i can't call back, because ""this driver only uses chat"". i told him how to get to the door (go around the building) and he told me he was waiting for me. no information at all from him.

my delivery notes always say that the entrance is at the back.

he then marked the whole thing as delivered and took a photo of the door he was standing next to. and left.

only at that point i knew where was actually standing. he went to the building next to mine. a building which has the entrance at the front. ffs. i mentioned multiple times in the conversation with him to go to the back and he didn't figure out that he was at the wrong place? (+ the delivery notes btw)

i thought maybe he would leave the order where he made the picture, but nope. there was a small ledge under a roof he could have used. i guess not even that much lol. i guess having more food is better than having less food right? only if you actually pay for it. f.uck that guy. (""you may not have f.uck in the post body"" lol - what is this sub about, praising ubereats? or for 5-year-olds how can't see curse words?)

i called him 2 times after that. because... ubereats shows the driver's phone after delivery even if they ""only use chat""? what? xd (he didn't pick up of course)

i have another question in addition to the one in the title - can anyone that knows tell me, what does rating the driver do? does it do anything?

"ubereats does not refund fully for food poisoning i ordered 3 items from a restaurant, and had to throw up 10 minutes into eating. uber support says i am only eligible for refund on the first item that caused me problems. 

this is logically inconsistent. either you assume no food poisoning, refusing all refunds, or you assume all items are compromised, refunding all. partial refund is implying only one item is problematic, when all 3 items are burritos made at the same time. 

there is of course the probability that maybe only one item was problematic. however, has anyone ever gotten food poisoning and thought ""hmm let's gamble on the others!"" that is what uber eats expects you to do, gamble on your health.

on nye me and my wife drove eats. had some fun. all up and down clearwater. was trying to get the second quest bonus. at about 9p i get a double request, pick up at a sushi joint then head over to a pizza place. it took about 5mins to get to sushi place then another 5mins to get to pizza place. that's about 10mins total. when i get to pizza place, pizza had just been put in the oven. the manager, only person on duty because they were about to close, asks, ""did you park in a parking space?"" no, i just parked at the front door, the lot is completely empty, all other businesses are closed. the dude then tells me if i want the pizza i have to park in a spot. i reminded him he shouldn't have requested a driver unless the food was actually ready. then he's all, ""ok, this time i'll let it slide. but next time you have to park in a spot."" then he tells me, ""it's gonna be another 5mins. while you wait, go ahead and park in a parking spot. by the time you get back it'll be ready."" no problem, bro. i requested a cancel for excessive wait time and left. forget his pizza, forget his restaurant, forget his parking spot insane rules. good job 5 star pizza. probably did the customer a favor, saving them from trash pizza.

"screwed by uber eats when delivering i'm so pissed i worked for uber eats and they sent me to pick up groceries from walmart. i sat there for a half hour and they canceled the order there were three orders in one but i was doing the pay by active time so i didn't care that i had to wait ..but..they won't pay me anything. then i get another one and i'm already sitting there so i take it same thing happens. what is with this getting stuck with spark grocery orders as an uber eats driver and then getting screwed again by them never paying me for it.
after contacting support they tell me that they will give me $3 i freaking lost it. i'm over it with them. does anyone else have this issue with them. i'm pretty new at it but i don't think i'm going to do uber eats anymore. i think walmart sends for uber and if one of their own spark people take it they screwed the uber driver.

"new company allows drivers to bid on restaurant deliveries themselves instead of choosing deliveries based on tip amounts that can be revoked ok ok...company doesn't exist as far as im aware.

i just used the company uship to move a chest across country. i posted a description of the chest, its dimensions, location and some other relevant info. then a bunch of offers came flooding in. the first ones were super pricy...after a while i found a driver who offered a very reasonable price and he has great reviews so i booked him.

  
now imagine we are talking about a food  delivery. i post the restaurant (honestly the price of the order is irrelevant really), it's location, my location, and the time that the order will be ready. then drivers could throw out a price that they would be willing to accept to deliver the food. 

  
the driver accepts tips of course for following through in a timely fashion. there would also be a fee paid to the parent company. in the case of uship the fee was $25 on a $250 move. so on a $50 restaurant order it might be like $5? 10% of the total bid?

  
as an ubereats/doordash/whatever other company driver would you add this to your list of apps? there would obviously have to be some timing issues worked out but the idea is that the customer would order directly through the restaurant and then immediately arrange for the delivery (either while paying if the restaurant was a participant or via an app otherwise).

why wouldn't a driver notify the customer? hey the store is closed. 

 because then the next driver wastes their time, goes there, and then drives off and then another driver, and another driver. over and over again. the first driver basically f*s everyone over. ",2025-01-05 01:08:28,57,68,Reddit,UberEats

"uber eats do not give a fck about their customers!!!! hello. i have spent a lot of money on both uber ride services and uber eats, however i have noticed that they absolutely do not care about customer satisfaction at all. i recently made a specialty restaurant order from a popular fast food chain. i ordered my food a very specific way and paid a lot of extra money for that. the restaurant didn't care. they completely disregarded everything that i paid extra for and sent it to me the standard way. when i tried to reach uder eats customer service through the app i realized that there was no way to request a refund or contact a customer service agent. so i looked up the telephone number on google. when i did get in contact with a real human. it was obvious that even though they were human it was still like dealing with a computer program, they just read some bs from a script and after i told them what the issue was they request to put me on hold, then came back and said that they could not offer me a refund be they were not a person that was authorized to do things like that, (more lies and bs) so they told me that i would receive an email from their team for a resolution to my problem within 48 hours, (more lies and bs) never received an email so i  called back and the customer service agent stated that the team just needs a little more time to review my request ( again with more lies and bs) then when i called the next day the customer service agent said. i'm sorry but we cannot offer you a  refund. 
i said what do you mean?! i ordered my food with extra things on it and i actually have pictures of the food that i received and it's very clearly wrong and the items i paid extra for aren't on my food!!! he just gave me another fake apology and another line of bs and asked if there was anything else that he could help me with. so i will be filing a complaint with the bbb, the ftc, and my states attorney generals office about this matter. i also will never use any uber services from now on. i will use alternative sources unless those sources are unavailable. but this company has lost my business.

okay some of you lazy ass genz people commenting on my post are complete morons. oooh the entitlement!!! it's called customer service you twitts. if your lazy dooless asses actually did your fckn job right then i wouldn't be having an issue with it. but instead of you taking responsibility for the fact that you are too lazy to do your job correctly. do you like paying a bunch of your money for shitty service? and pay money for things that you don't receive. i guess i'm supposed to be happy about it instead of pissed. and you're a bunch of fckn hypocrites, because ive seen the temper tantrums you guys have when someone gets your latte wrong so gfy!!!

update you peckerhead twitts!!!
used doordash, andtonight! different fast food chain.
ordered my food the way i fckn wanted it from burger king. 
got my food the way i ordered it.
everything was perfect!!!
so mysterious be that the restaurant and the dasher all took pride in doing a great job. gave my dasher a huge tip.

"uber eats bans refunds. & a little payback  recently, i found out ue placed a restriction on my account, banning me from ever getting a refund from them.
the order(s) i wanted a compensation for was 2.5+ hrs late, and the bundled extra order never arrived. after much stalling by uber, and much misinformation, i was told that if you ask for a refund more than uber wants to payout, they will put a restriction on your account, making it impossible to ever get a refund again.
now, i have never made a false claim, and almost never requested refunds. i did however rate the service honestly each time i ordered, and normally it was substandard. cold food, damaged food, missing food or ridiculously late delivery seem to be the norm. 

so, here is what i have done. i have setup an old cell phone with voip auto-dial software, made it deaf, dumb & blind, and am using it to call the customer service line nonstop. i have done the math and i have already cost them more than what they owed me, but i will continue just to make a point.
simply closing your account and not using the service isn’t enough, they are exploitative and constantly getting around regulations. i suggest anyone who feels as i do, rig up a similar system.
btw it is also easy to obtain a pseudo-account & voip #.

***

so, here is an update. after using the above method to call ubereats endlessly for weeks (and setting me email to auto reply to their emails) uber refunded me and gave a credit for the inconvenience. 
this is for an order i was told countless times wasn’t eligible for a refund.

"can we stop calling it a ""tip""? jfc a tip is a sum of money customarily given by a customer to someone for the service they have performed, in addition to the basic price of the service.



the key point here is ""for the service they have performed"". 

  
'tipping"" in advance of the service that is expected to be performed is not tipping. it is payment for the service you desire. it is not a tip. it is simply the customer bidding on the service that they desire because the company (uber in this case) is too cheap to pay their employees a live-able wage. 

  
i think everyone would be better served if instead of referring to it as a tip, it was called a ""bid"" or similar to convey the reality of the situation. ie...if you do not bid on the service, or if you bid an unacceptable amount...no one will perform the service on your behalf. 



then, once the service has been performed the customer would have the option to add a ""tip"" for a job well done...if in fact it was done well.

"uber eats is the biggest scammer  i had a really frustrating experience with uber eats that i wanted to share and see if anyone else has dealt with something similar.

on january 1st, i placed a grocery order and scheduled it for delivery today, january 3rd. the total was $43 for 11 items, and i applied a 40% promotion coupon, which they charged me for.

however, when my delivery day arrived, most of the expensive items i ordered were marked as “out of stock.” now, i’m only getting 6 items for $30. these items aren’t even worth that much—i could’ve easily gotten them for around $15 elsewhere.

on top of that, uber eats somehow removed the 40% promotion from my order without notifying me. so now, i’m paying significantly more for fewer items.

when i contacted customer service, they asked for proof, like a screenshot of the original receipt. the issue is that they’ve updated the receipt in the app to reflect only the 6 items, and they didn’t email me the initial receipt, which i could’ve used as proof.

i even offered to share a screenshot of my bank statement showing the $43 charge to demonstrate that there’s no way 6 items could’ve totaled that amount without the promotion, but they just won’t listen.

has anyone else dealt with this? any tips on how to get uber eats to resolve this issue? i feel like i’m being overcharged, and it’s incredibly unfair.

so, i contacted uber support through the help chat, and they responded by saying that i’ve violated their ""terms and conditions,"" which is why my uber cash isn't working. honestly, i have no idea what they’re talking about—i've been using uber for years, including just last month when i traveled abroad with no issues. i even have a 5-star rating.

i’ve messaged them multiple times (like 5+), but they keep sending the same copy-paste response with no real help.

is this really how they handle things? i have $50 in uber cash that i can’t access, and i feel stuck. it’s frustrating, especially with how hard money is to come by these days.

has anyone else experienced this? any advice or suggestions on how i can resolve this? i'm honestly at a loss.

"uber is a scammer 
be it uber eats or uber drive, it is a pathetic excuse of a company. 
no customer service. no response. no refunds even if no services provided. as if they are above all rules and regulations. 
been on all sides of it. as a rider, a driver , uber eats customer, uber eats driver. they screw everyone. they charge full fees to customers for cancellation and pay almost to nothing to drivers. they allow tip baiting blatantly. for a long time they made drivers drive for long pick ups, shitty rides, manipulated them to accept every ride to “have a good acceptance rate” just so they could win rights to see their destination. yes most riders didn’t know this but uber didn’t allow drivers to see the destination they were heading to. like forced slavery, they would only know the destination after picking up the rider and because most drivers are good human beings and didn’t want to ask someone to get out of the car because the destination wasn’t profitable, far from their home and pushed on them without a choice, they would simply complete the ride and customers didn’t believe that drivers never had the option to choose because choosing meant low acceptance, less rides and even lesser choice. then the tips which uber takes away, i have seen it happen too many times. my earnings would be higher and when i check next they would be “adjusted” because it’s an app they play around and change the payments. at first i thought i was going crazy then i started making notes and noticed the discrepancy. your number of rides, deliveries get missing. 
they take advantage by creating fake stresses so drivers do not notice how many runs they made. 
i had to call customer service several times to get my rides and deliveries back in records so uber doesn’t eat away my hard earned money.
uber is evil incarnate. uber eats is shittier. i was using my car, my insurance, my hours, waiting for orders to get ready, collecting, delivering them and then being tip baited, while i spend 30 mins to 1 hour for a delivery only for my pay to be snatched back out. imagine driving 15 kms in snow/rain, spending 45 mins waiting, collecting and hand delivering orders pleasantly to receive $4.50? what are we fools? my gas, my car, car maintenance, my time and effort for what to lose money? in the end you have to realise that you lose with uber. they exploit you only so they could get richer and exploit more others. get out of this crap cycle of exploitation asap.",2025-01-01 19:58:02,24,22,Reddit,UberEats

"we should bring back paying at the door for food deliveries i am a person who works often from area to area frequently and i don't always have the time to go to the restaurant myself or cook sometimes, so usually during work i order food and my experience lately has been miserable, perhaps it's the location or whatever but it's just been a repeating pattern now wherever i go.

we should bring back the option to pay at the door with card or ~~cash~~ for food deliveries. restaurants and delivery drivers have gotten too comfortable making mistakes when customers aren’t there to verify the order. paying at the door would add accountability in my opinion so that orders are correct and delivered responsibly.

if this system is implemented well, and if the person doesn't pay upon delivery then there will be an additional fee the next time an order is made through the app. of course delivery drivers should be compensated in situations where customer refuses to pay.

edi:  
i get the concerns about safety and logistics, but paying at the door can still work if it’s done right. instead of cash, contactless card payments (as i stated above) can be used to avoid robbery risks, and pre-authorization holds can guarantee payment before delivery, so drivers aren’t stuck if someone refuses to pay. phones today have card readers which makes payments quick and easy without needing exact change. reviews and ratings don’t fix problems in the moment, and even issues happen emergently regardless if they're rated high. anyways this isn’t about going backward it’s about adding accountability and options.",2025-01-01 12:57:13,0,19,Reddit,UberEats

we ordered our food and the online order through there website has the order put in, we get the food and items are missing, whole portions were not delivered, and on top of it all teh receipt does not even match the order.

we then go to uber and put in the issue and they want a picture of the missing item - what? and then they want a picture of the receipt - the oe that does not match the online order?, and then they come back with their is no issue and the delivery matches the recipt - what? none of this makes sense, especially when my bank accoutn shows the amount charged to match the online order not teh receipt.

when are we going to stop using these services that always seem to screw us, then pay us only a portion back, and on top of that do not care that somoen did not get the food and will not get to eat!! i am thinking of reaching out to all communities and getting a classa ction suit against uber and doordash - i am sure we are not the only family that this has happened to and often!!!!

"exploitation of workers and the role of customers & government tl;dr — this post challenges the use of the term “gig”, used by corporations to mask the exploitation of its “independent contractors”



the term “gig” has become synonymous with flexible, short-term work arrangements often facilitated by app-based platforms such as uber, doordash, and instacart. while this term may evoke a sense of freedom or casual engagement, it conceals a stark reality: corporate exploitation of workers labeled as “independent contractors.” this terminology is intentionally crafted to absolve corporations of traditional employer responsibilities, enabling them to shift the burden of costs and risks onto workers while reaping the rewards of their labor.

one glaring inequity lies in the tax burden shouldered by gig workers. unlike w-2 employees, who split payroll taxes with their employers, gig workers are classified as self-employed and thus pay the full 15.3% self-employment tax. this is in addition to federal and state income taxes. a 2022 study by the economic policy institute found that gig workers, on average, face a higher effective tax rate than w-2 employees, despite earning significantly less. these workers are also responsible for tracking, filing, and paying taxes on their earnings—tasks traditionally handled by employers for w-2 employees.

furthermore, gig workers bear the costs of tools essential to their jobs. for drivers and couriers, this includes fuel, vehicle maintenance, insurance, depreciation, and wear and tear. according to the american automobile association (aaa), the average cost of owning and operating a vehicle in the u.s. in 2023 was $12,182 annually, or roughly $0.81 per mile. these expenses are rarely, if ever, compensated by gig platforms. a recent survey by ridester revealed that rideshare drivers earn an average of $15.73 per hour after expenses, far below the minimum wage in many states when adjusted for costs.

this exploitation is rooted in corporate greed, as platforms intentionally skirt labor laws to maximize profits. gig workers receive none of the protections afforded to employees, such as health insurance, paid time off, or unemployment benefits. meanwhile, companies pocket substantial profits by externalizing these costs.

consumers play a pivotal role in this system, often unaware of the financial and physical toll borne by gig workers. many balk at tipping, perceiving it as optional rather than essential. however, tips are a critical part of gig workers’ income, directly affecting their ability to cover expenses and sustain their livelihoods. if consumers object to tipping, their frustration should be directed not at the workers but at the corporations exploiting them.

the government provides no meaningful tax relief or benefits to gig workers, despite their unique financial burdens. this systemic neglect underscores the need for public awareness and action. by supporting gig workers through fair tipping practices and advocating for legislative changes, consumers can help dismantle this exploitative system.

the word “gig” is a euphemism masking corporate exploitation. to ensure equity, the public must recognize these realities and hold corporations accountable for their unethical practices.",2024-12-29 22:49:37,5,1,Reddit,UberEats

it’s the weirdest offer because i’ve never done rides and i get the feeling it’s something to do with that because it wouldn’t be showing me the customers rating but then the whole it just shows me driving to them and not where i’m supposed to go from there and it also doesn’t show a price so i don’t even know what i would be accepting not that i’m gonna cause i don’t do rides, but i’m curious if anyone’s ever gotten those. you know we can sometimes see the customer on gps now when we’re pulling up to their house it’s got that same little set up for the place they’re telling you they want you to drive. 

but considering you have no idea what you’re agreeing to and the fact that i’ve never had rides turned on i’m curious if this is some kind of a system error because i get them all the time sometimes multiple times a day

"total went up from final order total after order was delivered? so i had an order delivered yesterday of groceries and have been charged more than the order total was at checkout.

1. **initial total:** when i placed the order, the total was £48.31 after discounts and delivery adjustments. i was then charged £48.31, which was correct.
2. **refunds for missing items:** two items were unavailable during shopping and refunded. after the order arrived, another item (the ginsters steak slice) was missing.
3. **unexpected price increase:** despite these refunds, my final charge increased to £55.37.

i’ve also noticed that some discounted items (like coleslaw and hash browns from the ""save on party food and cocktails"" category) were no longer showing as discounted on the receipt. when i placed the order, they were discounted, and it appears the discount was removed after i checked out.

additionally, i made sure to meet the £60 spending requirement for the £15 discount promotion, but the receipt states i spent £72. this does not align with my original total or the items i ordered.

**summary of issues:**

* i was charged more (£55.37) than my original checkout total (£48.31), even with missing/refunded items.
* discounts that applied at checkout seem to have been removed after the order was placed.

"uber eats delivery tried to open my door  i ordered some delivery tonight. the moment the driver was on his way, i sent him a message informing him my outside light was burnt out and explicit instructions on how to reach me. he got lost and i saw him out my window looking for me. i messaged to look for flashing lights and i flashed my inside lights. 

it works and he dropped of my order. and then wouldn’t leave. he told me he was here so i said thank you and to leave it at the door. after a couple minutes he was still there so i said again, can you please just leave it at the door. then he tried to turn my doorknob and push the door open. i messaged him again and was like please leave, i’m not coming down to greet you. with my light being out i wouldn’t be able to see anything out there. 

i watched him head down the stairs and stop, waiting for a few more minutes. finally he left. i reported him right away but i’m curious what happens on his end as the driver?

edit: crazy to me that apparently a dark doorway gives anyone the green light to attempt entry. i’m sorry i didn’t have a replacement bulb, or a six foot ladder to immediately replace the bulb and you’re right, i guess that means i deserve what’s coming right? 😒 ",2024-12-29 00:38:16,667,795,Reddit,UberEats

i contacted support to help reach the first customer, but the delivery location was in a building where the customer came down to meet me, so i couldn’t access their apartment or contact them directly. support informed me that they could only email the customer and not call them. oddly enough, they were able to call the customer after the order was delivered.

fast forward to today—i checked my credit card statement and saw i got charged a cancellation fee. and not just any fee—it was as much as the damn order itself! i canceled it within five seconds, and i only canceled because they told me to!

when i contacted them about a refund, they refused, saying i didn’t dispute the charge within 48 hours. like, wtf? at no point did they tell me this “48-hour rule.” how am i supposed to know i need to follow up again for a refund when i was following their instructions?

oh, and the best part? no phone number to actually talk to someone. they just hide behind automated replies and canned responses. it honestly feels like they’re just scamming people out of money with these shady cancellation fees.

	2.	naturally, i reported this to uber eats support, expecting a refund for the mistake. seems reasonable, right?

	3.	to my shock, i was told my order is “ineligible” for a refund. when i asked for an explanation, i kept getting the same vague response about being ineligible based on the information provided.

	4.	i requested to speak with a supervisor or someone else who could help, but the support agent ended the chat.

	5.	i tried again with a different agent, only to receive the same unhelpful response.

	6.	when i mentioned if could dispute the charge with my bank as a last resort, i was threatened with having my account banned!

i called uber to let them know this customer was not being honest, but i just kept getting transferred from one agent to another, none of whom i could actually understand (for added context, i am hard of hearing; phone conversations are difficult enough to begin with, but heavy accents make it impossible to make out 95% of what is being said).

"drivers very much appreciate your tip! dear customers of ubereats, dd, gh…

drivers are working for your tips.  

drivers do not receive any extra pay from any of these delivery services for:  

1. waiting for an order.
2. contacting you with options for a        substitution when the menu (or shopping item) is out of stock.
3. getting stuck in rush hour traffic or redirects due to road work.
4. taking extra time to find your address when your street or building number is not posted or the gps pin is not accurate.  
5. trying to find the correct delivery entrance  in the dark because pathway and entrance lights are off.
6. driving extra miles because the delivery address is off or the mileage estimated by the delivery service is off.
7. dealing with issues with support when there is a problem.  

there is usually a $2 base fee that is paid to the driver by the delivery service you selected.  all of those other fees you pay?  we don’t see them.  

the driver experiences the same type of frustration that you do when dealing with support especially when there is an unresolved problem.  

please remember your driver is working out of their own pocket as a 1099 contractor before you place your order.

please remember your driver post delivery. when items 1-7 happen, they are working out of pocket to take care of you.  

drivers very much appreciate their customers.

anyway. i watched on the app for the driver as he got close and as it said arriving now, i went to meet the driver at the door

no one came to the door. i had my phone in my hand and silent was turned off so all calls would come through. nothing. i keep checking the app and it shows the car is on my street a little bit further up. i look around and nothing. i walk to the edge of my garden and i don’t immediately see anyone 

after about 3 minutes i start ringing the uber eats support line because the driver never even texted me their number. as i’m waiting to connect i notice a car about 3 houses up suddenly turn its light on (didn’t hear anyone open or close a car door) and speed off down the road

i eventually got through to customer support. they informed that the driver had attempted to contact me (i have no messages or missed calls) and that after this he left the delivery outside my house (i was stood at my front door for 5 minutes and there’s nothing here)

apparently he even sent a photo to prove it was delivered to my house. i asked and they said there was no house number so apparently he’s placed it on the door step of some random house 

i was informed that because the driver followed proper procedure and that the food going missing after delivery is not their liability, they will not be giving me a refund

i made a report online and got the same almost automated response. 

i sent a follow up email fully explaining everything. that i have zero messages or calls to my phone despite the details being correct and used for previous deliveries, that i was at my front door the entire time and no one approached my property and that it looks like they had tried to go to a completely wrong address because of the car speeding off at that time

i got a response from a human this time who said they sympathised with my situation but reiterated that everything aligned with the uber eats policy and after a review there is still nothing they can do

so i’m now £30 out of pocket and i and my flatmate had to go hungry for the rest of that day until 6pm because we spent our lunch breaks from remote work ordering food and messing about on the support line

"i just had the weirdest experience and i'm not sure if i was being scammed or something. did i handle this okay? i ordered lunch on uber around 11:30. it said it would arrive at 12:15. at 12:30 it still wasn't there and i checked the app. it said the drive was 5 minutes away. i noticed he was in the parking lot of a local deli that isn't between my house and where i ordered lunch from. odd, but maybe he took a wrong turn. 


5 minutes goes by and i check the app. it now says 6 minutes away but he's still at the deli. 


6 minutes pass and he hasn't moved. he's either getting himself lunch or stole my food. i called twice but the call wouldn't go through.


when a total of 40 minutes go by i called the owner of the deli because we happen to be friends. she says he's sitting there in his car but never came in. okay, so he stole my food. i called uber and let them know what happen. they try to call him but also say he's unreachable. they apologized and refund the order. i found stuff at home to cook. i thought it was done. 


just shy of an hour later the doorbell rings and it's the driver with the food! through the ring doorbell i tell him to just leave it on the porch. i didn't feel comfortable opening the door at this point and didn't know what else to say. he says ""okay."" but then walks away with the food. i think it's really weird to hold someone's food for an hour and 40 minutes and then suddenly bring it, especially since the order was cancelled. and i think it's even weirder that he did it and still took it back? but wait. there's more. 


another hour after that the doorbell rings again. it's him. with our food. he says something i can't really understand. something about ""i delivered your food and [audio cut out] so i'm delivering it again."" i told him again to leave it outside. he did this time and walked away. 


another thing to note is from what i can tell from looking out the windows, i think he parked somewhere on the street or in the parking lot behind my house because he cut through between my neighbor's houses. he'd been here earlier so he knew which house was mine (he walked around the block that time but i thought maybe uber's map gave bad directions)and there's plenty of parking directly in front. so why park out of the way like that? 


i took the food and right now it's on the counter. i hate wasting food but this situation is so sketchy i don't feel comfortable eating it or giving it to anyone else to eat. it was panera bread so everything is in packaging that could easily be opened and closed again. he has the food for all those hours.

"buy 1 get 1 free - how often do they offer this?  i ordered uber eats for the first time a few days ago, with a buy 1 get 1 free offer, from a restaurant, and picked up the order myself. this was a positive experience overall.

how often do they provide these offers, or am i unlikely to be offered this again, as i will, in all likelihood, only use ubereats if this offer is available? 

i calculated delivery options, and it seemed (my opinion) very pricey, even before a tip, even with this offer. plus, having read many delivery horror stories in this forum, picking up my own food seemed like a better option, as i am able to do so. 

i realize some are unable to go pick up their own food, for a variety of health concerns. i am fortunate.

with pickup, even though the prices were inflated (roughly $2 higher for each item than if ordering directly from the restaurant), the 2 for 1 offer still made it a good deal. 

  
i looked again today at the same restaurant and i don't see that 2 for 1 offer available anymore.

"updates on uber’s $200m investor settlement over its ipo scandal hey guys, i posted about the settlement already, but in case you missed it, and since we have some updates, i decided to post it again. it’s about the controversy uber had over its ipo a few years ago.

here’s a quick recap: in 2019, uber went public, raising over $8.1 billion. but, by august of that year, revenue grew by just 2%, while expenses surged by $507m. unsurprisingly, this caused $uber shares to plummet by over 20%, and investors filed lawsuits for it.

now, uber has decided to resolve these claims and pay a $200m settlement. and the good thing is that i just found out that even though the deadline has passed, you can still [submit a claim here](https://11thestate.com/cases/uber-investor-settlement). 

so, if you were affected back then, you can check the details and file your claim here or through the settlement administrator.

here are the delivery instructions i provide:
building xxx / apt nnn / nth floor
please ring the doorbell.

"the uber eats satisfaction rate is wrong uber eats really needs to fix the satisfaction rate system because it, totally, works against you. let me explain. let's just say you completed 100 trips/deliveries. a big majority of the ""satisfied"" customers do not give you a review. so, let's say out of that 100 trips/delivers, 6 people decide to give you a negative review. that puts you at 94% satisfactory rate, under the 95% satisfactory rate we all aim to stay at.

this get worse because just to make up for that -6% to get back to 95% we need to deliver 100 more times with positive reviews from every customer to get back to a 100%. i think it's more like 112 good reviews to get back to 100%. the problem here is that satisfied customers hardly give a review for your delivery. they almost always give a review if they are dissatisfied.

solution: customers who do not complain or give a negative review should be considered as a positive review so it does not affect your rating. the customers that don't give a negative review should be deemed as positive and should reflect that in our satisfaction rate, otherwise, our satisfaction rate will always be against us because it takes only 1 disgruntled customer to put our rating down to 1 to 2 percent. then we need hundreds of good reviews to make up for that negative rating. the thing is, 90+ % of customers don't even give reviews.

it makes no sense to me that if a customer gives me 1 negative review that i need to do 50-100 or more deliveries with good reviews to make up for 1% or 2%.

so, we all been getting screwed by this system since day 1. i hope you all know what i'm saying. i try to say diamond. i get one bad review and my rating gets super low. but, then i thought about this.... like wait... 90% of the people i deliver don't give me a review or rating at all. how is this fair? it's not even close to accurate.

many of you have fallen to this deception including myself that you're just not doing a good job. you actually are. the problem is that uber eats does not take in to account the 90% of customers you deliver to that leave reviews.

that 10% or less give or take will leave a bad review if they are dissatisfied almost all the time.

to give you a perfect example, i've done a few hundred deliveries, maybe a thousand or so. for me to get back to 95% satisfaction rate i would need about 200 good reviews even thought i only have 3 bad reviews out of my total deliveries. that's because out of those thousand deliveries only about 5% actually gave me a review. of course, the upset people gave me a bad review which was 3 total for whatever reason.

that system gets worse because you can deliver another 100 trips and get no reviews but 1 bad review and your rating tanks.

"don’t let support deny you compensation for a stolen order i got a good offer tonight. $10 for 4.4 miles. it was at a very busy chick-fil-a so there was a bit of a wait. after about 5-10 minutes the manager told me they don’t have the order, it was already picked up by someone else. sigh. so i called support to cancel and asked for compensation. the first agent told me they’re not able to process compensation. i knew that was bs so i asked for a supervisor. she actually listened to me and paid me the full fare that was offered.

don’t let the first agent try to tell you you’re not eligible for compensation. that’s a lie that uber tells them to say in hopes that drivers will give up and accept nothing. if you escalate the issue you will get the money you deserve.",2024-12-23 22:18:53,41,8,Reddit,UberEats

item missing from order but got a card that said to contact support since they didn't have it in stock. i was denied a refund? i'm so confused i ordered some things and 2 items on the list weren't in stock so they sent a card letting me know to contact support. i provided a picture of it and got instantly denied. called there number and waited 30 minutes only to hear that because it says not eligible they can't help. so i asked them over the phone if they felt that was correct even though i literally have a card from the store saying they didn't have it and to contact support. he said he felt it was wrong but he couldn't do anything. asked for a supervisor got the same response. i guess i'm having to file a claim through my bank and never using them again this seems insane to me. i've barely used them and paid for uber one for years.,2024-12-23 21:57:17,5,16,Reddit,UberEats
"unfair uber eats charge for undelivered order from pholicious in virginia hey everyone,

i wanted to share an unpleasant experience i had with uber eats and the restaurant pholicious in virginia earlier today (december 23, 2024). i’m hoping for some advice or similar experiences from this community.

# what happened:

i placed an order via uber eats for chicken pho with chicken broth from pholicious. as an indian who doesn’t eat other types of meat, this choice was very intentional. the restaurant accepted the order, and everything seemed fine.

however, the delivery person, vasant kumar, called me later to say the restaurant didn’t have chicken broth and was offering beef broth instead, which i cannot consume. i asked both the delivery person and the restaurant to cancel the order since they couldn’t fulfill it as requested.

# the issue:

* the delivery person told me to cancel the order myself and then hung up without resolving the issue.
* when i contacted uber eats support, they informed me that the order was canceled but charged me around $18 to compensate the restaurant and the delivery person.
* they justified this by saying the cancellation occurred after the restaurant accepted the order. however, the inability to fulfill the order was entirely the restaurant’s fault, not mine.

# additional attempts:

i even called pholicious directly, but they said they couldn’t do anything since the order was placed through uber eats.

# why this is frustrating:

i didn’t receive anything, and yet i was charged for a service that wasn’t delivered due to the restaurant’s inability to provide what they promised. uber eats support refused to process a refund despite explaining the situation multiple times.

# question for the community:

has anyone faced something similar? how did you resolve it? i believe this charge is unfair and violates basic consumer rights. any advice or guidance would be greatly appreciated!

thanks in advance, and i hope this post helps others who might encounter similar issues.",2024-12-23 20:25:54,0,15,Reddit,UberEats

"driver talking on phone outside instead of delivering my food?? so i placed an order over an hour ago, food didn’t get close to my house for 30-40 minutes which is understandable, i live in a busy city and traffic can get bad but once he got to my parking lot of my apartment (parking lot is right outside my bedroom window) i saw him park and get out of his car, lean against his car for 3-4 minutes on his phone, then answer a phone call and talk to a friend for about 8 more minutes, i finally got upset enough to message him asking if everything’s okay and he said he got lost and he will be there shortly… then he grabbed the food out of his car and delivered it within a minute, i’m very upset hy this because my food is cold and stale at this point and the ice in my drink is almost completely gone :( i never get mad when my foods a big cold due to traffic or whatever but him blatantly neglecting to walk for a minute to bring me my food is very upsetting. will uber do anything about this if i talk to support? 

edit: i didn’t get up and grab my food because 1. that’s not really initially expected of me when i order through that app, like i’d have no problem doing it if someone asked i guess but he wasn’t making an active effort to deliver the food at all, it’s not hard to talk on the phone and carry a bag with two small things in it at the same time, i don’t care that he was on the phone it’s that he was talking about a trip he’s gonna take soon (or something like that) and 2. im having an endometrial flare up right now and i get very close to bedridden for a few days during it, and i have to deal with that until my surgery for it. so walking isn’t really an easy task for me at the moment or else i would’ve driven to get the food myself like i usually do. my post was just wondering if i can let uber know what happened through the support questions or not, i don’t want a refund or to get the guy fired i just think it’s unprofessional to do that. it’s my first day off work in 8 days and i just wanted food from my favorite spot.

"nervous encounter with huge dog made a delivery last night and there was this dog that was very huge that i don't think i've ever seen one that big. pause.

i was walking so slowly anticipating that it might attack at any moment. i finally got in the car and the dog came close to the car and looked at me as if to say 'get the hell out of here'

"a “driver strike” or any other plans that we come up with here will serve no benefit i legitimately cannot wrap my mind around how people do not understand this concept. this subreddit has 167,426 members. as of q3 2024 there are around 1,000,000 drivers for uber eats in the united states. i only ever see at max 500 people active here, so even if every single person in the subreddit who is actively checking up on it decided to strike, would that really make any difference? people who strike would immediately be replaced by people who don’t care about terrible pay.

i really don’t want to sound like a pessimist but it’s sad to see posts about “uber offered me $2 to drive 8 miles this should be illegal!” everytime i look at this subreddit. i’m just as frustrated as everyone else with the garbage pay but unfortunately it’s not illegal and complaining won’t help, and a “strike” won’t do much of anything, at least not one organized on reddit",2024-12-23 01:16:33,5,27,Reddit,UberEats

"ordered pick up, ended up without the order and can't get a refund...  i ordered to pick up food at kfc because i have covid. the person at drive through was really rude and demanded i go inside.  

i did, and had my four year old in person pj's and sick too. and everyone was rude, i asked for the order and then they argued it wasnt ready and someone from the back came forward and seemed like they were almost coming up to be combative. and everyone in the back was laughing ...  it was all around weird and i felt uncomfortable so i left and went to my car. i couldn't figure out how to cancel... the manager came out and i said please cancel it, due to the hostile environment id rather go somewhere else and not eat here. he said ok and went inside.

i spoke with uber each customer service multiple times everyone kept just like disconnecting the chat, basically saying the store has to cancel the order.  so i called the store and was like you guys need to cancel the order.  they told me i needed to call kfc customer service, and that they had no ability to do that yet at that moment they completed the order saying i picked it up.  

which was an hour after the incident occurred at that point. 

basically they get to keep the money i don't have food or the money and i can't figure out what to do next... uber eats literally basically told me to f myself.  if i didn't have my daughter i would have stayed and dealt with the childish kids in kfc but i felt very uncomfortable... at the point of me leaving there's three kfc employees around me and my daughter... it was just weird. 

anyways, any ideas on how to get my money back? uber eats i'm convinced at this point- is trash as a driver and super trash as a customer now.  i'm going to cancel both apps but want my money back first.  ",2024-12-22 23:50:53,3,27,Reddit,UberEats

"uber deducts tips for orders that were never delivered and makes you spend it only on their platform how is this business practice by uber legal?

tl;dr : i place an order with uber. uber never deliveres it because it's inconvenient for them. and then charges me money that i now have to spend with them and cannot get it back! and when i ask about this, support clams up, invents a story and tells me it's somehow my fault and quickly shuts down the chat?!

i had placed an order this afternoon. the delivery person had trouble finding the apartment despite multiple phone calls, chats and directions. then the order was suddenly marked as delivered - it wasn't. i checked. i reported this within 30s of the order missing. the app connected me with the driver who told me clearly that :

1. he still had the food with him
2. the uber app had redirected him to another delivery and that i should contact support for a refund.

the app makes you run through multiple hoops - telling you that you should contact the driver for several minutes before it allowed me to get a refund. as frustrated as i was to not get the food i ordered, having to make other arrangements and at having to deal with the app and refunds, i was still ok that i got the refund. i thought that was the end of it - right? no.

an hour later, i get an email about a tip being deducted from my credit card. what tip?!  the order was never delivered - under the explicit instructions of uber to the driver and now uber has the audacity to deduct a tip?!

i reached out to their customer care and they tell me that they can only refund tips as uber cash. so i now need to spend that money with uber. as i am talking about this with customer care, the support person tells me the tip was deducted because i reported the issue an hour late - even though i have evidence that the refund email came in within minutes! \* then they very very quickly cut off the chat.\*

i reinitiated the chat and the 2nd support person also tells me that they can't do anything and cut off the chat as well. the strangest part of all : there is a question that appears in chat asking 'have we resolved your question' and there is no way to answer that - the chat has somehow disabled my ability to answer that!

this is sooooo shady! how is this not illegal?

if we assume, with some generosity of spirit that only 1% of uber eats orders are not delivered and that a $2 tip is deducted and made to spend on the platform, then :

\* number of orders on uber eats per year : 2 billion (very conservative estimate - it was 1.7b in 2021 so by now, it's more than 2b)

\* 1% of that not delivered : 20 mn orders (i bet it's a lot more than 1% based on the orders i've had trouble with)

\* $2 tip that is forcibly deducted : $40 million !!!

assuming that everyone who gets a tip deducted for an undelivered order immediately requests a refund, that's $40 mn that you are forced to spend with uber even though you didn't get the service you asked for!

how are there not consumer protection laws against this sort of shady practice?! each individual customer might find it hard to justify a lawsuit for $2 but boy is uber skimming!",2024-12-22 20:47:24,1,4,Reddit,UberEats
"customers, please meet your driver if that's what you asked for. i've been burned before like this. you could've asked for drop off, 'leave outside'. thought it'd go without saying but it's happened so often i don't know if people do it on accident but i just have trust issues after what happened...

the customer that tried to burn me-  customer asks to meet, doesn't answer door for minutes... look at their meeting instructions and they say leave on the bench, do not knock or ring, don't call. (seemed sus but i got tired of waiting for a response)

so i leave it like they asked, assuming the best in people, it was also a really nice neighborhood. 10 minutes later i'm hit with a missed delivery message from uber explaining possible repercussions, i immediately called support to set this straight. they were totally understanding and said it wouldn't count against me. support actually shared this is a common practice they experience during the holidays but they saw my gps going right up to the door and wait a couple of minutes so they said no problem i'm good. they could see her meeting instructions asking me to leave it (despite asking to meet) and supported called it a ""scam"". wasn't expecting them to be so honest and upfront this happens often but i appreciated it. just a little precaution tale.

"2025 driver general advice the new year is upon us. with it comes many challenges, opportunities, blessings, and drama out the wazoo.

here's a quick list of things i would suggest for drivers. take it or leave it. it applies to some, but not all.

1. **have a thermal bag?** if not, maybe consider getting one. ue shop recently dropped the prices on bags from $40 to $12. [https://ubereatsshop.com/](https://ubereatsshop.com/) temu, ebay, amazon, and restaurant supply sites also sell cheap ones as well as less cheap high-quality bags.
2. **always in a rush?** slow down. learn to relax. take a breath. seriously, speeding isn't worth the ticket - or a crash. being rude or impatient with restaurant employees won't speed anything up. so try to chill out a bit.
3. **avoid fire lane parking.** even with all the branding and flashers on, you risk ruining your income by getting a $50-$150 ticket for 5 mins in a red zone. watch out for fire hydrants and yellow zones as well. most states have a 10-15 feet in either direction rule.
4. **pizza time!?** be prepared for a 10-30 min wait. if you don't want to wait, don't take pizza deliveries.
5. **upside isn't worth it.** seriously, every fuel station they link to is 20-50 cents higher than your local discount fuel stop that is never listed with upside. unless you're convinced buying ""premium brand"" gasoline is the only option.
6. **5 seconds.** huh? if you ever turn right on red, wherever it's allowed, always completely stop for 5 seconds. even with people behind you honking, count out 1. 2. 3. 4. 5... then go. cameras are watching every intersection these days, even when you don't see the camera. right turn on red will 75% of the time result in a ticket if you do not completely stop behind the white line at the red.
7. **don't tailgate.** no, i'm not talking about picnics at sporting events. in short - if you cannot see the wheels on the car in front of you, you're too close. if you cannot see pavement beneath the car in front of you, back off. fewer accidents = more bank.
8. **deodorant. antiperspirant**. ***not*** body spray. the first two keep you from being *pepe le pe*w, the third one only lasts about 10 mins, then nothing the rest of the day. customers and restaurant employees will appreciate you not smelling sweaty.
9. **phone in your face!** stop shoving your phone screen in the faces of employees at pickup locations. unless they ask you to see the screen. i've heard so many complaints and received so much gratitude for not doing that unless they ask to see the screen.
10. **verify in front of them.** verify the order on your screen at the pickup location. make a point of ensuring someone hears the delivery pickup chime sound. with so much theft, having them get used to hearing the chime or seeing the pickup complete bar slider go black will help deter theft on our end.

"can i get my money back & how do i stop this? hi so i don't know how i got here but i subscribed to uberone over a year go. now for some reason, i lost all my uberone perks out of the blue about 10-11 months ago. turns out, i only just realized that they have still been charging me every month for the last 10-11 months for uber one which i've never even been able to use because it says i don't have it anymore and i've been having to pay delivery fees on every single order for the past year - including on restaurants that were always 0 delivery fee back when my uber one did work. if i didn't check my bank statement on the exact date/time that it came out, i probably still wouldn't have known because i assumed my membership ended when i wasn't receiving the benefits and when i looked on my profile around 8 months ago it says i didn't have uberone. now, it shows that i still do and it was probably my fault for not checking my bank statement properly as i never really need to - i just check the balance and if it adds up (which it always has) then i'm fine and i know i have some other subscriptions (amazon prime / youtube premium / spotify premium / discord nitro etc)

  
my question is how in the actual \[bleep\] do i go about contacting ubereats support over this and can i get my money back for each month they charged me seeing as they kept charging me without actually giving me any uberone benefits at all or am i entirely at fault for not cancelling a membership i didn't think i had and it didn't show i had when i originally checked it the first time i saw i wasn't getting benefits because they stopped giving me all the benefits out of the blue.

"i want to get into doing deliveries in my town specifically, but there is a problem that makes me wonder if it's even possible. should i just look for a part time job or is there something i can do about my town basically being nonexistent on the app? i live in a very small town in canada called durham(not the region this town has roughly 2700 people), so it's so small, that on google maps, it says i could walk from one end of the bulk of the town to the other in roughly thirty minutes, which means that biking is the perfect thing for making deliveries here. from what i understand, this town has a high population of older folk, so i'm sure there would be business, there's a relatively well sized grocery store, some convenience stores, multiple places to get takeout and such. but there is a problem, i'm not very knowledgeable about these kinds of things, so i want to see if someone can help me understand if this is a hopeless endeavor or not.

1. on the ubereats app, there isn't a single store in my town available, is that because no one works here? or this town is too small to be viable for such a service?

"fudge you, ubereats, and goodbye forever  today is my last day of using ubereats. i’m officially done. i’ve been using ubereats on and off for the past 6 years. the app and customer service has seriously declined recently in my experience. i recently got food poisoning from popeyes and they refused to give me a refund. threw the rest of the food out since i only ate partially. i found hair in another order and they refused to give me a refund. i threw out the food immediately after discovering hair which was before i ate the food thankfully. another restaurant messed up my order and still no partial refund. today was the final straw. i ordered and the restaurant didn’t have what i wanted. ubereats still charged me and refused to refund. i’m done. i will go to doordash now 😂",2024-12-21 23:37:11,0,8,Reddit,UberEats

i know it would be crowded with christmas shoppers, so i didn't worry about time.

"blame ubereats, the restaurant, or the delivery guy? definitely ubereats.  i clicked on ""within 30 minutes"" and once i ordered, with priority delivery, they showed a delivery time 45 minutes later (the minimum delivery time)

then the app showed a delivery guy on a bicycle many blocks away as the pick up guy.  the app showed him sitting and sitting a block away while my food was 'being prepared'.

it is now an hour since i've ordered, he finally picked it up and he's still over 15 minutes away.

i'll still tip him $10, because it's cold out, but i won't tip him more because i'm hangry.

drivers, is this delay not his fault?  (i know part of it is ubereats, but the app showed him as far away when he accepted the delivery, and then showed him sitting over a block away for at least 5 minutes)

edit: based on the comments, i'm guessing the delivery guy had a pickup prior to mine and that was why his location was static for so long.  so, it seems that even if priority delivery of my food happens directly after pickup, the pickup itself can be delayed.  tldr: seems that priority doesn't guarantee hot food, delivered quickly",2024-12-21 18:14:54,0,11,Reddit,UberEats

i have contact delivery off because i have dogs who love people so i prefer for my food to be left. it’s a hit or miss. whatever i’m used to it. 

my husband was on a call for something so when i got a notification the food was delivered i normally wait to see the photo and wait for them to leave. i saw that photos was of our food on our sidewalk. not our front door area. whatever it’s still like 2 feet away. i looked out the peep hole and saw no one and no car so i was like. cool he left. my little nonsober butt opened the door and was greeted with the driver holding my food in the corner in the  dark out of the view of our peephole and our porch light. the guy stood there staring at me for a few seconds and only reached out to hand me the food after he saw my husband coming behind me and he ran off. 

am i just over reacting for thinking it was weird af??

edit: yes it was off my account so my name was on the order, the photo was literally a zoomed in blurry af photo of his feet, sidewalk and our food. i waited a few minutes like 2-4 minutes after marked as delivered and saw the photo so yeah it scared me to see him when i thought he left. he never messaged about waiting or knocked or even rang the doorbell.

then it improved after awhile and at least for frequent customers, you could reach someone by chat or phone and they actually stepped in to help.

in the last half a year or so, i noticed that customer service seemed to have disappeared.  case in point, i had an order that was supposed to take 20 minutes, and it ended up taking 1.5 hours (well over the latest estimated delivery).  

now late hours, happens, etc.  but what was crazy is that the customer service was basically non-existence when i tried to reach out multiple times.  the chat agent, even though it had been 15 lates past latest estimate (i.e. 1.3 hours in my wait) just pasted canned response about weather and other fact and how delivery is estimate.  refused to help in any other way.

phone agent tried to reach driver and then basically said sorry nothing we can do except look into.

"cancelled uberone because of ue i’m used to having some issues, whether it’s doordash, instacart, skip, or ue. but those other companies take way better care of customers.

the final straw? i ordered three subs from subway. all three were missing toppings, and mine was loaded with onions which i specifically removed from the order. 

all of this is subway’s fault of course, but ue’s solution? a $5 credit. not even a refund. i responded saying my sub alone was $13 and i couldn’t eat any of it because it was loaded with onions. this is in addition to my kids’ subs missing ingredients. nope, they wouldn’t budge. i tried four times and they stuck to their bullshit $5. 

i was about to pay for a yearly subscription, but instead i cancelled. it costs way too much to get food that has issues, and if you’re not going to make things right, you lose my business. in comparison, doordash has refunded the entire amount before when something similar occurred.",2024-12-18 14:42:33,11,7,Reddit,UberEats

"experienced doordasher new to ue. some questions.. so at the moment, i’m rely on gig driving for my main income. with doordash, having the ability to work any time i wanted was critical. thus i have to maintain 70% acceptance rate, which is often a real pain in the ass, and means taking a lot of crap orders i’d rather not. 

i decided to try multi-apping with ue. i’ve done 100+ deliveries on ue. also i’m not activated for rides, only ubereats. some questions:
 
1. does acceptance rate really not matter on ue? i get a notice when going online that my acceptance rate is lower than average in my area. but does this affect the value of offers you receive at all, like with dd (who claims you get better paying offers at higher ar)?

i’ve dug around the app awhile and i cant really see any penalty described for low ar, or better rewards for a higher one. only satisfaction rate and cancellation rate seem important for perks, but acceptance rate doesn’t seem to matter. is this accurate?

it’s been so mentally freeing to turn down crappy offers and waiting for better ones, without worrying about acceptance rate screwing myself overall. i hope that’s true. 

2. why do i only get partial pay (of the advertised offer pay) after completing delivery, and the rest comes in later? does ue like withhold tips temporarily until the customer indicates everything was good? i get tons of “tip was added” notifications like hours later after driving. there’s no way those are all customers actually adding more tip at that time… it happens just way too frequently. on dd, i have a customer add additional tip after delivery once per blue moon, or if i went above and beyond. on ue, it’s raining notifications of tip added. so i have to think these aren’t “real” but are the just the tips i’ve already earned, finally being released to me. is that right?

at any rate, it’s awkward to not know how much i fully made until like an hour or more after stopping. 

3. with doordash, it takes some extra taps, but you can see all the customer(s) addess(es) of an order as soon as you’ve accepted it. on ue, i cant find any place to see the customer address until after pickup is completed. is it true there is no way to?

4. looking at my balance log, it’s mostly “delivery” entries, but there’s also a lot of “fare adjustment” lines. it’s always +pay so i’m not complaining, but what are they?

5. when an offer comes in with the tag “exclusive” what does that mean? my only guess is that at the moment, it’s an offer shown to me only, versus ones that get offered to a crowd and first tap gets it? 

6. doordash initially offers better paying orders to new drivers for like a week or 2 to entice. does ue do anything like that? should i worry my quality or frequency of offers will decline later, especially with a lower ar? or that i’ll get less exclusives, etc?

thanks!",2024-12-18 14:05:00,1,4,Reddit,UberEats
"don’t ignore your driver!  if you’re gonna use the service, don’t ignore your driver. i just had to cancel a trip, because the restaurant was out of the drink that the customer wanted, and they refused to answer, texts or calls asking what the replacement is. i cannot just leave without the drink, because i’m not risking getting reported for not bringing the drink, because you didn’t wanna respond to texts or calls. i get it if you’re at work, but be prepared to at least send a thumbs up or respond to issues. soooo frustrating. i can’t sit at the restaurant for 10 minutes trying to call you several times and have you not only hang up on me, but ignore my request for your replacement.

"driver here: my unusual delay story i didn't tell the customer this because i didn't think they'd appreciate or believe the reason.  i think the delay was only about 5 minutes, and the customer didn't reduce my tip, so it's all good.

my trip took me to a small town i'd never been to. as i approach an intersection, i see 4 children at the top of a hill out of the corner of my eye (hooray for adhd). the children are all different ages, and they are waving their arms wildly. 

my first thought was that they were just waving at traffic and being silly, but my second thought was that they were siblings and they might be trying to get help.

so i pulled into a church parking lot and called 911. since i didn't know the town, i struggled to describe where i'd seen them.  then i saw a cop car driving in that direction and told the 911 operator. she put me on hold and contacted that cop then got back to me and said the officer saw the children. whew.

"i’m an uber eats driver, and we hate it as much as y’all do this is my first post here (i think. if it isn’t, the actual first one was so long ago i don’t remember) this is sort of a response to the customer who made a post complaining about drivers taking multi stop orders, but will also address other things.

first let me say i’m only doing this because i’m waiting to take my texas cna exams at the end of this month and the beginning of next month, after which i’m going to work at a facility. this is my stopgap income. i have no illusions about being my own boss, making my own hours or any of that. i tried doing it full time doing uber rides back from 2020 to 2022. i won’t do that now because i don’t have a dashcam, i’ve since come out as trans (and am living visibly as that) and in texas especially i’m scared half to everloving death of having strangers in my car. and so food deliveries it is.

the truth is, i really resonate with y’all. a lot. i read this sub semi often, and everything y’all say makes perfect sense. the thing is, some (not all) of you blame the wrong entity. a lot of the stuff people complain about here is not our fault, and we couldn’t control it if we wanted to. i am more than happy to admit my mistakes. for example, i once went back to a restaurant to pick up a customers drink after having delivered his food, despite his insistence that he didn’t expect me to do that. to me it was the right thing, and i even had to pay for a new drink with my own money, because the restaurant said they’d thrown the old one away, so a new one would have to be paid for. it was my mistake, so i did it.

the multi order issue is one us drivers have complained about for a long time, mostly because the app gives us very little control in how we handle it. i’ll give you a real life example that happened to me last week:

i was picking up from a restaurant, and while i was waiting for the food, i got another ping, for another restaurant across the street, and then going in the same direction to deliver as the first. the order happened to be a milkshake, but the app made no point to let me know this before i accepted it. i could only access the second order after having picked up the first. at that point, i saw it was ice cream, but since it was going in the same direction, i (stupidly) assumed uber would have me deliver that one first. but after i confirmed that pickup, it had me deliver the other order first.

there is no way to change the delivery order on the ue app. it’s one of the things i like about doordash, but i won’t dd anymore, because they won’t let me change my display name that customers see on the app unless i update it legally (which i’m about to do anyway). and that causes a safety issue for me. uber and lyft both did it no problem when i asked them, because they understand they retain my legal info. and if the customer calls in a complaint about me, they can connect the name they give with the delivery, and trace it to my legal info they have on file. there is no skirting going on here, but that was dds argument for the refusal. as such i no longer deliver for them. so i don’t multiapp, and even when i did, i did it differently than i’ve seen some other people say. i’d have both apps on until an order came in on one. if i liked that order i accepted it and paused requests on the other app.

we get tip baited. we have people put a higher tip they have no intention in following through on so they can get their food faster, and then take most or all of the tip away the second they get their food. that was another thing i liked about dd, you get the entire pay for the order as soon as you deliver it, including the tip.

i don’t mean to make that sound like it’s most of you because i know it isn’t. but it happens enough that it’s incredibly frustrating and makes me almost not want to take orders with really good tips, because i wonder if it might be too good to be true.

the multi orders, yeah it’s a real problem. mostly because uber is screwing us both, but they’re using smoke and mirrors so that customers will be upset with us and not them. i had a guy once think i should have a nicer car because uber drivers are quote “rolling in money”. lol is all i can say to that.

usually, most but not all multi orders are because one of them tipped really bad or didn’t tip at all. uber can then lower the base pay for both orders, leaving the one generous tip to essentially cover the cost of both orders.

take this as an example. let’s say uber base pay is $2. customer 1 tips $10. customer 2 doesn’t tip at all. if they’re relatively in close proximity uber can now group both orders together as one stacked $12-14 dollar order. because if they don’t do that, they have to raise the base pay for the no tip order to get a driver to actually take it. it’s much easier (and cheaper) for them to simply toss it onto the back end of an order that actually tipped well, and then move it to the front of the delivery stack after the driver accepts. which means 95% of our income from those 2 deliveries came from one generous customer.

which means at that point, you as the generous tipper essentially just paid for a complete strangers delivery. why? because uber didn’t want to, and that’s the only reason they need to screw folks.

people pay exorbitant uber service fees. we never see those. people pay restaurant fees. we never see those. they put higher tips in hopes of getting their food faster, and they still don’t because then uber has to group them in with some other person who didn’t tip, because uber still wants that order delivered.

you have your 15 dollar order. then you pay a 7 dollar uber fee, a 6 dollar restaurant fee, and a 6 dollar delivery fee (which we don’t get despite the name). you’re now at 34 dollars for a burger and some fries. 10 dollar tip to ensure you get it in a timely manner? now you’re at 44 dollars. except joe rain over here who didn’t tip and happens to live around the same area as you. his order gets put on with yours, and then for whatever stupid reason uber makes us bring him his food first. your 44 dollar burger and fries now arrive 40 minutes late, cold and stale. now ask uber execs if they care. i’d bet dollars to donuts your driver does. we just can’t do a dang thing about it.

when it was structured as more of an actual bidding system, it worked better. pay more to get your food faster, the customer and the driver are both happy. but uber is trying to cater to non-tippers, because they make up a substantial percentage of the delivery market. because of that, generous tippers get punished. this discourages people from tipping, or encourages them to tip less, resulting in drivers not wanting to take those orders, so they get lumped in with people who still tip, rinse and repeat and the cycle continues.

base pay should be base pay. any tips should be on top of that. base pay should not be able to be arbitrarily taken down because someone tipped well. and then to group you in with someone who didn’t on top of it because that person still wants their food, and uber still wants them to have it, but not badly enough to actually pay us well, so you, the generous tipper still have to wait. so the other person (whose order your generous tip basically paid for) can get their food too, and often times even before you get yours.

virtually everything i see people complain about on this sub affects us drivers negatively as well. we’re just as upset about it as you are. some of us, both drivers and customers, are woken up to the fact that the real enemy is uber and their greed. but still, their tactics result mostly in drivers being upset at customers, and customers being upset with drivers, and not nearly enough people on either side looking at them like we should be.

i go through hell, i can’t find apartments, people give bad directions, i deliver in the rain, i spend several minutes trying to get ahold of someone who didn’t list their gate code, only for them to yell at me when i finally get ahold of them because they insist they listed it, and i have to physically show them that they didn’t.

i’ve had people not even list their apartment number. i’ve had people ask me to order something else for them that they forgot to order, promising they’d add it to their tip, and then they didn’t. (that one i learned the hard way and don’t do it anymore. because often not only do they not factor it into the tip, often those are ones who tipped very low in the first place or not at all)

they tell me to please get extra of whatever sauces because they couldn’t find it on the app. the restaurant charges for those usually, then they get mad when i didn’t do it.

i go out of my way to provide good customer service as much as i can, even things i’m not required by uber to do, like still trying to contact the customer even after the waiting clock expires, or going back to the restaurant to pick up something i forgot.

added into all this is shop & pay as well. people use uber eats to buy stuff from tom thumb for example, and then i have to go in and shop for all this stuff and pay for it with my uber card.

and since i brought that up, here’s another example:

i was near tomb thumb and got an order for alcohol to rockwall. so i go into th and get it. literally as i’m checking out, another order comes in, also from this th, also going to rockwall it says. so i accept. it’s a 50 lb bag of dog food. i ask the lady if she can hold the alcohol i already paid for and i’d be right back. i go get the dog food and come back to the front and check out. after i check out it tells me to bring the dog food first. and get this, it wasn’t rockwall. it’s princeton. princeton is nowhere near rockwall, and considerably past rockwall from where i am. which means either the app lied to get me to take it (i wouldn’t put it past them) or more likely, that order got dropped and replaced with a new one. uber felt no need to ask me, because since i already was taking 2 orders, surely i must’ve been ok with a different second order.

there is no way to change the delivery order if the app is dead wrong on efficiency, and it is a lot. so rockwall alcohol had to wait (rhyme unintended). 

they were gracious about it but some people aren’t. we have very little if any control over the algorithm or how this app does things. we see very little if any relevant information before we accept orders, and even less relevant information for the 2nd and 3rd orders of stacked orders before we accept them.

and again, uber does this to screw us and you, so we can both be pointing fingers at each other instead of them.

the same thing that happened with the milk shake, i had that same thing happen with 4 bags of ice from 7/11 the night before.

ue doesn’t care, as long as they get their money. they really don’t even care if the customers are happy. as long as the customers are mad at the drivers and not ue themselves, they’re perfectly ok with it.

please understand we’re humans too, and just trying to make a living and keep our bills paid, just like you. please understand for most of us nothing we do is meant to slight you, and we often know how terrible it is, don’t agree with it, and are forced into doing it anyway, because the app ties our hands from doing it a better way. please understand we are just as frustrated with these greedy money hungry losers and this stupid dumb as all heck system as y’all all are. 

i can’t wait til i can take my exams and start working as a cna and be done with this app for good. i might still do it, but it will be few and far between if i’m just that bored. it for sure won’t be nearly full time like i am now.

if we work together we can fix it. but as long as we’re mad at each other like they want us to be, it will never change.

for the record, uber rides does exactly the same thing. you paid 60 dollars for a ride? the driver might see 25 of that on a good day. but you paid 60 dollars for a ride, and you might think the driver got most of that, and now you’re under this impression that drivers are “rolling in it” so you don’t tip, and the driver is also mad at you because you didn’t tip on a 35 mile 48 minute ride. uber stole money from you under the guise that the driver is getting most of it, and then just kept it. but now y’all are mad at each other, and the execs laugh all the way to the bank.

all i’m saying is please direct your displeasure to the appropriate parties. because i promise you we hate it out here as much as you all do. most of us just don’t have any other choice if we want to actually eat today.",2024-12-18 05:17:01,20,45,Reddit,UberEats
"how hard is it to cancel an order? first off, as a driver, thanks to everyone using ue and double thanks to the ones that tip. 

in some instances it's better (*) for either the customer or the driver to have the customer cancel an order. obviously with communication (text/call) to explain the situation and why a customer cancel could be in your interest. but i figured most customers don't seem to have an easy option to cancel their order and most end up having to call support to cancel from their end. since i've never ordered food online, i'd love to know how hard uber makes it for customers to cancel an order.




*why it might benefit you or your driver:
you: if the restaurant is closed, i'll try to have you cancel and reorder from an open restaurant again. if i'd cancel for ""restaurant closed"" your order will be given to multiple other drivers, one after another, before the system has enough driver cancellations for ""restaurant closed"" to believe us. this will increase your wait time dramatically and still ends with your order cancelled anyway. if you cancel yourself, you can just order from another open restaurant right away and have minimal delay in when you can finally eat.
similar with shop & pay when an important item is sold out, or most/all of your items are sold out. if we cancel, other drivers will be sent to the same store, one after another, until the system believes us that your 3 of 3 items are actually out of stock. or worse, another driver delivers you 1 bottle of gatorade but not the 9 sold out medicine or food items that you actually placed the order for. so you end up with high fees for a gatorade bottle and have to order the other items from a different store again.
us: in most regions (luckily not mine), canceling for closed restaurants, or for all shop & pay items out of stock, etc. counts towards our cancellation rate. this is basically the most important metric for us drivers since a high cancellation rate (15-25%? depending on region?) will result in a deactivation of our account. if the customer cancels it doesn't count towards our cancellation rate.

"grubhub lawsuit - your thoughts on this? #grubhub to pay $25 million for misleading customers, restaurants, drivers

(reuters) -grubhub settled with the u.s. federal trade commission and illinois attorney general kwame raoul on tuesday for allegedly misleading customers about order fees, adding restaurants to its platform without their consent and deceiving drivers about pay.

the settlement requires grubhub to cease the practices and pay $25 million. the agencies sought a $140 million judgment against the company, but reduced it to what grubhub is able to pay, they said. if grubhub is found to have misrepresented its financial position, the full penalty will apply.

a grubhub spokesperson said on tuesday that, ""while we categorically deny the allegations made by the ftc, many of which are wrong, misleading or no longer applicable to our business, we believe settling this matter is in the best interest of grubhub and allows us to move forward.""

the food delivery platform hid fees until the last minute, misled grubhub+ subscribers to believe they can avoid fees, and blocked some customers from using their gift card balances, according to the lawsuit.
**drivers were told they could earn up to $26 an hour, when in reality only the top 2% achieved those rates**, the agencies said. and thousands of restaurants were added to the platform without their consent, resulting in order delays and customer complaints, the ftc and illinois said.

""for grubhub, these misrepresentations are a quick and cheap way to add restaurant offerings and build scale. but grubhub’s deception harms restaurants and diners alike,"" the agencies said.

the ftc and illinois alleged the practices violated federal and state law.

"apple uses uber to ""courier"" - buyer beware \*\*\* this is not a slam against uber drivers\*\*\* 

i ordered a new laptop to replace my dying computer. i saw the option to have it couriered for the same cost as parking at the mall and thought, great! i can keep working and avoid traffic... well, then i get a text from the original ""courier"" saing my laptop was ""stolen"" then he said it was picked up by someone else. after an hour on the phone with corporate they finally let me talk to the store - the store shows that it was indeed picked up by another person. while he commiserated with me that it's awful apple uses uber and feels terrible it's not explicit on the site, that once they hand over the item it is no longer apple's concern and uber is now liable. to which i said, well... if it gets stolen then i'm out $1400 because uber won't be paying that. we were on a conference call with the apple rep and she said she will launch and investigation if it is not delivered in the time frame (we'll see). i went out to my door to wait for it at the new scheduled drop-off and suddenly tracking says it's been canceled. i call back apple and they say the driver gives no reason but says they returned item to store ... i make them connect me with the store again. i speak with the same employee, he said he handles all inventory and nothing has been placed in his hands... but if the system says returned then at the very least i won't have to fight for my refund it \*should\* be automatic. all this to save myself a trip. wasted 90 minutes on the phone with apple and never even got the laptop.

it is wild to me that apple use uber for couriered deliveries instead of vetted couriersand does not explicitly inform consumers at time of purchase. the store employee said they have put internal feedback with no avail and that they would never trust the system as a consumer. and yet, there are reddit posts going back years about this. i'm going to dispute the charge ahead of waiting for a refund but i had to put this out there as a warning to others.

"missing items + horrible non-existent customer service... been having issues with multiple recent orders where the driver (or resto) forgets one or multiple items.  

when you used to have a missing or wrong item in the order, the app would let you report it and then refund you the cost of that item. simple and easy. i still don't get my missing item but whatever, i get it.

but now, they direct you to a customer service chat that takes 1-3 biz days to get back. 90% of the time, they give a auto-response asking for the receipt and a photo of the order (dumb, because isn't that on the dang app already...) anyway, after your provide that, another auto-response:

>""after looking into this order and the information provided, it was determined that the delivery matches the order. therefore this order can't be refunded.

no matter what counter i give: ""item was clearly not even in the delivery photo"" / ""took a photo upon receiving order and clearly no item""/ ""order doesn't match the receipt i clearly sent"" ...it'll be the same auto-response and they'll automatically close the ticket. every time... even if like 1/3 of the cost of the order is missing, no resolution at all from ubereats.

plus, you used to be able to call an actual person on the phone (800-253-9377) but they've since removed that channel and feed it all through support chat with international call center agents now.

don't know how much $ i've lost now with this issue. cancelled my uberone 'cause of how bad the customer service has gotten... anyone have any luck getting refunds for issues like this?

sometimes, you just want to grab a bite without scrolling endlessly through options that are way out of your price range. it’d be super convenient if we could just type in the amount we have (or a specific price range), and the app shows all the options that fit the bill—menus, deals, whatever’s available.

"psa for canada: ubereats improperly charging gst/hst during the tax holiday **edit 2024-12-17:** uber sent out an email blast that included the following text. as of today i still see the taxes at checkout on the app and web... so i guess you're just supposed to hope and pray they handle it on the final receipt?

>we’ve partnered with merchants to ensure the availability of those savings on uber eats, making your orders more affordable. be aware that taxes shown at the checkout screen may not reflect the savings of the gst/hst holiday break — but rest assured, where applicable, taxes will be updated before they are charged and will be displayed on your receipt after delivery is completed.

\--- original post below ---

the national gst/hst break on restaurant food runs from december 14, 2024, to february 15, 2025. on my ubereats account in toronto (android app) and on the website, it seems that if i enter in a pickup order, the total still includes 13% hst even though it should be 0% for the next 2 months. the actual correct rules are that tax should only be applied to fees charged by the delivery service (e.g. service charges) and the food itself should be tax-free.

for what it's worth i've tested several other food apps that all seem to be handing the tax holiday correctly: doordash, skip, fantuan and ritual. so be careful, and if you've already been charged tax improperly on ubereats since saturday, you should complain to support about your order.",2024-12-15 16:09:31,5,11,Reddit,UberEats

"worst ever ubereats experience (terrible customer service, promising fake callbacks, refunded less than the charge, etc) i just had the worst ubereats experience ever. ordered a simple poke bowl 1hr before store close last night, and the food arrived 2hrs late: almost 1hr after the store closed, and delivery took another 30 mins.. not to mention that the app was half-time broken - i could not see where the rider was at all. it was ridiculous that the rider picked up the food 25 mins after the store was closed.

then a 10-15min ride from the store to my home took almost another 30 mins. the rider came with a electric bicylce i guess, opened his insulated bag, and gave me the food bowl directly. next he pulled out the completely broken plastic package (the bottom all wide open) and gave that to me. the bowl was spilled a bit, sauce over the bag as well. all he said was sorry. i understand that this happens, so no big deal.

what pissed me off was my experience with the ""help"" that i could get.

so i contacted customer service in the chat box. the agent could not do nothing but gave me a refund. and sarcastically the refund issued automatically by the system was lower amount than what i was actually charged.

`uber cash`  
`12/14/24 9:48 pm`  
`$23.25`

`uber cash`  
`12/14/24 9:53 pm`  
`-$22.73`

i felt like i was treated badly. so i asked if i could be ""further"" compensated properly. chatted with 5 representatives, all they said was no (since the automatic refund was already issued). i told them that i would like to escalate to the supervisor and chat a bit more. the agent asked me to wait for 2-4 hours and the manager would call me back. fwiw, it's already 11pm local time.

of course this never happened. so this morning i asked again about the callback. obviously the next few representatives all told me the same thing. the manager was going to call me back soon. but this time, i asked to clarify for an estimated time, or immediate call back if possible. one agent said that the supervisor was going to call me back at the end of the conversation, while the others said wait for 24 hours. there was even one guy said there was no guarantee, it's completely dependent on the supervisor's availability...

============================================

honestly at this point i gave up. nowadays there's no way for us to call customer service at all. we can only chat in the ""help"" section. but all of those promises from the agents online saying waiting for a callback in x hours are just mostly not happening.

it's quite a rant, but imho there are many things that they could have done to make it better.",2024-12-15 12:48:52,0,4,Reddit,UberEats

"15+ mile ""hot"" food deliveries i wish uber would stop with these insane trips.

having my food safety license, i know that even the best thermal containers can only hold the safe food temperature range for about 10-15 minutes, before the food falls into what is called the ""danger zone"" for bacterial growth in the food.

i have over 50 screenshots from the past 8 days of orders that were between 12 and 50 miles. yes, **50.** drive time between 30 and 120 minutes. i refused them all. partially due to time, but mostly because the average pay per mile was about 20 cents per mile *including* tip and uber's trip pay.

most restaurants do not have a heating shelf. they usually prep the order, package it, and set it on a room-temperature rack for the drivers to grab and run.

so when a customer complains about their food being cold, it's a combination of factors. starting at the restaurant, continuing if the driver has a thermal bag (most drivers either do not or don't use it if they do), and then based on the drive time...

my point is customers expecting hot food to be hot, especially in winter, will very likely experience disappointment. especially with uber re-routing orders to restaurants much further than the customer asked for.

" delivery drivers being shown incorrect delivery instructions
 i live in an apartment and include my intercom number in the delivery instructions, which i keep saved. i have an alternate set of instructions which includes my girlfriend's intercom number for when she's home and i'm not.



for the past 6 orders, despite having the instructions selected with my intercom number, my girlfriend's intercom number has been dialed while she's been at work (not phone number on the account, the intercom number from the delivery instructions). i've tried uninstalling & reinstalling the app and outright deleting all my saved instruction sets and then making a new one that only includes my intercom, yet hers is still being dialed.



uber support (both over phone and text chat) has been unhelpful and insists everything is working correctly. it's very clear that incorrect instructions are being displayed to drivers. i have also verified that the intercom numbers go to the correct phones. how can i fix this?

"driver ran away with my food and ubereats won’t refund me. just writing this makes me mad, but it’s finals season and it’s about -20c where i am so it’s pretty cold. anyways, i ordered a burger cuz i got hungry from studying and then when it finally arrived, my driver was responding at first but then he couldn’t find me for a good 30 minutes?… that’s when i got worried cuz just use the map? i tried calling him multiple time but he wouldn’t pick up and this is where i got annoyed. i tried directing him to where i was but he would just leave me on opened instead he told me to come to where he was. outside in the cold. mind you he wasn’t where i put in the location, it was a good 30 minute walk. he refused to reply me again and i got hangry. he would just ignore everything i told him and tell me to meet him and i just couldn’t do that. eventually he left with my food after ghosting me and now when i used support uber eats wont refund me “as i am not eligible for a refund” what do i do now 😞.",2024-12-14 21:20:12,1,2,Reddit,UberEats

so my question is what happened to the order? did he take it? did he give it back to the shop? will he get paid? i received a refund without me having to contact customer service as it was done automatically when he canceled but i’m just confused and i hope he didn’t throw the food away as i hate food waste.

i get there, it will not let me mark delivered.  i mark 'customer changed address' in app, everything.  support has to cancel eventually, says they documented that customer received food, and i had to call back later to actually get paid.

"anyone ever seen a tip on a chownow order? i just had one for the first time. i’m fairly certain the customer left a tip. nice lady met me out in front, expensive sushi, wealthy part of town ordering from 5+ miles away.

after order finishes, it just says “upfront fare: $10.45” and nothing about the tip showing up in an hour. the pay breakdown just shows net fare and a promotion/trip premium of $4.49. chownow states that if you leave a tip, it only may get to the drivers. 

what i’m wondering is if that’s what the “trip premium” was. there’s no reason this order should have had a premium. pickup was easy, with prop 22 many drivers would have jumped on this for just the base pay… we never get premiums here.

the reason this is a massive problem, is because if tips are categorized as promotion pay, then they’re counting towards prop 22. which means they’re literally using tips to subsidize our base pay adjustment for all the times they underpay us. the customer could leave a $50 tip and it would literally be the equivalent a no tip order here. we’d just be getting a partial advance on money already due to us.

so to my question: has anyone seen a tip explicitly labeled tip in the pay breakdown of a chownow order?",2024-12-13 23:27:36,3,4,Reddit,UberEats

"opportunities: earn $16.50/active hour (plus tips).... not! lately, in illinois (idk if it's everywhere)... uber has offered the title opportunity during peak hours. sometimes as low as $14. sometimes as high as $20.

""active hour"" is defined as the moment you accept the offer to deliver until the moment you swipe ""delivery complete"". overlapping orders do not double the pay, they simply keep you active. you do not get mileage pay at all during this time.

the fine print: if you decline 2 requests within 60 minutes of each other, you return to no hourly pay and simply tips + 20-30 cents a mile.

the good: if you get multiple solid orders, you can actually make around $10/hour plus tips.

the bad: i just did 4 hours of this and took 15 deliveries. not one of the deliveries was shorter than 5 miles, with one of them being a 13 mile drive. home now, i checked all the tips.... smh... ugh... 1 $4.50 and the rest $1 - $2.

worse: if you accept an order that was stolen/picked up by another driver before you, it counts as one of the 2 possible cancellation hits. if you get 2 stolen/picked up by another driver orders, the hourly pay ends.

thus far, it looks awesome, but irl, it is probably better to not bother signing up for hourly pay.",2024-12-13 17:30:20,1,3,Reddit,UberEats

"dispute and fear of meeting the delivery person good evening,

i am a 28 year old woman living alone in an apartment in a big city.

yesterday i placed an order on ubereat and the delivery guy stole the order by pretending he had stayed downstairs.

he did not contact me and did not follow the instructions (more than precise, really i can't be more precise), he simply took a photo of the front door of the building and marked the order delivered on the app.

i immediately went down to understand while calling him on the phone (10 times) until he finally answered me to tell me ""no no it's over i came, i'm not coming"" whereas when they take the photo, they normally have to drop it off and take a photo of the location, short

i got angry at my incomprehension, because he had just stolen €25 from me, normal and i admit i insulted him on the phone...

in short, after a long conversation with an ubereat robot, i finally have confirmation of the refund and that he did not follow the delivery instructions, and therefore he is at fault.

so i don't know what to do because i'm afraid of running into him again with an ubereat order... can i block a delivery person? (he knows my name and address)

"latest delivery time changed and driver disappears off the map. tried to talk to support but felt like i got essentially got the answer of not our problem so we don’t care. is this common?

placed an order around 7:45 ish with a starting latest arrival time off 8:40. the place i ordered from is a 10 to 15 minute drive from where i was. when the driver was “ one stop from my location” they disappeared off the map for upwards of 10 minutes and the latest delivery time jumped by an hour. along with this, i lost all options to communicate with the driver.  food arrived at 9:15 with the cold food melted and the hot food cold. 

when the hour long jump in latest arrival time occurred i tried reaching out to uber support in the app and was just getting the robot run around. i tried calling the uber eats support phone number but got a message saying they had made improvements to the app and they weren’t accepting calls at the number any more. eventually talked to a “real person” in the app and basically got that because the food got there before the final arrival time they don’t offer refund. i was kicked from the chat (probably user error idk). i started a second chat and got almost the exact same answer. when i tried to ask about not being able to contact or see the driver i was told that i could and they just weren’t answering. when i provided a screen shot that showed no option 
i got a response of
“i understand your frustration over this matter; however, we have already provided you with accurate information about this order. as there are no further actions that can be taken here, we won’t be able to respond to further messages on this issue. i would like to close this conversation now. thank you for contacting chat support. stay safe and healthy.”

so i guess simply put i have two questions.
1. how often do latest arrival times jump by 1hr plus after the order is picked up/ enroute. 
2. why during delivery would the driver disappear off the map and leave no option to contact them.

"oh no, i’m gonna be some customer’s story on here 😂 (made a series of embarrassing mistakes) ok so i’m taking this order into an apartment building that does not have a reception desk, but the customer has selected “leave at building reception.” i decide i should make absolutely sure there’s not another door or something, so i text the guy.

so as i get off the elevator on his floor i’m kinda distracted texting him to confirm (he doesn’t respond) and i leave it at the apartment door. i go back to my car and drive off.

he says “you gave me the wrong food and left it at the wrong apartment.” oh sh!t. he then says “are you missing something?” mind you i’m driving. he repeats that and i’m like “you mean the right food? i have your food if that’s what you mean.”

then he’s like “do you have your key” and i’m thinking this guy is weird af, i guess maybe he’s in the habit of calling the door code a “key”? i’m like no actually i don’t have the code anymore since the order’s closed. he gives it to me.

when i get up there to trade him food, he has my freaking car keys. i drove off without them (i’d left the car running). if i’d given him the right food, i would have ended up stranded god knows where when i finally turned the car off and it refused to start again.

"uber caught stealing from their customers i noticed multiple charges equaling 5 or 10 cents more than the agreed upon price at checkout. they wait until after delivery and then change the receipt to try and hide the theft. when you confront them about it they claim that the second charge is the pre-authorization payment but ignore when you point out the price difference at checkout vs post-delivery. support does not want to address it.

i noticed i wasn't alone and that there are multiple people who have posted about this over the past few months. uber is probably raking in a lot of dollars this way.

if you wanted to dispute you would have to do it for each individual charge which would only net you 5 or 10 cents and they'd just lock you out for fraudulent activity if you went through your bank or cc for chargebacks.

"urgent help needed: uber account issue
 i’m posting here to seek help with a frustrating issue i’m facing with my uber account. i’ve already contacted uber help through their online messaging system, but the response has been extremely slow, and i haven’t been able to resolve the problem.

https://preview.redd.it/rxgsilcvca6e1.png?width=746&format=png&auto=webp&s=d7c400c7af965dd1c0a04ccd32866aa2e34287d7

here’s the situation:

i’m a university student currently on vacation until january, and i’m trying to start a delivery job with uber to earn some income before my next term begins. however, i’ve been stuck for over a week now trying to set up my account.

**what happened:**

1. i used a referral link from a friend to sign up as a new driver in australia.
2. i went to the uber app and clicked on “earning by driving and delivering,” but the page didn’t load properly. i’ve attached screenshots to show what i’m seeing. i’ve refreshed the page many times, but it doesn’t work. my friend doesn’t know what’s wrong either.
3. when i first messaged uber help, they told me that i have an existing account in malaysia (penang). they asked if i’d like to delete it, and i replied “yes” and gave my consent. but since then, i haven’t received any updates or actions on their side.

**my questions:**

* is this issue happening because of my malaysian uber account?
* what do i need to do to fix this and complete the sign-up process as a driver in australia?
* has my malaysian account been processed for deletion, or do i need to do something else to move forward?

this situation is really urgent for me, and it’s been stressful trying to figure it out without any clear guidance. if anyone has been through a similar experience or knows how to resolve this, i would greatly appreciate your advice or support.

"question for drivers re:tips i am really just getting annoyed that all my orders lately, especially on bad weather days, seem to be i guess what you guys call “stacked”. meaning i always see the driver has at least one stop before my house. 

 i tip well(or at least i think i do base on what i see on reddit). i tip at least $8 for delivery of a simple order from a restaurant near my house ( typically less then  1 -2 miles, never more than 2.5) during good weather. if the weather is bad $10 minimum, no less then $5 per mile (the worse the weather the higher i tip). this is for simple pickups from restaurants, not grocery or anything that requires more than picking up food and dropping it off. i also live in a suburb with easy to get to home and little traffic. 

i am guessing this is happening bc stacking my high tip order makes it looks like to the driver they are receiving a decent tip for both orders. it pisses me off, especially during bad weather when everyone should tip, even if you normally don’t, that people are possibly freeloading off my tip. 

here is my question. in the driver’s note if i note my tip would the driver be able to see that and identify that the other order is not tip and decline the second order third order? ",2024-12-11 13:13:15,3,38,Reddit,UberEats

"question about alcohol deliveries..late night...app  should let us know of a walgreens or grocery store order contains alcohol.... question for those of you who have opted in to alcohol deliveries and who deliver at night.  

i deliver from around 7 or 8 pm until about midnight/1 am.  chicago market here, so city (but usually only to 10 pm) and then i go to the burbs (safety reasons as i am a female by myself).  

problem number 1:

uber has no clue about local municipality alcohol laws in regards to the time where alcohol can no longer be sold in that city, township, county, etc.  some burbs here the cut-off is 10 pm, others 11, and even others midnight.  in a 10 mile radius here, you might have 5 different towns, each with different liquor laws.  there has to be data out there (i found websites with each municipality liquor sale laws and hours....why can't uber? 

can't tell you how many times i've been sent someplace to pick up alcohol only to find out it is after hours in that particular city.

problem 2:

late night walgreens,  cvs or grocery store orders.  we don't know what the order includes, only how many items, until we accept.  problem arises when you accept let's say a walgreens order at 12:45 am and it contains alcohol.  bam, you have to cancel and that affects your cancelation rating.  

uber should flag the order as contining alcohol.  i say this for 2 reasons.

1.  if it is super late, there is a very good chance alcohol can no longer be sold.  therefore the driver can pass on that request.

2.  even in earlier evening hours, let's say close to 10 pm, if i'm not in the safest neighborhood (try to avoid those areas at night, but sometimes you just get sucked in or dont realize how bad that area actually is until you get there), i really don't feel safe delivering booze there.   so again, if i knew a grocery store order contained alcohol, i could easily pass.  

would love to hear your thoughts and any suggestions.  it doesn't seem that hard for uber to find a data source in relation to alcohol laws and through an api or something feed that data into their system.  it would be a better environment for the drivers and the customers alike.

as for friendliness. i’m always polite, thanking the customer and saying either “have a goodnight or good morning”.  most my orders are leave at door. but when i see the customer i’m always polite. 
funny thing my rating was low from when i first started i mean the first 10 orders i did already showed low ratings still even as a newbie i didn’t do anything wrong. 
i did just recently read that if you take low orders most those customers always give low rating. i didn’t know at the time and took every order. not sure if that’s why. 
i always communicate when i don’t have enough info for address especially for apartments.
i always let them know when i’m still waiting for orders or waiting in a long line. 
i’ve only canceled an order once cuz the restaurant didn’t have the order. and other cancelations was by support cuz restaurant was closed but my cancellations is low. but i can’t do anything about my ratings i’ve done everything correctly but apparently doing things right isn’t helping.

"driver caught on camera stealing our food so, we got surveillance footage of our driver taking a photo of the food outside our apartment building, and then putting it back in his bag and leaving. 

ubereats at first refused to refund, saying ""you assume responsibility once the food is delivered"". so i guess taking the food out, taking a photo of it and putting it back in your bag counts as delivered. 

they only made an ""exception"" after we told them we had surveillance footage and were reporting them for theft. not sure if i can link to the footage here? it doesn't show his face. 

i feel like we need to make some kind of class action against uber's policy of ""refusing refunds"". we wouldn't have got our money back if there didn't happen to be a camera in our lobby. it seems like they're trying to make customers bear the cost of widespread problems.

look at it this way. uber depends on subservient contractors.

the best way to effectively force change right now is to organize a nationwide black out day. if all delivery people would organize a 1 day black out, the company would sustain a huge black eye, 3 days would take them to their knees, so to speak. maybe ""we"", the drivers should organize a 1 day ue black out to send a message. it may take a few black eyes to get the point across... but it will be rapid.

this is what is disgusting about uber eats taking on the american tipping culture system where it forces customers to tip and forces the delivery drivers to depend on the customers. 

if uber eats can pay people a “liveable” wage in australia why can’t they do the same for people in america. it just shows that uber eats as a company is stealing your money. 

tipping should not be compulsory it should be a bonus for great service. i receive tips when i work if i deliver food timely and use a hot bag. when i get a tip i just am happy because i feel like i’ve done a good job but i am not dependant on that tip. 

there needs to be a huge change in america. a demand for a right to a fair wage for uber deliveries and demand uber pay you instead of stealing your money. too many horror stories of workers harassing customers for tips and customers baiting drivers on here when the system has a chance to be far more functional.

ubereats its trash! driver vs customer so after the experience i have had with ubereats as a customer and driver i can say this company should be shut down. uber rips of their drivers and then drivers don't provide services and then customers get angry and blames driver for ubers unethical business practices. ubereats is most unethical place there is even as a customer the people there are beyond idiots. as a driver ubereats is run by morons that couldn't pass 1st grade. so for you customers that want to blame the driver for crap services maybe look at company that rips of the service provider. look at this way would you customers provide a service for free or not the agreed amount.,2024-12-09 16:20:22,19,25,Reddit,UberEats

"feeling scammed i ordered something last night which i thought was a really good deal, i had added buy one get one free hotdogs to my cart (not bogo promo) and in my cart i added a 15% off promo. my total was about $17. something.

i woke up and checked my bank account to see a charge of $39. something.

after speaking to support i learned that multiple promotions could not be combined. i feel scammed because the app allowed me to do so and convinced me i was getting a really good deal.

i spoke to a few agents hoping for help but nope, i'm thinking of speaking with my bank, i don't see how indirect consent without a notification is enough to justify adjusting a charge or why i the customer should pay for the faults in the uber app.

"my first tip-baiter pretty bummed last night. had a terrible situation made worse by the customer who removed my tip after telling me she'd increase my tip for waiting at a restaurant (which i didn't ask for)

i got to taco bell and was told they were cleaning between shifts and wouldn't have my order for 20 minutes. normally i'd bail but i'm trying to lower my cancellation rate. i texted the customer to let her know there was a delay but that i'd wait no probalo. she said 'awesome, ill add to your tip.'

then got another decent order at same restaurant. after 25 minutes, the taco bell employee said they were still cleaning and it would be another 20 minutes. jeebus. i was already pot-committed and it was my last order at the end of a 15 hour shift so whatevs.

i texted both customers to let them know the delay. neither responded. after another 25 minutes (again, sunk costs prevented me from leaving) i got the orders. one was cold. i dropped both at their locations and went home.

honestly, i did the best i can do as a driver. i communicated every step of the way. no other driver would have been able to do it faster than what was done. instead of an increased tip, one of the tips was deleted. not sure which since uber eats bunched it into a single order.  but i'm guessing it was the one that offered the extra tip. in my experience,, every person that has said that to me has been full of sh*t.

from acceptance to completion it was a total time of 1:50. instead of $25 + extra tip (which is garbage hourly already), i made $10 for nearly 2 hours.

i work 15 hours daily, 7 days a week, so its really a drop in the bucket. but its a little depressing.

on the flip side, i had a handful of deliveries this run that threw in an extra $10 each on already well-paid orders, so life is alright.

i really desperately need to know what the thought process is of drivers like this - ""everyone be okay with the inevitably of drivers stealing your food, or everyone pick up your own food and put me out of a job""?

"cancelled order paid for with a voucher but then charged a fee? i ordered on dec 4th. i had a $75 voucher from work. i used the voucher to pay for the food. i received an email at 5:36p that the voucher was applied to my account. the total was $84.70 including a $10.78 tip so my credit card was charged $9.70 at 5:37p for the remaining balance.

unfortunately there was mistake on the address - i think the app glitched and it picked a random address even though all my delivery instructions and phone number associated with my home address were on the order. i called both the driver and customer service right away they said it would be no problem to change the mistake and have the food delivered.

then i sat waiting for my food, didn't get it, and checked the app around 6:30p for an update and they had cancelled the order ""because the restaurant started making the food"" even though i mever got the food. i never got a call, only an email. instead of charging the cancellation fee against the voucher they refunded the initial $9.70 then charged $73.92 from my credit card at 6:30p. 

also the order receipt in the app has been changed and it no longer shows i paid with a voucher. it just says i used my credit card for $73.92.

i do still have a voucher credit in my account which i just found yesterday when ordering a ride somewhere and is what prompted this whole investigation of my credit statement a few weeks earlier than i usually do it.

i have called customer service twice and they keep telling me i never used the voucher and there is no record of a voucher for this order. i was told it's been more than 48 hours so they can't do any refunds. i asked them if i never used the voucher then why at 5:30p was i charged $9.70 and not the full $84.70? i asked them to explain the accounting. they have no explanation and a ""specialist"" is going to follow up with me. asking to speak to a supervisor got no where.

has this happened to anyone else? i think this is extremely shady that they changed my receipt and now are feigning ignorance and it is very disturbing they can't see on their end why there is a $9.70 charge at 5:30, then the other charges at 6:30. they also cannot direct me toward the cancellation policy that says vouchers can't be used for the ""cancellation fee"".

i am considering filing a charge back with my credit card but as there is still a voucher iny account i don't know how far i'll get with that. also planning to stick with door dash and lyft after this whole thing. 

this whole thing is so stupid! mostly posting to commiserate with anyone else that has problems.

edit: in case anyone wants an update if you had a similar experience, i just kept calling and they would refer me to a ""specialist"" eventually one of the ""specialists"" that they direct you to via their outdated message center refunded me. just waiting for the refund to hit my card them i'm disconnecting from uber entirely.

i ordered from the café near me (called second cup). i had this buy one get one free promotion that essentially would cost me less if i ordered rather than walking in person. i usually walk as it's about a 6 minute walk but i thought: ""eh, costs me less to uber it and get the two drinks""

the drive being very very short, i tipped $2 only because the courier was hardly driving a mile anyways! when the guy handed my order to me, he said ""try tipping better next time. bye."" and walked away.
was i wrong for this? i don't really think that i am, but i do feel kind of bad regardless. i'm open to any opinion incase i am possibly ignorant to something crucial that *would* make me wrong here. thanks!

 it is clear also they promote illicit trade as they allow uber eats delivery accounts to be rented by people who have no right to work and maybe no right to be in the country. apparently this practice e is legal. if i don't hear back and get a refund, i will be contacting my bank to request a refund for fraud. i rang the police who said it is not a police matter. i will also be taking this further to my local mp if necessary as i think this practice should be illegal. i will never in my life use uber eats or deliveroo again. i have been scammed!

"answers: why drivers go the wrong direction/sit for too long... when you order, once a driver is assigned, if you see them on the map either going the wrong direction or just sitting in one place for an excessive amount of time... here's usually why.

there are other reasons, but i hope this pre-emptively answers some of your questions...

1. the driver is multi-apping with doordash, instacart, grubhub, etc. they are taking multiple delivery orders on a single or multiple devices. this means even if they pick up your order, they may go the complete opposite direction you would expect.
2. if moving the wrong way, the driver is likely avoiding trains/school zones/construction. or they're stealing your purchase. give them a solid 5-10 mins or so to turn around. if they don't, contact them in-app or contact uber customer support.
3. if not moving at all for over 5 mins, the driver is either on the phone with uber tech support for some issue (which takes 20-30 mins sometimes) or they are waiting on a train or construction traffic. if they're at the restaurant/pickup location for over 10 mins, they're either dealing with tech support or waiting on multiple orders and the restaurant is taking too long to assemble and pack the other order. if you ordered pizza, sometimes it may take up to 20-30 mins to pick up.
4. flat tire, crash, vehicle issue. on friday, i was mid-delivery when i got a flat tire. i still delivered (on the flat) because the customer was less than a mile from my location when i got the flat. i inflated my tire at the customer's home and drove to the maintenance shop. (my vehicle does not come with a spare tire.) sometimes things happen that are out of our control.
5. they are on t-mobile (or any mobile network provider that uses t-mobile gps). t-mobile is notorious for having a totally inconsistent and unreliable gps system. looking at my mileage tracker route lines at the end of a shift, it shows my vehicle standing in one place for over 20 mins, then speeding up and crossing lakes, rivers, and places there are no roads at over 100 mph. that is due to the t-mobile gps satellites disconnecting, losing signal, and being hit by solar flares. i switched to a different provider and the issue is gone. but t-mobile drivers may experience complete disconnection from the gps satellites for up to 1 hour at a time and be forced to navigate blindly, if they don't know your neighborhood.",2024-12-08 05:51:34,2,7,Reddit,UberEats

the first order comes out and i verify it and as soon as i click verify there’s a third order? i never saw three orders to verify, i even scrolled up and down and it was just the two for jack and jane. all of the sudden there’s one for melissa. they bring me my second order and i ask about melissa’s and they tell me it will be a few minutes, i just cancel hers and start to deliver. 

but now, i don’t see the one towards my house on the stops. sure enough the second order i delivered was never on either of the original orders i had accepted and it sure as hell wasn’t 8 miles away towards my house. i go look at my earnings expecting to see $6.40 and that the second order i had accepted was actually a stack but nope, it was $14.80. 

so either a: the original order was actually a stack and was just a glitch and only showed one stop, 

or b: the second order i accepted was a stack and there was $8 of hidden tip? 

i’m genuinely so confused anyone else have this happen to them? the $16 order i accepted was literally a straight line from the restaurant 8 miles out towards my place, there was no second stop anywhere. same with the add on, it was just a single extra drop off.

"are customers gaming the grocery shopping option? **edit to add **  

gaming doesn't mean ""receiving free items""....gaming means, i know a driver will be less likely to accept a 30 item grocery order with little to no tip, so i will just initially add 5 items, then, once the order is accepted, i (said from customer pov) will simply add the remaining 25 items...)


hi,still relatively new to delivering.  i like to deliver on the weekends when my 6 year old is visiting her father.  gets me out of the house, and honestly,  i've discovered several new restaurants my friends and i will be visiting.  probably never would have even heard of some of these places had i not accepted a delivery request from these locations.  

anyways, my question is....do you find that on shopping orders (i live in chicago) from a grocery store like jewel (one of our chains) or similar, customers like to game the system.  let me explain... 

a grocery order comes in.  i actually don't mind some of these as they usually pay better (with estimated tip) than the $2.82 mcdonalds pickup that is a 6 mile trip (sure, 6 miles doesn't sound far, but in chicago traffic, even light traffic, 6 miles takes a long time).  and no...i don't accept those orders....$1 per mile minimum.   learned that quick!!!!

lately, i've been finding, i accept a grocery order and it says there are a few items.  i accept and head to the grocery store.  then, in between accepting and starting, the customer adds on many additional items.  

case in point, my 1st and last delivery of friday evening (tonight as of writing this).  jewel order for 5 items, 5.5 miles total.  decent expected pay, not great, but decent for 5 items and under 8 miles.  i hit accept.  then, the customer starts adding items to the list.  no big deal.  i've added an item or two to my own deliveries that i forgot about. but this was not an item or two...it was 23 more items. i was there...had started shopping,so i picked everything up.  

and, you probably already guessed it.  the customer did not tip more.  in fact, they actually canceled their tip.  i found every item, with only one substitution.  

i'm still relatively new.  is this a thing?  i've noticed this several times already.  granted, not to this extent, but it seems like customers know to add a few initial items, add a small tip to make it somewhat worth the drivers time to go, do the shopping, and deliver.  but then, a 3, 4 or 5 item stop turns into a 10, 15 or 20 item stop.  it triples our time at the store, delays any other ongoing order we may have, etc. if this happened once or twice, i wouldn't be asking,but many times....is it just me or is this a thing most customers do?  should i never accept a grocery order?",2024-12-06 23:26:15,1,12,Reddit,UberEats

except that refunded order still counted as a usage of the code. i wanted to see if they'd be willing to generate a new single-use code to make up for the used one. 

but judging by the fact that they literally stopped taking calls to their only support number, seems like they don't give a flying hell about customers. the only way to 'get help' is about a specific order, and even then it's all very specific stuff.

"cancellation rate rules - hurting good drivers cancellation rate...

if - for any reason whatsoever - a driver is incapable of picking up or delivering an accepted offer, it is counted against that driver as a %.

if the driver exceeds 10% cancellation rate, they are downgraded in priority to receive good offers.

if the driver exceeds 15% cancellation rate, they stop receiving orders that pay tip.

once the driver reaches 20% cancellation rate, they are deactivated.

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------

if a driver arrives at the pickup location only to find the uber app has already assigned the order to a different driver, who already picked it up, it is a cancellation mark against the second, third, etc drivers.

if a driver arrives at the pickup location and cannot find the item or the restaurant/store is closed, it counts as a cancellation mark against them.

if a driver is shopping for groceries with shop & deliver but unable to find any of the items (store never sold the items or store is sold out of everything on the shopping list), it counts as a cancellation mark against them.

if the driver arrives to pick up items that will not fit inside their car or exceed safe weight limits for transport, it counts as a cancellation mark against the driver.

if the driver accepts a multiple-pickup order and cannot pick up any of the multiple orders, it counts as multiple cancellation marks against them.

if the customer cancels an order themselves and the driver has accepted that offer already, it counts against the driver as a cancellation mark.

if the restaurant or retailer cancels the order due to lack of stock, while the driver has already accepted or even arrived to pick it up, it counts against the driver as a cancellation mark.

**in general, the honest, truly hard-working drivers are all being penalized by uber at no fault of their own. cancellation percentage rules should be reviewed very closely.**

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

i went from 1% cancellation rate to 10% in less than 48 hours because multiple of the above events occurred.

in 3 of the situations, it was hot food that was stolen by the previous driver.

in 3 of the situations, it was grocery pick up at jewel-osco and walmart where the customer cancelled the order themselves.

in 2 of the situations i arrived shortly after or shortly before another ue driver. we both went to claim the same exact order. we compared screens and saw we had the same order. whoever was fastest at swiping ""pickup complete"" got the delivery and the other got a cancellation mark.",2024-12-06 05:34:33,39,61,Reddit,UberEats

"lesson i learned ordering from target on ubereats for the first time 1. screenshot your order as soon as you make it. make sure you have all items listed, the prices, the codes used, the total price. you will not be getting any kind of email confirmation for the order you actually made and have no protection if it gets screwed up. the only email you'll get is when the order has been fulfilled and finalized and you have been charged whatever they changed it to later. driver will substitute items that cost more and promo codes used will magically disappear with the change so you are paying full price. i know i used the grocery 50% code and got $40 off because that's the whole reason i made my order. it also took me forever to put together the order. then the incompetent bottom dwelling uber cs agent will say prove it with a picture and screenshot of the promo, even though it disappears after it's been used, and also send over a picture of the item you are trying to buy even though you can't take a picture of an item you didn't receive. there is no clear email indicating the promo i used either.
2. uber cs is generally incompetent, do not listen at all, do not resolve issues, and charge for the cancellation once the order has been accepted by someone, regardless of the fact that the order was messed up due to the item not being in stock to begin with or driver mistake or store mistake, etc. they make it so you can't rate them if they disconnect without helping, all be design. there's no way to report a bad agent so they are free to be complete asshats, unless someone in here knows a way.
3. don't use ubereats for any grocery or convenience store items again unless prepared for it to go sideways and have to put up a fight. again screenshot everything and codes used so you have evidence. i didn't realize i had to do this when i made the order because, oh, you know, i trust a company to not be shady like not send you a confirmation of what you ordered, and knowing so, try to make you come up with proof after the entire order got changed. they are way too big to not have better systems in place.",2024-12-05 19:48:42,2,5,Reddit,UberEats

i then waited another 10ish minutes and absolutely nothing changed or happened. i figured that he had abandoned the order wherever it was left and requested help from uber again which then gave me a refund. then i noticed i could click into the picture the dasher had taken and saw that now seeing more of it that he had left it at a random apartment on a floor very far away from mine.

i felt pretty stupid, but i was also pretty annoyed with this as i was literally in a meeting at this point and was going to be in back-to-back ones for at least a few hours. i actually moved my meeting to my phone and took the stairs down to that apartment and grabbed my food.

i then briefly tried to tell uber that i actually did get my food, but because of the very limited ways in which you can contact them, i wasn’t able to. there is no phone number to call or even an email to respond to as far as i can tell and the app has no place to tell it “actually i did get my food in the end”. then after another 5 minutes the driver who i had assumed was long gone showed up knocking at my door.

i felt bad as i realized that he was still trying to bring me my food so i went to the door and tried to give him the $5 tip he would’ve gotten from the order. he asked me what happened and i told him he left the food at the wrong door and that i had to get it myself and that i had gotten a refund from uber. he apologized and said it was his bad and then he went to leave. i felt really bad that this worked out that way especially since most drivers give so little effort or care into getting you your food. i tried to give him the tip again which he again refused and again he apologized and left.

i don’t really think that i did anything wrong at any point in this process with the information that i had and through all of it i was pretty distracted with my job, but aita? this order took too long and unnecessarily inconvenienced me, which admittedly defeated the entire purpose of why i places the order to begin with, but also i feel like i took pay away from someone who was trying his best and made an honest mistake that i was ultimately able to correct. what do yal think?",2024-12-05 09:21:57,5,7,Reddit,UberEats
"list of companies to avoid offers for pickup while i am certain all these companies have great products and services, with dedicated employees...

for various reasons, any time i see an offer to pick up food, groceries, merchandise, or packages from them, i have learned to avoid them like the plague...

some of you may feel completely differently, having had nothing but the best experiences with them. i am specifically speaking of what i have gone through over the past 2 years in the chicago region...

companies to avoid:

**walmart**

\- why? there's a minimum 25%-50% chance your pickup is already in someone else's vehicle on the way to the customer when you arrive. when you check in at a pickup parking space, you will wait a minimum of 10-20 min before you get your pickup order... or someone will come to your car after that amount of time to let you know your order is gone already. then there are the 60"" flatscreen tvs, boxed bicycles, and other items you'd have to rip out your back seat row to fit into the car.

**lowes/menards hardware**

\- why? a typical pickup will be a 200-300lb window air conditioner, 200-300lb worth of lumber, or something that will never fit inside a regular car. the orders are never labeled as heavy items or oversize items. then there are literal barrels of paint... need i say more?

**sharky's fish & shrimp (and chicken)**

\- why? i've been to 3 of these. they are extremely rageful at all delivery drivers. they yell, shout, and threaten us if we do not turn our phone to face them, tap verify order, then swipe pickup complete. only after that will they bag the order and give it to us. i've even had one instance where the person screaming took out their cell phone and called 9-1-1 on a customer who just wanted a little more hot sauce.

**popeyes**

\- why? not once have they been 100% accurate on a customer's order. having ordered delivery from them a few times, and having spoken with customers via text when picking up, i know that it's normal for them to miss an item or three on the customer's paid receipt. atop this, they do not start prepping anything until the driver arrives, having us wait until the entire line of drive-thru and counter customers have their orders before assembling the uber order for us. average wait time on arrival to pick up: 12-20 min.

**petsmart/petco**

\- why? with petsmart and petco, uber will send 1 driver for each pickup order. then they will send 1-2 more drivers for those exact same orders, sometimes with one driver who is supposed to pick up everything for every customer (multi-order)... if you are not the first to arrive, you have to cancel the pickup. i went from 1% cancelation rate to 6% in 30 seconds. if you get more than 3 of these, you're sunk.

**party city**

\- why? *balloons!* fully inflated and stuffed in giant bags that will fill every nook and cranny of your vehicle. driving with only a 70 degree view from the closest edge of your rearview mirror to the peripheral of your driver's side window is dangerous. i did it once for over 12 miles. never again.

**lou malnatis / angelo's pizza / nancy's pizzeria / gino's east / paisano's pizza**

 \- why? 3 words: chicago deep dish. *not from chicago? let me explain...* a chicago deep dish pizza has freshly made dough, layers of cheese, toppings, then freshly crushed tomatoes. then they slow-bake the pizza for 35-45 mins. the pie must rest for 5-10 mins after removing from the oven. then and only then do they box it and possibly cut it. uber eats does not time the offer for drivers to arrive when the pizza is cooked and ready. instead, drivers will be expected to wait 1 hour for the pizza to bake and rest. that's 1 hour of other potential orders you could have taken instead.

... my fellow uber drivers, what other companies have you flagged as no go?",2024-12-05 08:53:51,1,10,Reddit,UberEats
"question is there anything i can do to filter out drivers on bikes when i purchase priority delivery? it’s just frustrating when im in a huge rush so i pay extra for my food to arrive an estimated 10 minutes earlier than the regular time, and then the driver is on a bike which makes the food arrive 10-20 minutes later than the original time, and it still takes the extra money that i paid for the priority. i have nothing against drivers on bikes and i know that not everybody has access to a car that they can use for uber eats, its just that when i buy priority it’s because i need the food to arrive as fast as possible so i pay extra, and then the food arrives 10-20 minutes later than the estimated time and the app still takes the extra money that i paid

"uber support ignoring my messages? i had a $35 order delivered to the wrong building a few days ago. in the delivery picture it shows a white door and the same unit number but my door is black. from the moment it was delivered i tried contacting the delivery driver 10 times, both directly and through uber and he just didn't answer. 

i have been attempting to contact uber support with clear proof (i.e. showing the doors are clearly different, call logs for the driver) and they concluded i still couldn't get a refund for it. i tried asking for additional context like the exact reason why they just won't refund me and i have been ignored for the last two days. 

i tried the help/support again and now it's saying it's too late to report the order after 48 hours when i had been contacting them constantly from minute one!

uber's navigation sucks in general and it always tells the driver to go to the next building over and i always need to clarify, but even then my neighbours suck and i've had food snatched from my door before i could even get to it. i always provide proof whenever i can. wtf.

"uber support sucks edit: i’m just venting. this is just really frustrating lol. i read some of the other posts and realised that this seems to be a common issue. didn’t know that before today. wish they’d do better smh

edit 2: got an email from uber support this morning. i’ll be getting a refund. pleasantly surprised since i thought it was a lost cause. it’s really frustrating to jump through so many hoops but oh well. they still suck tho lol 

i make relatively large orders from time to time. without fail, every other order is either missing something (restaurant’s fault) or my order is delivered to the wrong address. e.g. i live on 13 maple close and my food would be delivered to 13 mulberry walk, which is the street behind me. both are fake addresses but it reflects the similarity in street differences.

i let it slide most times but since last month, i’ve had issues with every single order i’ve received so i did what i thought was the smart thing and reached out to uber support. i usually have to fight tooth and nail to even speak to a real agent and they hardly ever want to give me a refund. 

now, i understand that people do that “didn’t receive food/got wrong items” scam often but how is there no way for those of us who are legitimately needing help/refunds to actually prove ourselves???

my current issue now is that after, once again, missing items and simultaneously receiving the wrong thing, i’m now being told that i’ve received too many refunds/credits so boo hoo… basically. i can’t get in contact with a real agent (pics in comments) and this is honestly very frustrating.

by “too many” they mean twice when my order was sent to the wrong house and i had to reach out to support because the driver ignored my messages and calls. and once when i had some missing items from a split delivery.

"offers: $3 or less, 5-10 miles... behind you! perhaps one of the biggest causes of a falling ar (acceptance rate) are all the dozens of offers (trip radar + exclusive) for drivers to make a u-turn, then proceed 5-10 miles for a pittance. 

those of us who live near major cities and prefer to remain outside of the central downtown traffic know all about this.

i live within 15 mi of chicago. between the hours of 7am and 7pm, if you are anywhere east of cicero ave, it's wall to wall construction trucks, semi trailers, delivery vans, and idiots who neither recognize nor acknowledge red lights, stop signs, school zones, nor speed limits.

there are many decent, respectful drivers, yes. but 75% of the vehicles are driving 40 in a 25, 50 in a 30, and lane switching nonstop, all the while riding the bumper of the car in front of them (within 12 inches).

so whenever i end up taking a great paying offer toward the city, it's typically followed by a half dozen offers for $1.50-$3 going at least 5-10 miles. i know some people say there's a $2 minimum, but i've received countless $1.43, $1.25, $1.72 offers inside the chicago city limits.

until uber listens to drivers... until a minimum payout of $1 per mile is established by default and the $2 minimum is respected and enforced, no one in their right mind will ever take those garbage offers.

for the third time in two months, i just showed up at my local wendy’s to pick up an order that i was supposed to make $37 off of. they are telling me i am the third driver who showed up. i assume the first driver took the order for themselves, and then canceled the delivery.

i am getting so tired of this crap. a few weeks ago i waited in the lobby at wendy’s for 33 minutes before they told me they didn’t have it. every time i contact uber support they tell me i am not eligible for any payment. 

i’ve been uber eats for three years and we definitely used to get at least a few dollars for the effort, but these days they just tell us, “sorry you get nothing and we will cancel it.” even more aggravating when you’ve driven, maybe 10 or 15 miles to pick some thing up and have them waited another 20+ minutes before learning  you’re  not getting the order. getting paid nothing.

on this pick up attempt the manager at wendy's was trying to tell me the last driver contacted uber support and canceled the order. but i reached out to the customer and they are assuring me. the order was never canceled and refunded. when i then went back inside and told manager this way, then tried to tell me the order never even came up on their system.

this is the same wendy's a few months ago. i showed up one night to pick up 25 hamburgers and they tried to tell me the order never came through but they were locking up doors early and understaffed so i think they just didn't want to make 25 burgers burgers.

last week i went to pick up a batch of walmart orders. was waiting outside after checking in for 50 minutes. walmart canceled the whole batch one by one as i was sitting there. i was supposed to make $90 when i contacted uber support just a generic apology and telling me that i'm not eligible for any pay after sitting there close to an hour after arriving and checking in.

"60% down to 23% in 5 hours  this morning, as usual, i got up around 3:00 a.m. to go out for my 4:00 a.m. to noon delivery schedule. i typically do breakfasts.

as of 4:00 a.m. this morning, my acceptance rate was 60%. my cancellation rate was 1%. 

over the past 5 hours, i have had no cancellations. not one. however, my cancellation rate is now 3%. 

likewise, i have turned down every single order that did not pay for mileage as well as every single order that was below $5. the vast majority of those orders were a minimum 10 mile drive. 

so i went from that 60% to 23% today on accepting orders.

and i just received a warning that my acceptance rate is below the average in my area. no s*** sherlock.


uber doesn't really care how little, if any, the customer tips. nor do they care how little, or how much a driver makes per mile or per hour. they collect billions of dollars in fees from customers for profit. they do not pass on even a single percentage point of that profit to the drivers as pay. so when they track our acceptance rates and cancellation rates and warn us about falling below average, all while so many customers refuse to tip... when they offer us deliveries that are 10 plus miles for no money, they don't really care.

"a driver stole my food from the restaurant, the restaurant refuses to remake the food and says ""call uber support"" last night was my wife's birthday.  we don't use uber eats very often, but they have some nicer restaurants than doordash in our area, so we ordered from one of them.

i noticed that a driver was assigned to it and that he was driving an acura.  (it stood out in my mind because that's not something you see every day.)

i go on about my business and a woman calls (not the driver who was originally assigned) and asks if i have received my food.  she says that the restaurant is saying that someone has already picked up.  i tell her no, i do not have it.  she says okay, she will let them know.

10 minutes later, someone else calls and tells me the same thing.  he hands his phone to the restaurant manager who tells me that they will not re-make the food until uber eats support calls them and agrees to pay them to make it again and that i have to call uber eats support.

i wasn't thrilled with this - this was their fault for handing off food to the first driver without making them verify in the app that they had picked it up.  it's not up to me to fix their mess.

so anyway, i called uber eats support, but about that time, it says that the order is canceled because the third driver indicated in the app that the restaurant could not fulfill the order.  (i assume that this gets them half pay like it would for doordash?)  

by this point, it was over an hour later, and we wound up just ordering somewhere closer by from doordash - pretty disgusted with the whole experience.",2024-12-03 10:27:24,30,142,Reddit,UberEats
"uber eats choosing stores/restaurants? i have noticed lately that uber eats will send me to a store 10 miles away even though i'm sitting right next to one. then they will send me back to where i originally was. for example, i'm right next to walgreens but they send me to a walgreens 10 mi away and then the customer's house will be closer to the original walgreens. i have noticed this with restaurant pickups too. they sent me two exits away to pick up mcdonald's and bring it back, when there is a mcdonald's closer to the customer's house.  this seems extremely inefficient to me.
they also keep trying to send me stacked orders when i have a customer's order of milk or ice cream in my car, waiting to be delivered. i always decline.
i'm not sure if it's the app algorithm or if the customer is choosing the pickup store, it just seems extremely inefficient. i guess i just wanted to complain lol.",2024-12-03 09:46:42,5,16,Reddit,UberEats

but i had a bunch of texts from uber & there was a number - i figured i could text but it appears to be a routing kind of number as it auto-replied: ""sorry, we are not sure who you are trying to message. if you are trying to contact someone on an uber trip, please ensure that you are sending this message from the phone number associated with your uber account.""

"chinese takeout scammers? so i wanted to bring this up, because tonight something occurred to me for the second time and it really bothered me. a couple months ago while working for doordash in bergen county, nj (yes this is an ubereats sub and it will get there, don't worry), i get an order for a chinese takeout spot, i get there and show the screen with the order and am told that i need to pay with the red card... dd would tell the dasher that the order requires a red card prior to acceptance... being the first time i encountered this situation, i called the customer and explained the situation and told her i would also be calling support to figure out how to handle it. she even sent me a screenshot of the order and her charge on her statement. long story short, the woman at the takeout spot made the case that every doordash driver pays with the red card, yet i explained dd would have told me, and that they said they'd be calling them (which they did, and just were met with arrogant arguments)... eventually the customer canceled.

tonight; slightly the same situation with ubereats. a different chinese takeout spot (same county, different town), this time the woman tells me that ubereats must pay while doordash doesn't. i laughed in her face, took her entire jar of dum-dums, flipped the bird and canceled the order.

"credit promised then revoked this happened to me and i am beyond confused

i had an uber order delivered next door and the app didn’t notify me.

it sat there for 20-30 minutes (-15) by the time i found it. i was no longer able to eat it, it was mostly egg based items and frozen. 

i spoke to an agent and he reluctantly elevated my case to give me a 10 dollar credit (order was 50)

a few days went by and the credit never came so i followed up 

the new agent called me a liar and said they don’t give refunds for cold food and that i mislead the agent.

he then asked for a photo of the food as proof….i was never asked for a photo the first time so i didn’t take one.

i am not posting to discuss the validity of my claim although delivering to the wrong house isn’t really my fault….rather the process of offering a credit and then just not giving it?

i won’t use the app any more as i think we as the consumer has lost sight of using our dollar to vote. it’s a food delivery app that takes no responsibility for the service.

"650 uber eats orders in i mostly see people complaining about one thing or another with uber eats so a recent order has given me inspiration to make a post.


i very rarely tip, i'm australian and our system is just better for both parties, but i tipped 30 percent because i was so impressed. i ordered a meal from a vietnamese place and it took 18 minutes to arrive the drive is at least 15 minutes and he put it in front of my door and not one of my neighbors, an absolute master class.


i'd say out 650 orders i've had issues with about 100, 70 or so would be with delivering to the wrong address, 5-10 with the driver and 15-20 with the store, maybe 3 or 4 orders were stolen out of this, including one where my neighbor got chewed out by the delivery lady for taking food that wasn't his and tried to return half a pizza to us while still eating a slice and trying to explain he thought he ordered a pizza.


drivers getting the wrong address has gone down pretty drastically since i've been able to upload pictures of the front of my house, however they still deliver it to the wrong house occasionally however ive made sure to call them of late and have them bring it to me as i know all my neighbors front doors by now and i used to get it myself however if the driver doesn't know they're getting it wrong they won't learn so having to drive a few minutes back to rectify their mistake should theoretically make them pay more attention on drop off, i even spent 150 bucks on house numbers that light up at night.

"been scammed on uber eats all the time (rant) title says it all. 80 percent of the time my order is wrong, missing items and in some cases even damaged. i have ordered ubereats too many times to count. i've been working 13 hour shifts monday to friday so i just find it easy to order food. i've come to the realization though that this app is garbage. i don't know where the miscommunication and errors are occurring. i could go to the official website of the pizza place and order food with no errors. then you go onto ubereats and my order will have missing drinks, wrong toppings and in some cases my pizza has moved around so much that it's a complete mess with the pizza and toppings splattered and crushed everywhere. its not just pizza though that gets messed up it's anything i order. buy 1 get 1 free then i only get 1. i order 10 nuggets and i get 8. i order a fountain drink but it tastes like garbage. i order a burger and they put stuff on it i dont like and didn't select to be on there. i order tacos and they out stuff on them i didn't ask for. i order popeyes and i'm missing chicken. it doesn't matter what i order it's getting messed up 80 percent of the time. i think the mistake they make that makes me the most angry even though i'm not even losing that much money is when they deliver a meal and then the drinks are not there. if i order a 45 dollar meal and ask for 3 root beer cans and you deliver the meal but not the cans it's just like why.. its like ok a mistake was made ill try and see if i can get a partial refund for the missing sodas but then my refund gets denied. 

i don't know what is going on with this app but it's a scam. i wouldn't recommend it to anyone. yesterday was the final straw for me when i ordered the buy 1 get 1 free deal and only 1 arrived and the order was wrong. i've been given a refund 2 times out of 30 wrong orders and 1 of the refunds was just a 4 dollars partial refund from a 40 dollar order and 7.50 tip.

i'm really tired of being scammed. if i pay for something and it doesn't show up with the rest of my order then that's a scam. i'm paying for something and not getting it.",2024-12-01 07:19:29,18,118,Reddit,UberEats

personally, talking to support just to be told ill be compensated 2 dollars for half an hour worth of time due to ubers mistake was the breaking point for me and was the reason i dont even order food there anymore.

i called the driver who ignored my first call, but picked up on my second attempt, claimed that he was “far away” already even tho i’d only gotten notification 4 minutes prior. i had spent those few minutes snooping around my neighbors’ trying to find it before calling. 

the driver was trying to be helpful on the phone, but ultimately did nothing but send me down the driveways of my neighbors to their back doors looking for it. he claimed he turned around and was coming back to help me. he told me he’d call me when he found it so i told him i was going inside because i had searched all the houses next to me (my street has tons of white buildings with entrances that resemble the photo). 

i waited over 20 minutes before accepting that he wasn’t going to call. i contacted uber customer support and they issued me a refund but kept the tip. i immediately called them and requested a full refund because why should they keep my money when i never got my food?? the customer service agent told me that she couldn’t get in contact with the driver, but according to their “tracker” it was the right address…i then say that their tracker is wrong because it is not the correct address and i can prove it. i told the agent to look up my address in satellite view on maps and compare it to the photo of the building. she never did and told me there was nothing else she could do. so then i asked to talk to her supervisor or someone who could do something else. she said no one was available and asked if i wanted a call back, which i agreed to. 

it’s been 12 hours already and no callback yet…i couldn’t find an email address for customer service for uber eats, but if anyone has any advice or any other way i can contact them it would be greatly appreciated. i plan to call the same line again if i don’t get a call back within 24hrs.

"cancelled order so i was out of town last week at a hotel about an hour and a half away from my house. my friend and i got something delivered through uber eats. two days ago i ordered burger king, only $22 worth of food, not a big deal. wasn't paying attention but as soon as the order sent i realized i never changed the address from the hotel to my house. i cancelled the order within couldn't have even been 5 seconds, probably 2 seconds.

 i filed the complaint for a refund and it said someone would call me shortly. i then ordered again for the right address. in a few minutes support called me and i explained what happened and they said i wasn't eligible for a refund. i asked to talk to a supervisor. they said they could put in the request and someone would call me within an hour but they were going to tell me the same thing.

about 30 minutes later i get the call. explain what happened. she said i couldn't get a refund because the driver was already dispatched and burger king already started preparing the order. i told her there is no way because i order quite often and i can see on the app it says connecting you to a driver, and when it does then it shows me their location and i can see them driving to the store. it was only 2 seconds. none of that happened. i even called the burger king to tell them that if they already started making the food to use it for another because i cancelled because of what the first support agent told me. the never even saw my order. they didn't know what i was talking about.

i was trying to explain all this to the supervisor and she kept saying the same thing. because i cancelled and the food was already being made and the driver was dispatched, no refund. she said if i would have called before cancelling we could have gotten it sorted out.

it doesn't make sense. so, if i would have actually let the food be made at that location and waste a drivers time she could have just changed my order to the burger king by my house and delivered to my address. but since i cancelled within 2 seconds and no food was wasted and no driver's time wasted, but because "" i cancelled"" , no refund.

it's not a big deal because it was only $22. the total was $32, i had a $10 tip, but i got a email of the new receipt and my bank info changed on my app, so i got the tip back. the logic just doesn't make sense.",2024-11-28 13:36:13,11,42,Reddit,UberEats

"what happens when a customer tip baits tldr: you reduce tip after delivery, the driver incurs expenses and has to lose money to deliver you the food.

tip baiting: when a customer reduces/removes their tip after delivery (regardless of circumstances) and had no intention of paying that tip.

why is it unique to uber eats: uber eats allows customers to reduce their tip up to an hour after delivery in most cases, while this is useful when a poor delivery has occurred, many customers have used this to their advantage by tip baiting.

why don't drivers avoid these obviously troll high tip offers: uber eats only shows the total amount expected to be paid: base fare + tip, as one number, driver accepting the offer has no idea how much is ""at risk"" of being taken back.

example: 10 mile trip, $20 tip bait, $2 base fare. driver occurs expenses such as gas, depreciation, maintainence etc. a ballpark estimate would be $4-5 for 10 miles. if customer pull back the tip, driver incurs expenses>base fare",2024-11-28 01:52:33,0,32,Reddit,UberEats

"still charged for tip i had an annoying, inconvenient, and frankly horrible experience tonight with my uber delivery driver and for the first time ever i edited my tip to $0.00. the driver was extremely rude and she couldn’t follow my very carefully laid out instructions(no one else has issues) and threatened to leave but i begged her to stay where she was and i drove over to where she was. i even started to apologize when i met up with her but she just started berating me in person so i just said thank you and got back in my car. i changed the tip amount to zero when i got back in my car, i physically saw the total amount change and even double checked it once i got back home. however, several hours later, after it’s too late to edit the tip i see that on my uber receipt i was charged for the original tip. customer service on the phone was completely useless they just kept telling me that i can only edit it an hour after delivery so my bank said they can dispute it after it posts. has anyone else ever had this issue? if so what was the solution?",2024-11-27 23:21:03,3,54,Reddit,UberEats

"questions about incorrect target order i used uber eats to order a non-grocery item from target for the first time and the driver delivered the wrong item.  it was close enough to what i wanted (even though i specified no substitutions) and there was a language barrier with the driver so i just kept it.  unfortunately, the invoice on the app still showed the item i ordered which cost significantly more than what i received.  i complained in the app and was asked to upload the upc of the item i received. uber immediately refunded the purchase price for the entire order, including the grocery items i ordered (these were delivered correctly).  they did not give instructions about how to return the item to target and i can't figure out how to contact anyone in customer service.  my questions are this:

1. how do i return the item--it seems unethical to keep it
2. how is it possible for the wrong item to get delivered and shown on the uber receipt? doesn't everything need to be scanned?
3. is the driver on the hook for the refunded items?  this seems unethical since i was not told how to return it and the driver has no recourse.
4. after they refunded me there was no way for me to leave a tip or a review for the driver.  does this refund affect the driver rating?
5. is the driver going to leave a flaming pile of dog poop on my doorstep because they didn't get a tip, especially if they were somehow charged for the incorrect item?

so this order i'm on the phone with a friend go to start scanning and she starts yelling sir walking up to me politely i'm like yes? and she snaps that i can only use card here not cash..okay yeah i understand, i plan too. she scoffs but backs up.

start scanning drop two items in a bag. glanced in my cart for a second waiting for the scanner to register their wait turn back to pick it up and she's pushing past to get the bag i just picked up yelling sir this is a weight scanner you have to leave it on the weight(mind you it will let you know itself if you didn't bag it to put it back).  so at this point i move my phone down to say something and she sees the app up. so she's like oh you're from uber? you can't do this here and starts pushing past to close it out
more out of curiosity then anything i'm like why not? she claims it shuts their system down and winn dixie can't do it. i try to ask about it as ive done it at this store before and another location eariler today and she snaps at me that i've never done it at winn dixie and yells at someone down the way 'do we do uber orders here' and who responds with we normally do them at the other registers. so at this point i'm thinking okay it must just be something she's used to but she tries again to take my bag and push me over saying see we done do that here and points to a doordash sign on the register(which is covered by like 5 other things but all you can read is drivers please scan...) saying again it shuts down their system and i must have thought i was at winn dixie.

at this point my patience is gone cause i've barely said anything she's trying to grab the stuff out of my hand and push me out the way and now saying i've imagined the other orders here. but i go to move to the other register saying ma'am things might have changed so i was asking but i'm not imagining things which she mouths off more and i hear her complain about me the entire time i'm checking out with the cashier.

i reached out to uber support, and they told me the driver had to contact them directly. eventually, they called the driver, confirmed he was indeed broken down, and told me my order would be canceled without any fees. i asked for a confirmation of the cancellation and got one in the chat.

however, i never received a notification of the cancellation. instead, about 30 minutes later, i got a notice saying my order had been reassigned to a new driver and would arrive another 30 minutes later – meaning i’d be getting my food 2.5 hours after placing the order.

at this point, i contacted support again and told them i wouldn’t be home anymore because i had plans and couldn’t wait that long. i asked them to cancel the order, explaining that my food would be cold after sitting for so long. they refused, saying the new driver had already picked up the food, and if i canceled, i’d still have to pay.

i tried negotiating with support, but they refused to cancel. eventually, the driver arrived at my place, called me several times, and reported a no-show because i wasn’t home anymore. i was charged for the order even though the situation wasn’t my fault.

"fake delivery address? why? i'm a driver, and i had the strangest order the other night i still can't wrap my head around. it was an order from taco bell, a really normal order. large drink, three food items. i start driving to the delivery location, not looking at the specifics until i get closer. i drive to the address, which was a really large apartment complex. like, the kind that has several large buildings, with the doors on the outside (so no code to get in or anything, you can walk right up to the door like a motel). thankfully, each building had a different street address number instead of them all sharing it like some complexes. (like, the complex itself had 6 or 7 buildings, but each building had its own address... something like 28755 rock street, 28765 rock street, etc). so i drove up to the correct building per the address listed.

but thats when i looked at the delivery instructions and also where it got weird. it said delivery type was ""hotel"", not apartment. then under hotel name was the name of a hotel about 20 minutes away. under ""apartment/suite"" was a number, which i thought was probably the apartment number- but it wasn't. i looked at the building it took me to, and it was all apartment numbers like ""355"", but the one in the app said ""12"". all the apartment numbers had 3 digits, and the specific building i was at had no numbers with 12 anywhere in them.

i looked then at the delivery notes, thinking maybe i'd find answers there. it said ""room 12 code 4111"". okay. well, theres no ""room 12"", nor anywhere to put a code. the delivery type wasnt the kind that needed a pin, so that couldnt be it. it was the motel-style doors, so theres no code to enter to get inside a building.

it was super weird. so i thought, okay, he put the wrong address in. maybe this will make sense with the hotel. i sit in my car and call the hotel he named. they inform me that no, their rooms are 4 digit numbers!! so theres no room 12, nor codes to get into anywhere. and to make sure, they also checked the customer name, and nope. no one staying at the hotel with that name.

i message the customer to ask for clarification, but no reply. i send another message to the customer with all the information discrepancies in case they dont know, and ask what apartment to deliver it to. still no reply. i call them, no reply. i end up waiting a few minutes, calling them every couple minutes. the order had a decent tip and i didn't want to lose it, but after another order popped up to do next, i couldn't keep waiting.

of course calling support was not really helpful. they responded by saying to just ""leave it in a safe place"". i asked how i'm supposed to do that when i don't even know where the customer lives. they didn't seem to understand, no matter how much i explained, that the address the customer gave me just simply did not exist.

eventually support just cancelled the order and told me to dispose the food. i gave the food to the teenager at the drive thru where i picked up my next order (i asked if he wanted cold taco bell and he was very excited and said yes hahaha). but i got a really stern email from uber the next day, going on about how i could get terminated for cancelling orders after pickup. i didn't cancel it though, support did. but i guess that doesn't make a difference if i do it or support does, it still says i did it in their system.

has this happened to anyone else?? i don't even know how this could happen. the ""room number"" did not match the building or the hotel!! and it was inputted into two different places in the app, so it wasn't a simple typo. i didn't get paid, of course, for that entire ordeal. i'm so not sure what the hell happened.",2024-11-26 04:10:05,1,6,Reddit,UberEats

(va) long story short i had two alcohol requests to truck stops which is a misdemeanor in virginia (va § 4.1-308) to deliver alcohol to public places. truck stops in particular are risky because truck drivers could drive soon after and get duis. both of these orders i would not even leave the store for (immediately returned) and negatively affected my cancellation rate. one of the customers was acting unruly in the chat and most likely gave me a dissatisfaction rating for “professionalism with customers” despite explaining the law to them as best as i could. if uber would change their app to prevent alcohol delivery to businesses and public places i think this app can be better for all of us. but until then, i’m staying far away from alcohol delivery.",2024-11-25 10:44:36,26,63,Reddit,UberEats

"flat tire, cold food delivered i place an order around 5:15, pick the standard delivery option and it shows my expected delivery @5:45, latest 6:25. cool. 

come 5:45, they’re still at the restaurant, still there at 6.. finally leaving around 6:20. i now have another delivery before mine as well. 

the driver makes it about half a mile, stops, then proceeds to sit there. after 30-40 mins, i ask what’s up, am told they got a flat tire and they’re just getting back on their way. these things happen but i’m also not a fan of paying for soggy old food, and mines going on 1.5 hours by now.

food delivered about 20 mins later, i say sorry to hear what happened but i’ll probably have to bring this up with uber, feeling the cold bag. 
at this point the driver starts yelling at me, asking what my problem is?, if i’m rational human being? if i understand stuff happens? and so on.. i was already walking away when this began. i told him if i’m receiving cold, old food, then that’s my problem. he yells some more but i really wasn’t interested in having this argument so i waved him off and walked inside. 

could tell most of the meal was mostly inedible as soon as i got in, and upon pulling it up in the app, i was confronted with the tip edit. i admit i wasn’t in the best mood at this point so i changed the $5 into $1. perhaps an asshole move but i spent many years as a server and have been stiffed after providing much better service than i’d received here. i wouldn’t have touched it but the driver’s “deal with it” outburst rubbed me the wrong way. 

i went on to report cold delivery to uber and was given a full refund. for context, i’ve ordered at least once per week for years and have only requested a refund on one other occasion.

"got scammed out of an uber eats promo by 3 live chat agents [https://imgur.com/a/lnp3cm8](https://imgur.com/a/lnp3cm8) <- link to screenshots of the chat with all 3 agents (subreddit is not letting me post images)  
  
i just spent half an hour being lied to by 3 uber eats live chat agents and essentially getting scammed out of a promo. i have no idea if i can get a resolution for this - if anyone has ideas, let me know, but atleast i am going to put my story here for awareness.

i'm an uber one member, and i've been getting 30% off takeout promos from uber eats in my email for several months now that have never shown up in my app. i finally contacted support about it. in short, here's what i got from each agent:

* **agent 1:** yes you are eligible for the promo, sorry the app glitches sometimes, just make an order and we'll apply the coupon after. no way he could get the promo to show on my app.

~ at this point i made an order that fit with the promo and got back on support chat to get the promo applied ~

* **agent 2:** first kept talking about refunds for no reason. then kept referring to a previous order, saying it's been over 48 hours so a coupon can't be applied, when the order i made was literally 10 minutes ago.
* **agent 3:** this one used several excuses on me:
   * first, he said my promo was expired. i proved to him through photos that it clearly wasn't, and a previous agent confirmed it.
   * then said i had a 30% off promo that expires dec 2nd, and i can use it on my next order (the email shows it expires tomorrow). i said this is wrong and your agent told me i can use it on this order
   * then he said he can't apply it because the order is live. during our convo it actually got delivered so i said it wasn't live anymore, so it could be applied.
   * then he said it had to be applied beforehand, and i can apply it next order instead. which obviously i can't because they don't show on the app, also your agent told me it would be applied after, guaranteed.

i'm fuming. at this point basically uber is lying by saying you have an offer but are not able to use it. and their agents are lying as well. i am absolutely done.

"""powered by uber"" had an issue the other day ordering from a local pizza restaurant that i have been wanting to try. i went directly to their website, and saw that there was both pick up and delivery options. i thought, sweet! delivery! and clicked through to the menu, placed my order, and input my credit card for payment. order placed, done deal, seemed easy. 

fast forward to my scheduled delivery time. i have an email from uber eats in my inbox, stating that my order had been picked up by the driver, sami, and that delivery had been completed. first, i did not know that i was interacting with uber eats on the restaurant's website. i've gone back and looked and could see that it wasn't clearly identified up front, unless you scrolled down to the bottom and saw in 8 point type ""powered by uber"" on the footer, and at checkout, and even then just a discreet ""uber eats"" at the top that immediately disappears when you scroll down to where you put in payment details.

at any rate, my delivery never arrived. i contacted the restaurant, they confirmed that the order was picked up, and that if i had an issue i should contact uber eats. i pressed on them a bit harder and they agreed to refund. 

i then contacted uber eats, since the restaurant informed me that it was clearly uber's fault. and this is where it gets stupid. i had screen shots of the receipts showing the order paid for, delivered, and then (insult to injury) a tip being paid out an hour later. uber's response - since i was contacting them via my phone number linked to my uber account - ""you didn't place the order, we have no record of it, therefore there is nothing we can do to help you."" this even after showing them receipts of the order and my notification from amex of the charge from ubereats.

what i found infuriating was that there was no interest on uber's part to research this and find out who the driver was that enjoyed a really good pizza and a decent 20% tip. i ""spoke"" (chatted) with two different uber reps and both said the same thing, then said that there would be email follow up (which of course never arrived). 

if anyone has any suggestions on how to contact uber to resolved this i would appreciate it, but the chat bros i interacted with were clearly not equipped or empowered to help me.

"worst service ever so i just placed an order through a restaurant's website not knowing they use uber eats as a third party. the order should have been around $27 dollars. after placing the order my credit card got charged $45 with no break down of the bill. i didn't get any confirmation by email or text (i had inputted my details already) and have no receipt whatsoever.

i called the restaurant and they told me to take it up with uber eats. uber eats has no contact number to call and i waited over an hour to ""connect to an agent"" for their chat service. after which i was told to send a message describing the issue and that they'd try getting back to me in 6-12 hours. i have no proof of this order except for my credit card charge (for $45) and the receipt from the restaurant (stapled to the order which confirms the $27 bill).

on top of that, the driver arrived late because his gps took him elsewhere. since i had no contact with the driver because i didn't order through an app or account (just directly from the restaurant's website), i had to stand outside in the cold and dark outside my building waving at every car that passed by. the driver finally saw me and i received my cold overpriced order.

i am beyond frustrated. i paid almost double what i was supposed to pay without prior notice or consent. no explanation as to why. no paper trail since i never received any kind of communication from uber eats.

i'll never ever ever ever order online again. i'd rather drive however long i need to and pick up my own order.

any advice if anyone's been through something similar before?


update: i got an email receipt 2 hours later and i can now see they added a tip, a service fee, delivery fee and tax (which i already expected of course) on top. so that all added up. i swear none of that showed up before i made payment. i won't pursue anything further, lesson learnt. never again.",2024-11-23 19:07:25,23,61,Reddit,UberEats

the girl picked it up quick and got it to our house pretty fast. i tipped super well, and the only thing request i had was that she put it on the bottom stair. i was super kind…

however, when the food got here, the staples on the bag had been removed (there was one still on there and we saw the holes.), and there was no sticker seal like usual. not to mention it looked just wrong compared to what the bags usually look like, and no receipt.

i brought the food in, and noticed it was so light. like when everything is in there, the bag is always heavy. 
so i quickly opened it to realize that the fries and every single ranch was missing. then when we opened our chicken box, there was 2 of each flavor missing.
at first i was like “it was probably wingstop messing up.”, but with the bag being open and the chicken, i think our driver took it.

 open a ticket but lie about the issue say ""i had a driver threaten me or food was left with a hate message"".

this will put a red flag on the ai chat and they will connect you with a real person and that person will ask for your phone number  (i have done this twice).

once they call you simply explained you lied to get a real customer

"delivery horror story i want to know if anything similar has happened to any other drivers, probably speaking to the women only on this one. 

i deliver overnight and i am always wary of my surroundings and i make sure i’m not in one area for too long, especially always deliver in the better areas although safety is not guaranteed anywhere tbh. 

but anyway as i was finishing up one night and just about to get home i get one last order for a single item from a coffee shop but it looked like the tip was $20. it was only a few miles into the next town too, and i obviously immediately accept it. as i was delivering i was thinking to myself why is this person putting such a hefty tip on such a small order. but then i saw it was leave at door so i wasn’t overthinking it, i figured i won’t have to interact with anyone, and maybe i’m just being tip baited at worst. 

unfortunately once i arrive to the door (last house on a dead end street, and the spot was a side door, absolutely no lighting except for a tiny light above the door) a young man peeks his head out. he’s talking like he’s high as a kite and i can barely hear a word he’s saying. i wasn’t sure if he was mentally challenged or drugged up but i was trying to be professional. i hand him his order and then he very quietly says “can you come inside and help me with something for that $20 tip?” then proceeds to pull out his pecker and inch closer. 

when i tell y’all i immediately ran back to my car feeling violated as hell, and i didn’t even three point turn, i just backed tf up out of that street as fast as i possibly could. i didn’t even realize i could drive in reverse so well under fight or flight circumstances but i’m glad i could. i immediately called uber and i admit i was crying and shaking. this man also reported me and canceled the order. after hearing me cry and speaking to what sounded like someone important in the safety department lol, uber give me the full amount of what the order was including tip. uber then blocked the customer for me, but i don’t think they are banned off the platform, and i didn’t bother with filing a report for a gray situation like this, where probably nothing would happen. but imagine feeling like you need mild compensation for experiencing something like this on the job, bc that’s how it felt lol. 

i had to take a break for a few days after this and now i’m sometimes on edge. just the other day some guy came outside to collect his order then starts small talk and complaining about his depression/divorce and then offered me $200 “just for some company” i’m sorry sir but your eyes are asking for more than just company. disgusting. but i got out of that situation so smoothly that he still left me $20 tip and no thumbs down thank god. 

i don’t plan to be doing this much longer thankfully. but where is the humanity? this is why women say they choose the bear. i don’t think those men understand how scary it is for y’all to approach us in any sexual way in the middle of the night when we’re simply supposed to be just delivering food. there is absolutely no work setting for me where i’m not going to get sexualized or borderline harassed by a man in some way. 

i’m just ranting and this happened months ago but like i just had to get it out. i still can’t believe it happened. i am just so grateful to be alright minus some visual and emotional scarring. and before some man comments “seriously don’t be so dramatic about how it affected you” honestly just don’t comment, it might seem like nothing to you but being flashed with genitalia in the middle of the night in a dark unknown place and literally being baited there with a tip is indeed a scary situation as a woman. and not only scary but incredibly dehumanizing.

"getting out of a customer service standard response loop? 
when i lived in a city, i used ubereats more often than i’d like to admit. if i had an issue with an order ie wrong item  or if the items came spilled or cold, i recall it would often take a few messages to break their standard customer service lines and get a resolution. they have since streamlined this and you can mostly get these things remedied by filling out a form. however, this doesn’t sort the issue out when it’s slightly more complicated than the form can compute. 

recently, i’ve got stuck in this customer service loop twice with both times them telling me the matter is final and will not be responded to again. the first time was actually me doing it on a friends account about an incident she reported to the police re her ubereats driver. i won’t go into details here but can if folk want to know more. 

second is more standard. on monday, i ordered food from a chain restaurant with another friend. we normally order on whatever delivery app has the best rates/deals. the veggie burger my friend orders can be made dairy free/vegan by removing some condiments. on justeat and deliveroo this is a tickbox but on uber, you need to “customise” it ie adding/removing condiments. nevertheless, even when using uber it comes vegan. she also customised it to have additional salad on it which was free of charge. this time the burger came with the non-vegan condiments so she could not eat it. i reported this to uber. uber kept saying they can’t do anything as the condiments didn’t cost money. they have not engaged with the fact the dish was wrong and if we were sitting in, this would be rectified or refunded. they keep focusing on the burger not having the extra salad, and how they cannot do anything as the extra salad was free, which is not the issue. it’s the inclusion of the condiment she cannot eat. what ways can i get through to them on this? we’ve sent photographs of the burger, our receipt and also the restaurants own website explaining how to make the burger dairy free.

"is it normal for the *alcohol background check to take so long? when i set up my (regular) ue delivery account about a month ago, i don't remember the amount of time it took for the background check but it was negligible, 24 hours or less i'm pretty sure.  shortly after i started taking deliveries, the app offered me the mastercard for instant payments so i got that.  it also offered me the card/account for shopping orders -i haven't pursued that yet but i might at some point.    
  
then it offered me the alcohol delivery option. even though i'm a near-100% teetotaler myself, i jumped right on it for a couple reasons: 1. from the various kinds of businesses i've worked as a server, i know that alcohol adds a whole other level of tip lucrativeness, and 2. i would rather safely bring alcohol to wherever people want to drink it than to have them drive home drunk from bars, or to stores to buy more after they've already been drinking.  

but my application has sat like this for at least a week, maybe 2.  is this unusual?  how much longer would you wait before trying to contact uber to see if something went wrong?

"such a scam in the way i live in seattle. i normally use uber eats to place order for pickup since a lot of restaurants really use uber eats for their takeout orders.

the problem is the seattle tax which a $13 order will end up $28 in delivery which is crazy.

however! today! a quick finger of mine didn’t place an order from “pick up” instead of delivery.  i realized the mistake and cancelled the order right away.  chipotle stated they don’t deal with order itself if it’s been ordered through uber eats.  yet uber eats shows chipotle picked up the order and already worked on the food within 2 minutes of offer “which seems super unlikely but okay?”…. and due to the order had been processed, a cancellation will subject to be the same as food had been made. so cancellation without delivery would still cost me full price of meal.

so the million dollar question is. if that’s the case for cancellation and since i already paid for the food. can i go pick up my food that i paid? nope! what uber eats meant is “no matter food had been made or not! the order had been gone through uber eats it means the transaction has been made and cancellation doesn’t matter! they charged me full price of food anyway”.

that leaves which a sour taste for me. if it’s not that i get my uber eats credits from my american express. i am most likely will never order through uber eats. not only the charge of food delivery is 200% from picking up myself.  the cancellation that food hasn’t even been made will charge full price is ridiculous.

it makes zero sense for me to even use the service because chipotle was walking distance to my place. and uber eats makes “delivery” as app default just simply good for their business and bad for users.",2024-11-18 18:33:31,0,19,Reddit,UberEats
"need help with uber eats refund issue – delivery driver misused code hi everyone,

i’m facing an issue with uber eats and could use some advice. i recently placed an order, and the delivery driver contacted me to inform me that the restaurant was closed. he then asked for the **delivery confirmation code** (the one you’re supposed to give when the driver arrives) to ""cancel"" the order. trusting him, i gave him the code.

now, the app has marked the order as delivered, and i’m unable to request a refund. when i contacted uber eats support via the app, they kept repeating the same thing: *“you gave the code, so the delivery is considered complete.”* they don’t seem to understand my situation, and i’m stuck without a refund for an order i never received.

"overnight ubereats and doordash issues. i’ve done ubereats for months. i’ve only done thursday to sunday or friday to sunday.
time 10pm - 6am.
i do this because of low traffic and fast food lobbies are closed so you only have to go thru drive thru.

issues i’ve noticed is the wait time for orders. 
even if i’m the first or only person in line or stuck in drive thru speaker order waiting to hear a person speak it always takes 5-20mins to receive the order. if i’m lucky some places have it done. i’ve seen many workers during this time take their time or on their phones while i wait for order. 
i still update app and customer but i can’t cancel order if this is like this everywhere. 

especially at night when fewer delivery drivers are out so you can get orders semi close or further. 
i get it’s my choice for choosing to work late. but i think both companies could be more understanding on the wait time and miles. the more time it takes the less money you make. the less drivers there are the more money for active drivers should make. 
just my opinion on working overnight.

as for app. gps doesn’t always take you to entrance.
wait time is also long since you have to use gate code, guard entrance, finding building and what floor or what side of buildings. that all is taking up time. if i could have only houses pop up on my orders it be great. but the ones with community guards you still have to wait 5 mins to enter. 
doordash entering the last 3 digits that’s already on the order to complete the order is annoying. ubereats doesn’t do that. plus i wanna get the order complete and leave not sit there and type in 3 digits than clock complete or take a pic of receipt either. especially while driving. time is already sensitive for drivers to get the delivery done to receive the next order. 
also doordash doesn’t let you communicate with customer unless they chat to you first. i was stuck at a gate with no gate code or don’t have enough info to deliver so customer doesn’t chat first unless your close enough to their location. again time sensitive not enough money for time. 

ubereats tips should have some mandatory tips. most my orders are leave at door yet doesn’t matter how fast or well i deliver i’ve had some no tippers. i just find it rude. especially walmart and 7/11 orders get no tippers. 

i live in vegas it’s pretty busy. doordash orders come in very slowly. actually when i do both apps and i choose to do an order on ubereats than doordash wants to give me an order at the same time.
it’s fine sometimes but it’s like i get no orders unless i have an order already on uber app which is weird. happens all the time. i’ve even waited 30mins for dd and nothing. but if i just do uber in 5-10 or 30 mins and take it boom doordash gives me an order. 
ubereats is has more orders and i’m glad i can deny orders that are 12miles for $5 but tips are never guaranteed. and when you do see and order that’s $11 for 5miles it’s not $11. that’s ubereats estimate with maybe tips. very misleading.

doordash is strict. can’t cancel too much or it will count against you. everywhere in my city is construction and 35mph to get to customer. i don’t think doordash knows how long it actually takes to get there cuz i keep getting late violations from 10mins - 30mins. 

oh i don’t know why some restaurant that are closed get orders. app is not friendly when letting them know. if you don’t speak to customer service they will count it against you if you cancel for good reason. 

on daylight savings time taco bell closed at 2am but there usually 24hr there system was down too and i had double orders. i select closed on ubereats and they count it against me even tho i don’t lie. i don’t get paid for it either. also at the time i didn’t know it’s best for customer to cancel order cuz if i cancel it does to another driver. but no comp for time and pay for a closed restaurant.
had a $40 order for wendy’s that’s closed. even says on window they close at that time. i chat with ubereats customer  service. no comp for time or miles. lost $40 and got nothing.

i don’t understand how delivery apps are so low on pay. it’s till a job with no real benefits and it’s contract. it really does take advantage of drivers. you can get more money from a part time job.

sorry i’m ranting but being new to all of this even reading reddits of people doing this for awhile will say it’s not worth it much.

also people tell others to get real jobs but you don’t know where in life they are and maybe they had no choice but to do delivery apps or their trying there best to find a job and not having luck. i’ve heard many customers, staff at restaurants and some drivers say job market has been more difficult. barely getting interviews no matter how many times you call and show interest. so don’t judge others if they only have this for income.

"ubereats scammed me i had a $30 promo code that i wanted to use. when i tried applying it, the app wasn’t working, so i reached out to customer support. the first agent told me to place the order anyway and reassured me that the promo code was still active. they said i could reach back out after placing the order, and the discount would be applied.

so, trusting them, i went ahead and placed the order. but when i contacted support again, the next agent told me the promo code was deactivated! when i tried explaining what the first agent said, they flat-out refused to help, saying promo codes are ""system generated."" i even asked to escalate the issue, but the agent just ended the chat on me.

i’m now stuck paying the full amount for an order i wouldn’t have placed otherwise. it’s such a shady tactic to get me to spend money. first, they tell me the code is active, and then, after the order is placed, they conveniently say it’s not valid anymore. to make things worse, they hung up on me when i tried to get some accountability.

respectfully i just want to say to the drivers. please i get it , if you need the money fair enough, but i paid a high as hell tip and priority to avoid this, and you don't have to accept my order. 

so just a word of warning. i will be lowering my tip once i get my food if the temperatures aren't literally perfect ( or in this case with ice cream, not melted at all.) and that's reasonable as i paid exorbitantly for them to not drive around with my food once they already picked it up. 

tldr: don't multi app on a very high tipper and then expect them to not lower their tip. just because i tip generously doesn't mean i don't get pretty annoyed at people spitting in the face of my generosity. 

edit: i'm a zoomer, we've failed the word literally, my point was simply ice cream soup isn't all that's neccesary for me to be upset. it being 15% melted also wouldn't be cool considering its 7 mins away and i paid for priority to ensure no stacked orders, and tipped high as hell to prevent a financial need to multiapp to survive.

(i realize they probably don't do that but at the time i was panicking). so i cancelled the order literally immediately after i placed it like within one minute and reordered a few minutes later and then realized what had happened. i figured it was fine it'll just go back to my card. i was charged for the food and uber eats just says sorry nothing we can do they started the food already(which is impossible). i had been just waiting for the money to go back on my card for the last few days because never in a million years would i have thought they'd charge me for it. does anyone know if this is uber eats doing this or the restaurant? ,2024-11-17 12:14:11,0,29,Reddit,UberEats
"uk mcdonald’s and deliveries - something has to be done i feel as though things have reached a point with mcdonald’s and deliveries in the uk where it simply can’t continue.

missing items, incorrect items, poor quality of items, missing sauces. the list goes on. 

i understand mistakes happen, but as a consumer they make it near on impossible to get compensation for these issues. i had an entire meal missing from an order a few weeks ago and the best uber could do was offer a refund of £1.80! mcdonald’s aren’t interested either when i contacted them.

the real kicker is when you order directly through the official mcdonald’s app rather than uber. there is absolutely no way to report missing items or make a complaint about anything at all. you are instructed to either call your delivery driver (a joke, because they only delivered what they were given) or use the ‘online assistant’ chat bot which ultimately just tells you to call the driver as well!

i did manage to get given an 0800 number which was a dedicated mcdonald’s uber eats helpline and the lady there promised me she would refund my order within 15 working days. 20 working days came and went. no refund. i ended up doing a chargeback through my bank.

"cancellation fun is it physically possible to cancel an order within five minutes using the ubereats desktop website if you don't know how to do it beforehand?  this is an honest question.

i just tried to cancel an order 30 seconds or so after having made it.  after using puzzle solving skills and advanced ai to work out how to cancel the order, i finally get to an online chatbot who points out that it took me more than five minutes to cancel my order.  after several attempts i finally manage to talk to a human being.  i point out that i wanted to cancel it after 30 seconds but ubereat's systems took more than 5 minutes to decipher and use and point out that they are intentionally hard to use to the extent that it's unrealistic to expect a regular person who hasn't done it before to be able to cancel an order within five minutes.  i accept the situation and simply ask for instructions on how to cancel an order in the future within five minutes.  the helpdesk guy gives me instructions for the mobile app i believe?  i point out that his instruction don't make sense and that i'm using a desktop computer and ask for instructions on how to cancel an order in the future.  instead of doing this he transfers me to another team.  in most companies this would mean you're going to speak to someone else immediately.  at ubereats they tell me that this means that they're going to try to respond to me somehow in 6 to 12 hours.

"account hacked there was a suspicious log in on my account and within a minute they changed my email address and phone number. now i cannot get back onto the account. my only worry is now they have my saved credit card information and also my home address on file. 

i tried to log in with my correct email and phone number and there is no order history at all on it. it's like a new account seeing as the hackers took over my old account and with my correct information, uber sees it as a new account.

i submitted a ticket with the ""new"" account but not sure if they can even track the old one. i have confirmation emails saying your account information has been updated to ""***.***.*****@gmail.com"" and your phone number is updated to "" +1***.-****."" which i doubt will help uber track it down.

does anyone have any experience with this and how it got resolved ? i feel like my chances are slim and i should just report my credit cards as stolen at this point. they haven't made any transactions yet or so it seems because i checked my attached credit cards and there is no pending transactions from uber.

"flat rate nightmares (also avoid walmart orders)  last night i signed up for the flat rate ""opportunity"" of $18.50/hour. usually, i love these. 

i accepted a delivery from walmart for their black friday deals. i get to walmart, have 2 other deliveries offered from same place, so i accept. 

the wait time to get the packages from walmart is nearly 2 hours. they are slammed and delivery drivers are definitely not on their priority list. i've had a few orders get cancelled, and i haven't delivered much yet (started 2 weeks ago) so my cancellation rate is a bit high. i don't want to cancel 3 more deliveries, so i wait. ..and wait. 

finally get the packages, start delivering. get finished four hours after i accept. 

i look at the compensation at it seems.. off. i do the math. (50.23 / 18.50 = 2.7!??) 

so i fire up live chat and am told i was paid corrected ""based on their maximum compensation policies"" 

i send the screen shot for the flat rate opportunity which states online ""flat rate of 18.50/hour for active time, from acceptance to completion"". i point this out and am told that i'm wrong, and he hopes i understand. anyone seen a maximum compensa

  
... i understand that's wage theft. (and that i live in a state that takes it pretty seriously.. i worked in payroll prior to becoming a stay at home mom looking for extra christmas money). 

so i call, and the nice lady that i speak to confirms that i've been paid incorrectly and i'm now on hold to be correctly paid. she then tries to transfer me to the department that can fix it. i'm currently being bounced around on hold. i get transferred again, and again, and again. still dealing with it. 

it would be super nice if they could get consistent. pay what they're supposed to (they had to have lost money, i delivered an iron, a tube of otc medication, and a book, to 3 different very rural addresses.... but i've delivered enough $4 orders to have made them plenty,) ",2024-11-15 10:46:24,8,16,Reddit,UberEats

i re-added my order to the cart and it showed the lower tax amount (exactly $0.16 less than the tax i was charged)

asked chat support, guy was rude and said my request for a refund is denied and then ended the chat on me (i was not asking for a refund i wanted him to explain the reason). started another chat, same result. called them, and the lady on the phone said that the fees change after, but nothing else changed so how did the tax change? she doesn’t have more info. then she said the fees can change depending on the size of the order.. i’m like what the drivers are weighing the orders before delivering? she doesn’t have more info…

so yeah, all i got was a reference number because apparently all they can do it log the issue and in her words “it’ll get handled”. i asked for an email address, they don’t do emails. i asked for a phone number, they don’t have any other numbers 

last time i was treated this way (with support ending the chat on me) was when my account was supposedly locked due to fraud (because i refunded a lot apparently? - all legit reasons by the way… missing this or incorrect that) 

honestly i’m so tired of this, i miss the old uber where every issue was handled by a real person in real time and was vetted there and then. none of this automated refund nonsense that then flags your account and puts it on hold without any communication

"a system error randomly charged me 50€ and support is unable to trace it hello everyone,



i'm reaching out here as the last resort because the uber eats support team has been unhelpful to help resolve this issue: last week, i placed a grocery order through uber eats valued at **32€.** however, i was charged over **50€** on my bank statement, which seems to be due to a system error. unfortunately, i didn't notice this overcharge at the time. two days later, i was charged again, but this time the correct amount of **32€**.



after noticing the second charge, i contacted uber eats support. they told me everything seemed ok from their side and suggested me to speak with my bank, and my bank advised me to cancel my card. digging deeper, i realized that the **50€** charge doesn't match any order details in the app, but the timestamp aligns perfectly with my order time. same hour and same exact minute.



i've reached out to uber support multiple times, but they seem confused and haven't been able to resolve the issue. they say they cannot understand my problem, they say that the system tells the charges are legit and after two days of trying to get this situation figured out they locked the ticket and stopped responding. if the **50€** charge happened at the exact same time i made my order it's obvious that it was uber eats.

"honest drivers versus thieves versus cancellation rate i'll keep it short and sweet. 

after my fourth failed mcdonald's pickup this week, due to a driver steeling the food, a conversation with technical support explained to me the following...

they have received hundreds of complaints from drivers about stolen deliveries. 

cancellation rate is increased every single time a driver cancels an order or every single time a customer cancels their delivery request. 

on friday last week, and for most of this year, my cancellation was 1%. right now, it's sitting at 4% because of thieves.

the solution is simple. 

anytime an order is stolen and a second or third driver is sent to the restaurant to pick it up. because the restaurant will refuse to make another of the same order for the same customer, if the driver contacts the customer to verify they have not received their delivery, the driver should have an option in the menu to resubmit the pickup so that the restaurant will be forced to remake the food. then that same driver can turn around and pick up that order and deliver it. that way the, the honest drivers are not penalized for a thief's actions. the current system is set up to cancel the order and add to that honest driver 's cancellation rate. the customer is disappointed and can complain and a driver is frustrated with having lost the tip and the income and the fuel to get to that restaurant.",2024-11-14 05:36:49,2,32,Reddit,UberEats

while waiting, i received another order. this order has the exact same instructions saying to call the same number that the first one had listed. 

i haven’t done uber in forever so i’m thinking it’s some sort of glitch or something. 

i get a voicemail from the second customer saying that they have been waiting 2 hours for their order. i check with the restaurant and they never received an order from the second person either. 

i end up giving up on waiting for uber support, cancel the orders, and end up calling uber support to find out what happened later on. 

i explained the situation to four different uber reps on the phone. the first one says they are going to document it, escalate it, investigate, etc. 

the second has me repeat the entire story to them again and doesn’t show a record of documentation. she puts me on hold while she figures out what to do. 

after waiting on hold for 5 minutes, the call goes through and someone else picks up. they have no idea who i am or my situation so i explain it a third time and they let me know that they need to transfer me again because they can’t verify the order details. 

the fourth person is able to verify on their end that sure enough, the same phone number was used in customer instructions. they also let me know that the order was placed by the restaurant. 

by the restaurant…

but they don’t have the order on their end… 

the uber rep agrees that the situation is weird and promises to escalate, investigate, document, etc. 

after we hang up, i get a standard notification from uber that my phone conversation was resolved. 

at this point, i’m thinking that uber doesn’t want to document it and investigate it because of liability. 

now i’m thinking to myself… was this some sort of elaborate fishing scheme? was the restaurant hacked? has this ever happened to anyone else before?",2024-11-14 01:53:29,4,9,Reddit,UberEats

"do they think i’m a driver when i order pickup?  i was wondering if it common for other customers using pickup to be treated poorly or to be asked for verification because they think you’re a driver not a customer.

i’m an ubereats customer (i even pay for uberone) and i often order food on the app because of the offers and deals, and i will still pick it up myself. in all my time of doing this i’ve never been asked to verify myself to a restaurant worker. however i can tell sometimes they think i’m a driver because they see “ubereats” so they don’t give me the same level of service as a customer.
anyways today the drive-thru worker asked my name at the speaker, again at the window and then asked to see my verification. i don’t have a common name (99th percentile i just looked it up) so if i was guessing a random name to steal food i would be very lucky. he then stared me down until i drove away and even stuck his head out the window to watch me for a bit for some reason. if i didn’t need to get home i would have pulled in and ate it in front of him just to say “look it was for me all along”.

"cancelation rate increasing when reporting stolen orders. is this legal???? hello, i'm a diamond driver who has always had a 0% cancelation rate. since about 3 months ago, evertytime the restaurant is closed, or the order is stolen by someone else, if i report it as stolen to customer service it affects my cancelation rate. 

i escalated the issue to a supervisor multiple times, they told me two things that shocked me.

one, yes, all cancellations that are done by anyone but the customer or restaurant affect your cancelation rating. customers and restaurants refuse to cancel because they lose money.

two, if your cancelation rate is over 20%, you will be deactivated.

so, if 20 of your last 100 trips are stolen, or the restaurant is closed, or the order will take 30+ minutes and you don't want to wait, if you cancel in any of these circumstances *you* as the driver will be deactivated 

this is what i'm not understanding correctly. isn't that illegal? you cannot fire me, or tear up a contractual agreement with me because you hired idiots that steal orders? or partner with restaurants that are too incompetent to confirm the pickup? how is that my problem? 

that is *not* grounds for termination of contract. does anyone know the legality around this?

this is incriseangly frustrating for me because uber pays for my tuition, and i need my cancelation rate under 5%. but how do i keep it under 5% when uber allows drivers to steal orders?",2024-11-12 22:46:01,31,148,Reddit,UberEats

here’s a quick recap: in 2019, uber went public and raised over $8.1 billion. but, by august of that year, the company’s revenue increased only by 2%, while expenses rose by $507m. this news caused a significant drop of over 20% in $uber shares, and investors filed a lawsuit shortly after.

now, uber has agreed to pay $200m to resolve these claims. the deadline to submit your claim is coming up on november 20, 2024, so if you were hit back then, make sure to check the details and file for your [payment here](https://11thestate.com/cases/uber-investor-settlement).

i don't know if it's a driver laziness so they don't have to carry it, or a restaurant making sure 'the drink doesn't get forgotten' and i don't know how to complain about it. 

do i thumbs down the restaurant? 

do i thumbs down the driver for bringing it to me like that? 

do i leave a note that just says ""do not put cold drink in bag with food"" (i'm assuming from what i've read that they won't take it out for food safety reasons, and don't even see it until dropping off the order anyways)

i know a shout in the void of reddit doesn't really accomplish any change, but i am trying to understand it better. 

thank you.

**edit:**  thanks everyone. i 100% understand it's a restaurant thing. i gave the restaurant 1* chose poorly packed, and put my comments about cold drinks in a warm bag.

i asked if it was the driver cause it was an order where the item was in a bag and the bag was knotted. i was unsure if this was a driver wanted to carry less and put it in the bag and tied a knot in the bag afterwards. there were no safety seals (this seems to be a restaurant thing as the item labels weren't sealing the container shut either. 

i don't usually request these types of drinks, but it was 8:30 at night and i hadn't eaten dinner and just literally wanted some orange chicken from panda, and if i spent $1 more i would hit free delivery so it was cheaper to get the drink than not. they had a $1 for a drink deal at the time. i had plenty of drinks in the fridge and normally don't order them, but i guess a free item means cold food. i used to order water bottle from canes, but they'd also put it in the bag, so i wound up just ordering a fountain drink instead and poured it out since i was trying to avoid soda. i didn't think this would be the case everywhere. 

i gave the driver a thumbs up and they got a $4.37 tip on a $15 order ($17 because the drink was $3 without the deal to get it for $1). thank you those of you who helped me understand the problem or share their anecdotes/solutions. some of you are clearly burnt out and i hope you find yourself a more fulfilling vocation instead.",2024-11-11 00:18:44,16,103,Reddit,UberEats

i also tried to tell them that as a customer, i think some of the rules they've put on drivers are unfair (like the new cancelation thing), and they straight up said ""you're not a driver so we don't care"". 

if i didn't receive the service for ""free"" (included with instacart), i wouldn't use it at all. 

i've never had this many problems with any of the other services. and i know the same people drive for most of them, where i live, so it's gotta be how the different apps/brand work.

because of this i have to leave my flat and go downstairs to the door to collect orders. this is fine and i always select meet at door for my orders

i have had some phone provider issues today because they are doing work in my area so taking calls (not coming through sometimes) has been a problem. so i left a note for my driver saying not ring me and i would keep an eye out and be at the door ready for them and if i wasn’t then he should ring the door bell for my flat 

so i watch and i see their car arrive on the app. i quickly put on my dressing gown and rush downstairs and open the front door to the building

i stand there for maybe 2 minutes and begin to wonder where they are. this happens sometimes where the app will show them arriving when they are actually still at the top of the road or something 

in my slippers i make my way to the front of the garden and peer out at the street to make sure they aren’t lost trying to find the right house. there are a fair amount of cars  and i don’t immediately see anyone

i look around and wait again for couple of minutes and begin wondering if perhaps my order has been stolen or they have gone to the wrong building ( this has happened before)

then i finally spot about 6 houses down there is a car with its rear lights on. again in my slippers i walk down the road and as i get closer i see a man sat on his phone who spots me in the side mirror walking down with my phone and waves. i wave back and he gets out and says ‘hi’ and goes to get the food out from the back seat

i say hi back and smile as i’m not overly bothered about the situation. as he gets his food out he starts ranting ‘i’ve been sat here for 5 minutes now trying to ring’. i pointed out the note and that the order said to meet at door but he just ignored me and got back in his car and drove off

"single sauce order conspiracy i live in the dormitories at a university, where ordering food on a late, stoney friday night is very common for many people who live here. 

however, during the day, usually around 2pm, a bunch of uber delivery men drop off orders of one sauce, one can of drink or one banana. no one from my building actually orders these things. sometimes there are over 20 of these single sauce orders that get dropped off at the building every afternoon.

its really weird, and i am trying to figure out why / who is making these orders. surely the restaurants who put these orders through think something is up? is it a way for the uber drivers to earn rewards when times are quiet? its super annoying and causes a lot of littering. i wonder if anyone knows if this is a common thing or whats going on...

"just had a 1 hour long heated debate with my friend about tipping etiquette in a gig economy i did uber eats years ago, before i got into my new profession, and was always of the mindset that 'tipping is not obligatory, but is always appreciated' whenever i was doing my deliveries. that way, i was never disappointed and always knew how much money to expect to make based off the set rates for distance... 

now that i'm working and making better money, i always tip $3 minimum because i know what a pain in the ass it is to go up 5 flights of stairs when an elevator is out and the person should realistically just meet you in the lobby to be fair. anyway, my friend has been too lazy for the last week or so and has been ordering delivery constantly, apparently, and since we were hanging out tonight, he ordered for us tonight. i told him, add a $3 tip on for me and i'll give him the change later, and he scoffed, saying how he doesn't tip and me doing so was stupid. 

basically, his mentality is that of many... uber adds on multiple fees, so therefore, he shouldn't have to tip his driver, who makes $3 because it isn't his problem or his responsibility to pay uber's employees a living wage, yet, he'll order twice a day for a week or better. i understand, tips add up, but he obviously isn't hurting, if he can afford to order $650 worth of food in a week... i was just like, what is $1? i tried to explain to him, that many people use delivery services because they're elderly, disabled, or new moms home with a child and that they're dependent on them, so yes, a driver should get a tip, just like a waitress or a bartender because i see them delivering huge grocery orders and if the person ordering is part of uber eats+, doordash premium, etc that they aren't getting that $7-$10 delivery fee... this still didn't register with him and his argument was that, it's the stockholders getting rich off the fees, to which i just replied, yes because they're the ones that invest and gave loans to the company and the company should get the majority of the rest of the money because they carry the risk... that is how capitalism works.

i had hoped that explaining this to him would make him see the light, but no, of course not... he just doubled down and i'm like, well, when they eventually stop taking your order because you're such a cheap f#ck, enjoy having to get up off your fat ass in -18c weather to go out and walk 20 minutes to get your midnight mcdonalds.",2024-11-10 02:22:20,1,36,Reddit,UberEats

we’re sorry to hear about your experience with order# 40e2d. i’ve arranged a refund for your order, which should be returned to your account typically within 3-5 business days.

further regarding the in-app pricing, i'd like to inform you that when you order through our app, the in-app prices may be different than in-store prices. you can see the in-app prices when you build your order for pickup or delivery, and these prices may not match the prices on a printed label or printed receipt included by the store with the order.
we appreciate your understanding and we hope to offer you a better experience on your next order.

"a restaurant being closed or another driver picking up an order now affects our cancelation rate.  i had gone to pick up an order, and the restaurant said that 4 or 5 delivery drivers have already come by to pick up the same order, and the order isn't there. i called uber support to let them know that the order had already been picked up so they could cancel it on their end. the representative told me that  i could just cancel it on my end. i asked if it would affect my cancelation rate, and she said only a little bit. i told her as far as i know, when someone has already picked up an order or if the restaurant is closed, uber support can cancel it on there end so it doesn't affect our cancelation rate and we get compensated for driving to the location to pick up the order.  she pretty much avoided what i was asking and kept telling me i just need to do more deliveries to bring the percentage down. 

anyway, i ended up calling again to speak with someone else. the 2nd representative was really nice. he said he also thinks it's not fair for the drivers to cancel an order that isn't available to be picked up. however, those are the new guidelines, and it's out of their control.

so, moving forward, we have to be the ones to call the customer and have them cancel their order so it doesn't affect our rates.

"how i know it’s not the drivers stealing food  when i first started this gig pretty much every restaurant left the food out for us to pick up. now the only ones left who do are digital kitchens. these are places the average person wouldn’t know it existed unless they were a driver.  only people in and out of there are drivers and i’ve never showed up to a stolen order there.  

yet the restaurants where most ‘driver theft’ seems to happen is cheap fast food places.  we pick up from nice restaurants all the time. why would we steal $10 worth of wendy’s?  

another clue it’s not the drivers is the evolution of the interaction with these restaurants and fast food places.  after they started putting behind counter they eliminated any random opportunists taking the food.  they started asking us for names to verify and all was good for 6 months or so.  then all of a sudden stolen orders start happening again and the restaurants start asking us to show our phones. now why would the name not be good enough for the restaurant.  because there is another person out there that knows the name - the customer. 

imo most stolen orders come from 1 of 3 things. 

1) customer orders what he wants. picks it up himself and claims refund from uber when it’s not delivered. 

2) restaurant worker messes up in some way.  hands order to wrong driver and gets delivered to wrong person (kind of on driver too but not malicious theft either).  forgets to make it.  something… they won’t admit fault because these are mostly younger people working these places not wanting to get in trouble. 

3) some technical difficulty the order is never made. shift change or role change in restaurant.  new person has no clue why they don’t have it and assumes another driver took it. since that’s the trope on social media 

i’d say the 4th likelihood scenario is a driver took it.   maybe has decided to quit. doesn’t care about deactivation anymore and says f it and take dinner home with him on his last day. but we’re not taking wendy’s trust me. they’re taking some steaks home with them the last day ",2024-11-07 15:05:10,5,48,Reddit,UberEats

i wanted to tell this story because i've been a long-time user of ubereats and i've noticed in just 12 months the customer service has gone from fine to completely unusable.

i tried to use the auto-pop up menu in the ubereats app to flag i hadn't got my order, but instead, they just kept asking if i wanted to cancel my order. they said if i cancelled i would pay **the entire cost of the order i hadn't got as a ""service fee.""**

this happened over and over again in a loop, until i asked to speak to a human agent. finally, i spoke to someone, they checked the order and then said someone would get back to me within 24 hours.

just to be clear - i was standing at my door, $60 poorer, without my food and i was being told that someone would get back to me within 24 hours.

better yet - **no one got back to me!** ever. not in the app. not in my emails. not in spam. nowhere. they took my money and ran, without ever giving me my order or contacting me again.

the driver chose to wait at lidl, a supermarket for 10min straight so i thought that maybe he had another order or something.

he ended up going to the mcdonald’s for the order so i thought i was finally getting my order after 30min maybe?

he went back to the lidl which is on the opposite side of where i live btw and stayed there for another 10min then finally delivered it :/

worst of all this is my first day working as an uber eats delivery guy. this fool put me in the middle of nowhere at 2:00 a.m. in the morning. i was scared i was gonna get robbed or killed. then he's gonna report me even though he gave me the wrong address, twice! i'm just glad he canceled the order before i did. makes it easier for me to call him a scumbag while eating his food and counting my money haul. screw these types of customers. bro barely gave me advice when i was asking about him, too. he said ""i am at a welcome center"" but forced me to look up which one and i had to go down a freaking list! absolute clown.",2024-11-06 02:24:05,34,26,Reddit,UberEats

spoke to uber eats in chat, so rude and useless. told me i'm not entitled to a refund because apparently i have had multiple. the last time i requested a refund was in 2022 for burnt charcoal pizza!! ended up contacting them through the phone using riders support as we don't have a phone customer service line in the uk. the guy on the phone shouted at me and hung up on me. tried calling the restaurant, exact same thing. i was shouted at and accused of lying by a guy who barely spoke english. meanwhile i haven't eaten for 6 days now because i'm still nauseous.

i head home and a 2nd order comes through also paying well, and from the same restaurant. i shouldn't have accepted it, but i did. i turn around and drive a few miles back to this restaurant, and this time all the workers laugh in my face saying it has already been picked up. they think it's hilarious. even the cooks laughing when the window worker shared the news to everybody. i couldn't deal with another cancelation against my account along with everybody making fun of me so i made a bad choice. i asked for a $1 drink and a bag. i put the drink in the bag and ""ghost delivered"" it to the customer. took a photo of the ""full"" bag in front of the customers door and received the entire $20 rate instead of taking a cancelation and not getting paid plus potentially being deactivated/fired.

i don't want to steal from customers. but because another driver stole the customers food and the restaurant workers won't do anything to stop it i was just fed up. go ahead and down vote me and say rude things to me, but this is just bullsh*t. uber will fire/deactivate us because somebody else steals food, and there is nothing we can do about it. even if support cancels the ride, the cancelation goes against the driver.

"i think uber is playing chess while customers and drivers are playing checkers. and they’re being a grandmaster strategist. we’re constantly seeing arguments between customers and drivers. drivers claiming lack of tips and customers feeling they paid enough of fees for them not to tip. as someone who has driven and orders from, both are absolutely true. as a driver you constantly see orders with no tip or little ones with 5+ miles. it’s not worth your time, gas, wear and tear on your vehicle. at the same time, as a customer, uber tacks you on fees that drive up your $15 order to $25. naturally as a customer you wouldn’t feel inclined to tip more or anything. so what happens? that order shows up as a $2 for x amount of miles for the driver. what’s happening in the process? uber is wiping their hands clean. screw over the driver and customer. pitting us against each other knowing that drivers will complain with the lack of tips because ubers base pay was trash. and customers blaming drivers for not getting their orders on time or late because it was grouped with multiple orders. uber is a corporation and like any other, its employees are just a number waiting to be replaced by another. and all they care about from the customer is their money and how to squeeze the most from them. 

i’ve honestly become tired of arguing for both sides with past posts. we’re literally on the same team and should be focusing on the actual problem of which is uber. i’ve only scratched the surface on ubers scummy practices but i just hope in the near future we can start holding uber accountable.

restaurant instructions has nothing about bags, and i've never had an issue before with them. told the supervisor i'm not with doordash, it's ubereats and i'm just a pickup driver. she says she doesn't care, it's all the same, and i need to have a bag or i need to leave and cancel the order so another driver can pick up.

"uber eats chaotic customer service experience  today, in greenville county, sc, i ordered via uber eats, placing the order at 12:00pm. 

shortly after placing the order, the uber eats tracker showed my driver stopping at the restaurant i’d ordered from, about 12:10-12:15pm. 
the driver then proceeded to drive to a neighborhood opposite my direction, and then to transfer my order to a different driver. 

40-50minutes later, the second driver transfers my order back to the original driver. 

2 hours after my order had been placed, driver no. 1 called to tell me that the restaurant was “clearly closed on sundays,” so i’d have to cancel. 

i was grateful not to be charged for the food i didn’t get for this order, but had been forced to wait on an order for two hours, although the driver could have told me the restaurant was closed within 15 minutes of my placing the order at 12pm. 

chatted with customer service. they said that they had done all that could be done, no explanation, no accountability, no compensation for this mishap of negligence. 

but, wait! the story isn’t even over yet! 

i then placed a second order from a different restaurant via ubereats.
the food was soggy, we didn’t receive one of our drinks. we got compensated 5 dollars for this, but the total for those items was $11.29. i’m grateful for the $5 uber eats credit. 

our driver (not either of the two from earlier), came to bring us the order and my brother answered the door. driver refused to speak at all. the driver also refused a $9 tip in cash, rolling their eyes, turning around and leaving. 

as i pulled into the driveway, the driver was backing out of my driveway but stopping for 2-3 seconds and then moving forward again. i thought she might have just been arriving, and couldn’t find the house because this happens a lot where i live. i pulled up and rolled down my passenger window to ask if she needed help finding the house, but before i could finish asking, she said to me angrily “im just trying to back out!” i said “ok, i apologize.” 
then she stared at me angrily for 2-3 seconds, then began backing her car while saying “i’m just trying to back out! god! leave me alone!” 
i didn’t say anything else to the driver. just waited quietly for her to pull out. 

i tried explaining this situation all day with uber eats chat to no not much avail, and now have sent an email.

"uber eats is illegally refusing ebt snap eligible items for ebt purchase edit: after arguing with customer service on the app (and being told multiple different things, being told i'm wrong, and they can't do anything to help, also being told i don't understand the system and it must be my fault, even having both my bank and local calfresh snap office review my receipt to verify and be on chat with uber eats customer service with me to explain what was going on what they needed and what appropriate next steps are/the laws about this situation,  just to be disrespected and disconnected as well) i finally got a call today. an actual phone call. uber contacted me apologizing for the discrepancy. they explained i was correct, their customer service agents i spoke with would be trained again on how to handle this issue. 
basically she explained that when applying a promo, it happened somehow. tech was notified about it. apparently it's not uncommon either because i've seen multiple posts online about the same issue for months now. i guess most people don't hear anything back unless they raise a big enough stink about it. 

they apologized to me, corrected the discrepancy, and told me they'd fix the issue so it doesn't happen again. i'm not going to use it again though it's not worth it to me. i hope this can be of help in the future to anyone going through similar. 


ebt is accepted on their platform. multiple times now they've refused ebt for items with the icon that the store and ebt verified were eligible. 

when i reach out to customer service to figure out why, they basically string me along with a bunch of bullsh!t saying that my items must not have been approved, but then can't tell me what terms weren't. they'll disconnect, they'll tell me ""call your bank"". but my bank, and ebt card, tell me that it needs to be brought up with my receipt to the point of purchase. when i show them this they act like they didn't see my screenshots or read what i said at all. basically just throwing me to the next agent and then acting like they can't do anything about it. they even try to tell me my receipt from them is incorrect but they can't give me a correct one.

"uber eats - riders stealing groceries order update: 24hrs on and  uber has not responded to the ticket raised regarding the order. i will wait until tomorrow and dispute it from paypal.

———

ok, let me understand what happened here.

i put an order in for a few items from sainsbury’s. i see in the app that the delivery is split between two riders. the first one arrives relatively fast and delivers about 30 percent of the order. he tells me that the remainder of the order is coming with another rider, asks me my pin which i tell him, and leaves. i check the app and see the other rider is about 5 minutes behind. i check the tracking map after about 3-4 minutes and i can see the other rider about 50m away from my apartment building, i keep my eyes on the map as it struck me as interesting that albeit shown being on a scooter (not bike), he is going the wrong way in a one way street. the driver seems static on the map for some time and after a couple of minutes the tracking screen disappears on the app and i get a notification that my order was complete.

i click “help” on the app and get connected to the driver. although i have i note female in the driver’s picture, a male voice picks up. i ask him where is my order and he says “sorry brother, i went to sainsbury’s and they told me that the first driver picked up everything”

understanding there is no point in engaging in a conversation with him i hang up the phone to try to get some help from uber eats support. i explained the situation to them over texts, sending pictures of the items that arrived and sending screenshots from the receipt having marked all the items that are missing.

can someone explain how this scam works? were the drivers working together? how did the second driver “complete” the order without my pin? did the other driver give it to him?

what are my chances of getting a refund for all this?? it feels really shitty being thieved of about 50 pounds worth of stuff.

"waste of money so i've had two bad incidents with ubereats in the last month. in early october, i decided to get groceries through the app to save me some time. i placed my order and indicated which items i would not want replaced if they're not in stock at the store. a driver took my order and once at the store indicated to me that smaller pack of spinach and dressing was not available -- i had indicated i would rather a refund than the replacement item. he then continues to bombard me with 5 requests to replace the items with suggestions from uber, i declined all of them. after 30-35 minutes, when i received my delivery, i see a large pack of organic arugula and a completely random large jar of sauce in the bag. the surcharge was almost $20. im a broke college student, so thats a lot for me. when i asked the support staff if theres anything they can do, they said ""our regulations don't allow such practices and we take your concern seriously"". bs! i can't even return those items at the store since the they ask for the original payment method... then there was today, i thought after finishing all my work, i'll treat myself to take-out. i had heard of this local joint and decided to order fish and chips from there. when i received the order, which cost $30 after tax, i received a undercooked, practically raw battered fish and a handful of burnt fries. the tartar sauce that was mentioned in the description, ya.. they didn't give me that either. i asked the support staff if at the very minimum credit was possible, at the very least i could spend my money else where. to which they said ""the behavior you described is unacceptable.. this is very deeply important to uber.. issuing a refund is not an option on this matter"". im sorry but this is fuckin ridiculous now.. like there's no way me receiving raw, unediable food is my fault.. or the uber guy giving me random items without my acceptance is my fault either. anyone else have similar occurances?",2024-11-03 16:33:40,9,28,Reddit,UberEats

"tipping question as a customer? hello!! i am posting as a customer (i use ubereats religiously). i will always tip 28%-30%, but does this seem like an appropriate amount? like what makes it worth it to you as a driver? sometimes i’ll order from a restaurant that’s two miles away or sometimes i’ll order from one that’s 15 miles away and i’ll tip the same. 

and can drivers see “history”? for example, i live in a pretty large town but i always get the same two drivers… i was wondering if maybe they accept the order because of my location. i always think it’s awesome because they are both really great delivery drivers (they will text me when they are on their way or if there is traffic slowing them down etc… they worked through a hurricane and delivered food to me several days when i didn’t have power and i tipped extra, of course) i also have a disability which makes it hard for me to go out sometimes when my disease is in flare. i swear, ubereats delivery has saved me from a lot of hassle. 

i am grateful i can pay extra to have my food delivered and i want to make sure that i am staying up to date with what the what is considered a “good” tip.

1. i'm sick of delivery services allowing drivers to make multiple deliveries at the same time just so they can ""make a decent wage"" instead of of the delivery services just paying drivers a decent wage. this method doesn't work and makes my food take so long that it is cold and soggy by the time it gets to my door.

2. i don't get updated when my order is taking longer than expected and the wait time just keeps updating getting longer and longer every time i open the app....like have some transparency. 

3. customer service means absolutely nothing to these companies and you have to fight your way through an incompetent robot just to speak to an agent and even then they seem incapable of unwilling  to give you any reasonable reason or solution.

"ubereats charged me twice for an order / removed discounted amount on second charge just as the title states, i placed a grocery order last week, on wednesday 10/30/24 to be delivered on fri 11/1/24 8:00am - 9:00am delivery window. ue was offering a promo of  40% off at a particular grocery, so my partner and i chose food from this chain and placed the order. 

for reasons unknown to me, the order was late - driver headed to store at around 8:30am (when i checked the app/screenshots show), he pays for order at 9:50am (per store receipt) and delivers at approx. 10:15am. the total (including gratuity) was $59.37 which was charged to our credit card. 

today, we looked at our online banking and see two charges from ubereats:
1. the original charge of $59.37 (pending) and 
2. an additional charge of $86.97 (what the order would have been on ubereats without the discount).

we’ve messaged with 3 different csrs, and not one can give a legit reason for the additional charge/change in price. each continues to ask for a screenshot of the coupon that was originally applied and that they can’t help us without it. 

by chance, can anyone here provide some insight into this? goes without saying, but uber & ubereats have lost my business over this.

"ubereats should stop giving out double orders i started doordashing and delivering for ubereats about a month ago and figured i would do a little experiment and order ubereats tonight to see what it was like from the customers perspective! it's been years since i've used a delivery app.

well i placed my order by 6:30pm, left a good tip, immediately was assigned to a driver, however, the driver was doing a double order. i did not get my food until 8:10pm tonight!! 

these delivery food apps are extremely expensive for the customer! and it's honestly so wrong that uber doubles up orders and often delivers to the person who ordered the food first, last. making all the money spent essentially not worth it.

i had this issue last night delivering when i did my first double uber eats order, the lady who i picked up for first was getting ice and i wasn't going to reach her house for another hour so i called customer service to see if i could go to her address first but they said no! luckily her ice was fine, but i'm not going to be accepting double orders anymore unless it's super low miles and i unfortunately probably won't be ordering off uber eats again, because you never know if the driver you get is going to be getting a double order or not.

i'm fine with special requests or other information that is not on the description for delivery. drivers can't see notes prior to confirming pick up so that would be fine.

  i am highly disappointed and confused all at the same time.  every time you accept a trip, it shouldn’t let another driver accept it.  every time a trip has been accepted by another driver, it always tells me “this trip is no longer available” which i see all the time i’m doing uber!  how could have someone else gotten the same trip?  even the customer didn’t receive any notifications of another driver picking up their order for delivery!  i have no idea what just happened!  what did just happen?

"new flat rate for delivery drivers i have one concern about this. i noticed that when you’re on the flat rate opportunity, the estimated tips don’t show up when the order pops up. what does this mean? is uber not encouraging tips when you’re on flat rate or not saying you’re likely to get tips? if so, how do you tell if driving on flat rate is a better deal than the alternative, and if it’s worth it?

"fake delivery alert - my uber eats nightmare!! just wanted to share a pretty frustrating experience i recently had with uber eats that left me both disappointed and baffled. it’s crazy how some people think they can get away with dishonesty!

so, i placed an order and was eagerly waiting for my delivery. the driver was supposed to drop it off at my building, but instead, he went to the next building over. he took a photo of my order being ""delivered"" there and then took the food with him!

when i checked the delivery photo, i noticed it was taken in front of the wrong building – not even mine! what’s even more bizarre was that there was no buzzer code ring—he didn’t even try to reach me.  
thinking it was a simple mix-up, i tried to call the driver, hoping he’d realize the mistake and swing back. at first, he denied anything was wrong, insisting he had delivered it to the right place. after a bit of back and forth, he suddenly blocked my number, leaving me with no food, no way to reach him, and a lot of frustration.  
  
luckily, the building he tried to attempt fake delivery, shares the same management as mine. the office staff were incredibly helpful and managed to track down what had really happened.

what frustrates me is that incidents like this can unfairly lead to the entire indian community being blamed for the actions of a few individuals. it’s disappointing to see hardworking people judged because of the misdeeds of others. it’s a shame that a few individuals tarnish the reputation of a whole group.

"ubereats has shadow banned me from refunds / reporting issues with orders. tl/dr at the end.

i work crazy hours and i use ubereats all the time and i have been for at least 8 or so yrs, i know.. unhealthy, expensive etc. i am aware and i generally order healthier options and i do have a decent job which allows me to spend the extra on ordering in. i also use uber to get to and from work 4 days a week, every week.

anyway, my issue.

as i said i use ubereats a lot. so i'm bound to have orders that are messed up. missing items, wrong items, incorrect toppings, etc (main issue is completely missing items).

example: i'll order a combo and i'll be missing the side or the drink or an extra sandwich or burger.

i'm a person that believes i should receive what i pay for. so, when i'm completely missing an item i'm going to justifiably report this as missing. i will specifically pick just the missing item and put through that it's missing. i'll gladly take uber cash or a refund, doesn't matter. but if i'm missing what i paid for i expect it to be refunded.

well, i noticed that a lot of times instead of just refunding the say $5 item out of a $20+ order, they will refund the entire order. i have specifically stated in my missing item requests even ""everything else was fine please do not refund other items"" and they will refund my entire order still.

now, i have worked in a similar field in the past and i know things like this could flag my account as taking advantage of refunds or something like that. so, i have even called the customer support line and spoke to 3rd level supervisors at least 4-5 times to tell them this keeps happening and i do not want the entire order refunded, i only expect the missing item to be refunded.

shadow ban?

so now no matter what my issue is if i report a missing item, wrong item (completely wrong order even) etc i instantly get declined anything, it tells me i'm not eligible for a refund for my missing item and just closes the door on it. then i have to reach out to chat support and all they do is send that same copy and pasted message over and over and over to me and do nothing. even if i have photos to support the issue.

so now, no matter what i could get a completely wrong order or be missing an item i have no recourse to have it corrected.

what am i supposed to do? i just had an order that was $45 and it was completely wrong, i sent an image etc and they just completely deny my refund and no one here will eat the food we did receive.

**tl/dr:**

**the restaurants in my area constantly mess up orders and i get missing items about 10% to 20% of the time, over the years this has built up enough reports / refund requests due to this that i believe i'm shadow banned from even requesting refunds. i spend at least $1000 a month w/ uber between travel to work and food. my refunds are now instantly denied and tells me i'm not eligible even when the order is completely wrong w/ photos etc. chat support copy and pastes a denial response and does nothing.**",2024-11-01 15:37:37,0,26,Reddit,UberEats
"ubereats driver stole my lunch! today, i placed an online order with a local sandwich shop that uses ubereats drivers to deliver meals. after 90 minutes of not receiving my meal, i called the shop and was told that the ubereats driver picked it up already.

after 30 more minutes, the tracker status on the app changed from ""order received"" to ""meal delivered"". i waited 5 more minutes in case the driver was onsite and simply updated his app.

when the ubereats did not appear at my office, i called the sandwich shop back and let them know that i did not receive a phone call, text, nor my meal. the manager was sympathetic and said they'd quickly prepare another meal and one of their store employees would deliver it. within 15 minutes, the store employee placed the order in my hands.

prior to today, i've had some really dicey ubereats experiences. today is my last.

"walmart ghost deliveries  just when i was ready to log off and call it quits for the day. i had a walmart offer for $58.19. it was for 5 different customers going only 21 miles total. i tapped it as quickly as i saw it and made the turn to head toward walmart, 4 miles from my location. 

at a red light, i previewed the order information. it looked like it was something very reasonable to do for that amount of money. 

1 mile from walmart, the app chimed the canceled order notification. a sense of disappointment flowed through me but i figured i still had at least 4 orders and would likely still make at least 40 bucks.

three blocks from walmart, the app chimed the canceled order notification yet again. followed less than a block down by a third canceled order. now. i was starting to get concerned. 

as i was pulling into the parking lot of walmart to pick up their last two remaining orders, they canceled order chime happened again. i was at this point quite disturbed or at least mildly upset.

i realized that that $58.19 was long gone. 

i proceeded to check in and wait for the walmart employee to come out with the order. 

and then a thought occurred to me. 99% of all walmart delivery offers are at most $2 to $3 including tip, driving to three or four locations over a distance of 10 to 20 mi. 

maybe it was paranoia that made me think that perhaps uber had decided to start tricking us by offering multiple deliveries for a huge tip amount and then deleting them one by one as described above. could it even be a thing? would they stoop so low just to deliver a non-paying zero tip delivery? 

i wouldn't bet on it, nor would i bet against it.

and then the walmart employee showed up without any cart or merchandise or groceries. i rolled down my window and the woman told me that the orders that i was supposed to pick up had already been picked up by someone else. a full hour before i arrived. 

i mentioned to her that i initially had five deliveries. she nodded and said that all five deliveries were picked up by that same driver an hour ago. she told me that all five customers had called her asking where the hell their stuff was. that they couldn't get in touch with uber or the driver who picked it up. 

this is why it is so infuriating and frustrating as hell for drivers who have honesty and integrity who arrive to pick up something that someone else took and stole. 

my mind went places that were unjustified yet were a completely logical conclusion based on what i have read in various postings in this forum. 

i can't imagine why anyone would want to steal five sets of groceries from walmart. 

i would hope that uber is going to take some serious steps against this thief, if not just in the defense of the customers or walmarts, but in the defense of the drivers who work with integrity and honesty.",2024-10-31 21:19:53,8,7,Reddit,UberEats

you've been driving all night. you stop at a hotel and check in. you're hungry but it's 5:00 in the morning. you hop in the shower, dry off, and sit down on the bed in your hotel room. you open up the uber app and order wendy's. you look out your hotel room window and there's a wendy's 20 yd away but you're too tired to walk over and they don't unlock their dine-in doors for 2 hours. 

you place an order for wendy's on your uber app and then you kick back and relax. waiting for the driver to show up.

you receive a text from the driver when their car shows on the map that they are at your hotel. but it's been a half hour since your shower. you're exhausted. 

now imagine you're the driver for uber. you receive an offer to take a delivery for 9 mi for $12. not too bad. so yeah, grab the wendy's, hop on the expressway, avoid the toll roads that would add $10 to your delivery cost, and arrive at the hotel. 

and then you text the customer, get no reply, you wait 4 minutes and try again with no reply. you phone the customer and it goes straight to voicemail. and it's a secure hotel with the closed reception desk and no unlocked door.

so far the 6 or 7 orders that have popped up for me were all so outrageously low, i rejected them all.  but i mean they are so low, i don't understand how they could possibly include mileage and a tip.  here i'll show some examples, yall tell me what you think.   
  
**just me or are these ridiculously low, and is it possible they are just the mileage (not actually including the tip)?** 

note the last one, insanely far away, the $ amount is less than 50 cents a mile (again supposedly including the tip) and does that (2) mean the customer had orders from 2 different restaurants?

account under review so i set up an uber driver account 2 years ago but recently just started uber delivery these last couple months. i’m not allowed to do instant payouts right now because my account is under review but i’m still able to go online and do deliveries.i’m not sure what’s going on. i can wait until the direct deposit because i don’t need the money right this second but i’m worried i might get deactivated. i only have 2 thumbs down for a drink that spilled while it was in the sealed bag and one because i was late but that was due to traffic. the rest of my reviews are thumbs up. btw customer support was no help at all.,2024-10-30 12:57:32,0,1,Reddit,UberEats

"walgreens pickup - f'ing disaster i tried to pick up a package from walgreens today...first time i was directed to that store. i followed the instructions in the app and pulled in through the pharmacy drive through. there were two cars before me, so i wait maybe 3-5 minutes. pull up to the drive through and see the pharmacy workers doing pharmacy work, and not giving me a single glance. i wait another couple of minutes. i see cars backing up behind me. i wonder if i'm supposed to notify the employees, seeing as they're still not looking at me. i push the button to notify them, and they tell me they'll be with me in a moment. i wait for another 7 minutes, while the pharmacy folk continuing to ignore me. 

i'm queued up to pick up another delivery, so i'm getting very annoyed. i give up my place in the queue and i go inside. the front checkout (nearly empty) confirms the pharmacy is where uber deliveries should be picked up, so i walk back. at least 4 more people are waiting inline for the pharmacy inside the store. 

looking back now, i probably should have seen if they would at least hand me the uber package, but at the time i felt so frustrated. i canceled the pickup, hoping that i could still get my next order. which i couldn't. the walgreens pickup took so long that someone else grabbed my next order, so i arrived to find nothing.

i don't blame the pharmacy workers, tbh. they were clearly overwhelmed. but i am wondering who the hell at walgreens decided that having pickups at the pharmacy was a good idea? 

i'm really pissed off that i missed my order queued up after walgreens...is there anyone who knows if i can make a complaint in the ubereats app for how walgreens directed uber drivers? i'm not hopeful that i'll get compensation for a missed delivery...but i'd like to encourage walgreens to make a better pickup direction for future drivers. what do other drivers think? am i on the wrong track here?",2024-10-29 21:22:11,0,21,Reddit,UberEats

"uber eats locked my gift card balance, blocked promotions, and refused to cancel my order today, i tried to place an uber eats order using a promotion i received, only to encounter this error:

>""promotion codes are not available for this account and all trips will be charged at the full price.""

after the promo failed, i tried placing the order again without it, but then received another error:

>""we've detected a problem. there was an error processing your request. please visit in-app help for assistance.""

i attempted several troubleshooting steps, including trying a different device, adding a new credit card, and removing/re-adding existing payment methods. nothing worked; the same error kept appearing.

notably, i have an $25 gift card balance applied by default at checkout. when i disabled this gift card balance, the order finally went through, revealing that uber was effectively blocking my use of the $25 balance.

after the order was placed, i immediately tried to cancel it. however, when i tapped ""help"" and then ""cancel,"" an error appeared. upon retrying, the ""cancel"" option had vanished altogether. i contacted uber's support via chat, but they informed me they couldn't cancel the order either, as it was an ""automated"" process and outside their control.

in short:

* uber effectively froze my $25 gift card balance, preventing me from using it.
* uber refused to cancel an order that i attempted to cancel within seconds of placement, with no option for user or support intervention.",2024-10-29 19:07:14,3,3,Reddit,UberEats

yesterday, my wife and i were exhausted after a long weekend out of state with the in-laws, so when we got home, we ordered two burgers and two fries from shake shake via ubereats at 6:09pm. the estimated delivery time was 6:35 with ""latest arrival"" at 7:00. the order kept getting delayed and ultimately arrived at 7:20pm - 40 minutes after she picked up the food (we live 9 minutes from the restaurant). the driver appeared to be running personal errands en route as they stopped for nearly 10 minutes at a store parking lot on the way (i know uber can track this, but i took timestamped screen shots of the driver stopped in the same spot).

but the worst par was when i opened my burger to put it on the plate, a cockroach fell off of it and onto the carton. naturally, we threw all of the food out (in the trash cans outside). i submitted a help request to ubereats within minutes of receiving the order (the order arrived at 7:20, the image is time stamped 7:21). their response was to refund me for the price of one burger. their reasoning was that ""in order to be fair to all eaters, they have to be consistent"" so they cannot refund the entire order. after several more exchanges, they held firm in that stance.

i knew their customer service was bad. but this is next level bad. i would have expected a partial refund if i was writing only about the fact that the food arrived 20+ minutes after the ""latest arrival"" time. that would be reasonable. but the fact that they are only willing to refund the single item means that they believe their customers should eat food that's been sitting in a bag with at least one cockroach for, presumably, the entire 40+ minutes it too for the food to get bagged at the restaurant, picked up, and then dropped off at our house.

either that, or they assume anyone requesting food safety help is a liar. putting foreign objects on food to get free meals is well known and longstanding tactic, so i wouldn't blame them for being skeptical about any ""there was xxxx in my food!"" complaints. they probably get a ton of them. but even then, take it on a case by case basis. we've been uber customers for more than a decade, and have placed dozens of uber eats orders without major issues like this. there are far easier things to place on food than a live cockroach if the aim was to scam ubereats into giving us a free meal.

at this point, i'm less bothered about the $25 or so i'm eating (or not eating, technically) on the order than i am about the straight up dismissal by uber's ""support"" team. if i was at the physical restaurant and showed them a cockroach on my burger less than 2 minutes after receiving it, they'd promptly refund me and/or offer to replace the order. it's disgusting, but also pretty straightforward problem/solution. and if a health inspector found a cockroach in the restaurant's food prep area, they'd be fined and shut down until they could demonstrate that the problem had been resolved. but according to ubereats, customers should just eat everything else in the bag they didn't actually witness the bug walking on.

if anyone has advice on escalating complaints with uber, let me know. i tried facebook messenger and x dms with no luck.

"acceptance rate i am a new driver, started 2 weeks ago. 

yesterday, i accepted a delivery in an area i generally avoid due to bad traffic. while in the area, i received the same similar requests minimum 15 times: 
pickup 3 packages at walmart, 
price offer: 8-9$ total (incl tips), 
expected tune: between 55 min to 70 min, 
drop off: 3 unrelated deliveries at different addresses 
for about 12 miles (i suspect acrual would have been a bit more with the 3 stops). 

granted, each 15 offers might have had slight variances with one of the factor: stops, price, order of stops, or mileage. overall, it never was a credible offer.

my acceptance rate was pretty stable at 45% since i started. yesterday, because of this laughable offer, received repeatedly with minimal updates, if any, it went down to 18-20%. 

i did receive a notification that my acceptance rate was lower than others. i am not worry about it because this offer was an ask to volunteer. but i'm little annoy to receive notification that:
a) i could not respond to, 
b) i could not challenge its accuracy,
c) was initiated by ubereats

i looked through the help resources, didn't find nothing to this scenario. i contacted the support by chat, wrote my question to the bot, rewrote it for the agent who needed to put me on hold for 3min to look into this. i received a follow up 9min later: a cut and paste of the acceptance rate calculation from the help resources. my question was clearly worded around one request being counted as decline every time a dime was added/removed, stop order changing, or adding/removing 0.1 mile, etc. 

i don't mind receiving the same  requests multiple times, preferably if there is a noticeable effort to make it more appealing. but really? to keep receiving the same similar order 15 times, and then receiving a comment on my acceptance rate was a bit setting me up for failure...

"is the ubereats app illegal in canada by not displaying invoice before ordering? i hadn't used the app in a while. i ordered some food and i kept waiting for the ""total"" screen with all the items and subtotal and taxes and delivery fee, etc., but it never came! the order was just placed. there was what appeared to be some kind of timed ""is everything right with this, ok if you don't do anything it will be assumed yes, ok you didn't do anything so everything must be cool with your bill"" bullshit that rolled around on the screen for a few seconds before it started the normal countdown to your delivery. what a slimy slimy shady shady practice. even after when i tried to figure out how much the bill was i found it very confusing. i am a cpa, the issue is not me. so, opinions anyone? this feels illegal to me. they pump an order through without showing you the invoice first?

"overheard mcdonald's employee say they get charged if the driver waits too long does anyone know if this is true?

i was waiting for a pickup at mcdonald's when i heard a manager tell her employee to bag my order asap because uber charges them per minute i stand there and wait. 

my grinch heart wants to believe this is true for every time i waited on lazy employees, but i dare not hope. i really suspect she was just wrong about how uber bills mcdonald's, but i would be interested in any inside info.

i looked at signing up for uber as a merchant and the plans seem to be sold to them as a percentage of the food cost, no mention of penalizing them for making a driver wait. 


edit: for people who stumble across this post. it's confirmed! other restaurants have stated this to me as well, they get charged more if we wait. both uber and dd are doing this. 

i will say, the dunkin that told me uber charges them for our wait also said they get drivers right when the orders come in as well, so it may just be a ploy to charge restaurants more, but won't actually reduce our wait times. boo.",2024-10-28 06:27:14,18,66,Reddit,UberEats

i was looking at the opportunities tab today and saw several orders available for walmart delivery that were 9 deliveries?? how the hell would a car have 9 compartments? i asked a different walmart's employee later if this policy was real, and he said yes. so do i just need to decline walmart orders from now on to be safe from screwing over my cancellation rate?",2024-10-27 15:14:58,3,33,Reddit,UberEats

"food stolen? too bad. according to ue support. currently in customer ""support"" hell because our driver who was delivering our food decided to just take a photo of his hand covering the camera and drove off with our $50 worth of chinese food. we were told our order isn't eligible for a refund or price adjustment.

my pregnant wife was really craving chinese food and we both got off work late. mentally drained, exhausted and hungry, we decided to order from a place called hunan restaurant. the driver drove up to our place, parked for a second in our driveway and then drove off. i called this guy 6 times to see wtf was going on. no answer. he just blocked me. when my wife realized we had our food stolen, she began to cry. she was very hungry, emotional, and all she was looking forward to last night was that chinese food, and we had the unfortunate luck of ending up with an awful driver.

there is a silver lining. i called the restaurant and explained our terrible situation and thankfully, the restaurant said they would remake our food at no additional charge to us. when i drove over to the restaurant, the waiter there said he called uber eats and they explained to him that we would be getting our refund. 

now i'm going through their customer support, and they  just regurgitate the same information over and over again. ""we can confirm this order isn't eligible for a refund or price adjustment. thank you for your understanding."" we ""technically"" got the food we paid for. but i really wished it didn't come at the expense of my wife's emotions and having to drive to the place we wanted food delivered from.

tl:dr
i just want that driver to be removed so he doesn't steal food from someone else. but it seriously looks like nothing is going to happen to him.

"brain-dread uber eats support agents are gonna get my account deactivated  at least for shop and pay orders. the payment system with the plus card is garbage. 90% of the time it works, but then it just randomly won’t process the payment and i have to use my own funds and request a reimbursement. i know a lot of times it’s because the amount charged is higher than what the estimate is on the app, but sometimes the estimates are just way off especially for some restaurant order-and-pays. some restaurants will raise their menu prices and uber does not update it on their side. 

anyways, i had a massive shopping order over 250 dollars the other day and i couldn’t fit the entire picture with all the items listed without zooming the phone camera back making the writing hard to see. i submitted it partially showing most the items and the subtotal as the app only lets you submit a single photo. i immediately spoke with a support agent to request a reimbursement as i had to pay with my own money. i then gave him pictures of the receipt in two parts showing all the items and subtotal. he assured me everything would be reimbursed and processed correctly blah blah blah. over 48 hours later and a few frustrating phone calls and chats with support i finally received my reimbursement. they emailed me saying i would be banned from doing shop and pays if i don’t begin submitting correct itemized receipts. i emailed back explaining the situation and how i had actually submitted the receipt pictures correctly to other support agents. no response. oh well, at least i got my money back. 

just yesterday i do an order and pay at a restaurant. again the payment did not go through. the estimate was for around 46 dollars but the subtotal was for around 53. i pay out of my pocket for it. the problem is the restaurant does not provide paper itemized receipts and only texted me a copy of the full receipt. on this order, the uber eats app prompts me for a picture of the receipt but does not allow me to grab pictures from my phone library, so i just submit a picture of a paper with the restaurants name and a few order details. i right away knew this was gonna be a problem. before delivering the order i speak with a support agent where i was able to send the actual receipt. i also requested the reimbursement. i explained the situation and asked him to make sure to correct my original submission.  he assured me everything will be a o.k. replying with the typical copy and paste prompts of “we are sorry for the inconvenience” “rest assured” blah blah blah. 

this morning i get an email saying they will only reimburse me the 46 dollars estimate amount as i did not submit an itemized receipt and that i am at risk of being banned from doing shop and pays. if i believe this is an error to please respond to this email with the correct receipt. i received the email through the uber app, but here’s the thing, the agent that sent me that closed the email discussion so now i can’t even respond to that. 

i’ve now been chatting with support agents to get my full reimbursement and to make sure they don’t demote my account. they unfortunately now have no idea what to do. they go “it seems as though your reimbursement has already been processed” 

what a pain in the ass. here i am paying out of my own pocket, having my funds held from me for days, risking not getting paid back in full, wasting time with countless support agents, and finally getting threatened to get demoted from shop and pays all because their entire payment system and support agents are ridiculous and incompetent. 

even though most reimbursement requests do go smoothly, i still have many other examples of when it didn’t. it’s such a hassle! sorry for the long read.

when the delivery driver arrived, she called and told me to come downstairs, even though it’s part of their job to deliver to my door. she said, “you should come out, considering it’s out of our area,” which wasn’t true, but fine—i went outside to meet her. to my surprise, she was a large woman who immediately had an attitude. she told me i owed $5 and asked if i had cash. i said no and asked her to charge my card. she went back to her car, got her phone, and called the store.

then, she started arguing with the guy at the store about what to do while i stood there for 20 minutes. eventually, the guy on the phone said, “just give her the food; she already paid and only owes the delivery fee.” she handed me the food, yelled, “i drove over here for nothing, and i didn’t get a tip!”

"so... i figured it out this whole ar thing is all just a bunch of bs. it's not going to change the types of orders you get at all.

if you are in a shitty market, your market will still be shitty. if you are in a good market, your market will still be good.

what they are really trying to do is get rid of the rewards, just like they got rid of compensation for picked up orders and punish you for everything else.

the only people who it will effect are people who use these rewards, like the school thing.

if you don't use any rewards or care about them at all... like me... nothing is going to change one bit

it's just manipulating tactics that they use. it's the same on dd.

say its a $15 order for 3 miles..... if you have a good ar - they will unhide more of the tip so it might come to you as $10 for 3 miles.... if you have a low ar - the same order will come to you as $6 or $7.. but in the end will be the same order",2024-10-25 14:26:13,10,10,Reddit,UberEats

after the order was completed, the total didn't have the coupon applied so i opened a chat with them hoping to resolve the issue but of course, without screenshot they won't do anything. instead they just close the chat without even letting you explain the situation. this is the second time it happens to me. the first time i had a screenshot fortunately. i forgot to take one this time, but that's beside the point. i shouldn't even have to screenshot it. they definitely have a way to check if you had a coupon at the time the order was placed.

at this point, i don't even care about resolving the issue. instead, i want to focus on exposing this behavior. this is so blatant and deserves more attention than it's currently getting. if you guys have any idea how to make this reach /r/all, i'm all up for it.

"cancellation fees on alcohol delivery vs food the other day i placed an alcohol delivery order for a few cases of beer and seltzers for ~$400 and then cancelled immediately after placing the order.

i ended up getting charged the full 400ish fee which was surprising since alcohol doesn’t require any preparation and no driver was assigned to the order since it was ~30 seconds between the order and cancellation.

i talked to uber customer support who said that because “the order was in preparation it cannot be stopped” which i thought applied to food but not alcohol since it’s in a case (i.e., not perishable). i contacted the store who also said they didn’t receive any money for the transaction (which means uber kept it all) and therefore couldn’t help with a refund or fulfilling the order anyway.

if i knew this would happen, i would’ve at least taken the alcohol but now am ~$400 in the hole. is there any recourse to get some form of a refund or replacement order? seems like a hefty fine for a situation where the store or uber didn’t lose anything. even a small cancellation fee would’ve been fine but this is a brutal policy especially since i use uber eats for corporate purposes quite often.

often people will just leave the food on the ground outside the porch door. 

i don't know what the best way to fix this is. 
i have a clear photo of where to sit the food in the app.  good lighting if it's dark. clear instructions. 

all i can think of is leaving negative feedback. but 1. i don't want to cost someone their job over something that deeply annoys me but is ultimately frivolous. 
2. i assume leaving negative feedback for one person doesn't get sent along to whoever the next driver is. 

also is there a reason for why people may be doing this that i'm missing? 
the patio is mesh so you can see inside. it also has numbers on the clear door so they can be certain they are at the correct address. i also leave the light behind the front door on to make it clear they are expected.

"ubereats won’t remove a disputed charge after i won—now they’re demanding payment and refusing to close my account
 i won a dispute against ubereats through amex after they failed to deliver my order properly. it was dumplings from a very expensive restaurant and by the time the driver delivered them (60 minutes past the time he arrived to deliver them), they were inedible.

the driver was an ah and even though he was in my complex, refused to deliver my order, stopped communicating to me for 7-10 minute intervals, wouldn’t come to the drop off spot, refused to tell me where they were and told me they were “thinking about if they were going to deliver my order or not”!!! 

despite being on the phone with support as well as thru the app, during 40 minutes of this debacle, ubereats refused to even refund my $1.99 priority fee. i spent a couple of weeks arguing with them (they were truly ahs), i finally just filed a dispute with amex, who sided with me, in may 2023 and fully refunded me.

flash forward, it’s now 17 months later and ubereats still refuses to accept the dispute results and continues to demand payment.

this is their response to me:

""however, it appears a chargeback initiated with american express has put your account into arrears. our team’s investigation of this charge leads us to believe it was legitimate and will need to be settled before you can request again. you’ll either need to contact american express to cancel the chargeback, or let us know which payment method on your account you’d like to charge the arrears to.""

i just want to close my uber account and revoke any permissions they have, but i am in an endless loop that i cannot seem to get them to move past. have tried using x, spoke to amex again, etc. i know legally they can’t charge me after losing the dispute (confirmed by amex), and that they themselves lost the dispute with amex, but they don’t seem to care what’s legal. has anyone else dealt with anything like this? any suggestions to get this resolved? i told them to send my account to collections if they want to, but to close it out. and still, they refused.

edit to add:   
uber has violated the **fair credit billing act (fcba).**   
the merchants' terms of service do not and cannot supersede federal law or the binding resolution of the credit card chargeback process. the fcba protects consumers from continued collection attempts after a charge has been lawfully disputed and resolved.

their correspondence with me actually violates the fcba, in every possible way, including continuing to request payment. it turns out that if a merchant disagrees with the dispute, legally, they can appeal it but they have to have new/additional evidence, to prove why they're appealing. all of my evidence was screenshots of our entire chat, which included my initial request to uber to just refund my $1.99 priority fee, which i felt was a reasonable ask under the circumstances. uber denied me. amex made the decision to give me back the entire order amount (less the $15 fee that amex paid as a part of my rewards). 

i filed a complaint with the **california ag**, the  **federal trade commission (ftc)** and **consumer financial protection bureau (cfpb**). i will update when i get responses and let everyone know if i have any success.

"grocery order from uber eats is the biggest scam i've been an avid uber eats user for years, but lately, my experience has been nothing short of a nightmare. it's become a regular occurrence for me to open my app and see an unexpected ""adjustment"" added to my order, sometimes as much as $20!

there's no clear explanation for these charges. one time, it was labeled as a ""delivery fee adjustment,"" but the initial delivery fee was already included in the original order. another time, it was simply listed as an ""adjustment"" with no further details. it's incredibly frustrating and feels like i'm being taken advantage of.

"food got stolen today from one of uber driver caught on camera i've been using u/uber for years, and this is the first time my food got stolen by a driver. they dropped off the order, took a photo to confirm, but then left with the food. unbelievable. i reported it to uber support, and they said they'd investigate and follow up with me. hopefully, they take action and deactivate the driver/thief responsible for this.

**update**: i gave her the benefit of the doubt, calling her three times through the uber app, but she didn’t answer. that’s what truly frustrated me. i wanted to give her a chance to correct the situation, but she chose not to. i usually tip 24% or more, especially when the order is small or the drive is longer. in this case, the trip was only 1.3 miles, my food cost $31, and i tipped her $8.03, which i believe was fair and generous for the distance and time. it's disappointing when you try to be fair and reasonable, yet people fail to act with integrity. i also contacted uber, and while they refunded my order and gave a credit, i made it clear this wasn’t about the credit. it’s about doing what’s right and upholding good values.

have a neighbor that was telling me than ue driver accidentally dropped off an order at their house, which they never ordered. the food was left on their porch and doorbell rung. when the neighbor went to open the door, they saw the food.  brought the food inside and didn’t think much of it as maybe someone else in the house had placed an order. opened the bag and took some fries. again, thinking someone in the family placed an order.

then they got a work call exactly as the doorbell rang again. neighbor said they didn’t think much  of the doorbell because they were waiting for a delivery and thought it the delivery driver just giving a heads up the package had been delivered. after the phone call, neighbor opens the door and doesnt see the package. checks the doorbell camera and see the ue came back to pick up the food ?

"i’m curious about how drivers see/accept tips. i have an experience from today, with an incredible driver. i don’t post on reddit very often, so i hope i’m going about this correctly.

i’m wondering if a tip is increased later, does the driver see where it came from? actually so many questions about tips. hopefully drivers are receiving the full amount. and do you see the tip before accepting the order? i’m a good tipper (i work in the service industry) but i added extra to my tip for today because of what happened at when the driver showed up. i always watch the car on the vehicle tracking act. i don’t care
so much when it’s take out, but this was alcohol, so i had to meet the driver with my id. so i’m watching my phone. apparently the driver was still 3 mins away. and i get a phone call from an unknown number, and my phone tells me it’s “likely spam”, so i don’t answer. then a minute later the driver is at my door. now here is where i feel horrible, and want to increase the tip. my friend and her dog were over. we were inside, and i was waiting to meet the driver outside (hence watching the app) but we hadn’t heard him enter the yard, and my screen door wasn’t
properly latched, so dorian (the dog) saw someone outside and was able to open the unlatched door. dorian is not an aggressive dog at all, but he is big and ten months, so crazy energy. 
the driver was amazing and understandable, said there was probably some glitch in the app that didn’t show his arrival.  anyways i just feel horrible that he had to deal with the dog craziness, so i tipped extra afterwards. i guess i’d just like to know if you add more tip later, does the driver see the order it’s coming from? i’d like him to know it’s my way of saying i’m sorry he had to deal with that. i apologized to him lots in person, but an extra tip helps!

the only answer is for local, state, and federal law to recognize the problem as a workers rights problem and force fair wages. the system should not rely on tipping. customers should have fair after-expense minimum wages built in to their costs. just like in so many countries where food costs are high at restaurants, waiters are well compensated, and tipping doesn't even occur. we need to focus more on the role of government in enabling the situation - it's the only mechanism that can force change.",2024-10-21 18:14:31,0,75,Reddit,UberEats

i ordered from a local pizza place tonight for delivery, about $30 with tax before tip. no promos used but i did use an uber gift card balance. 

the driver called me after about 10 minutes asking me where i was, i stated on my porch thinking they had just gone down the wrong street, pretty common mistake. she said well where's that? the uber app is telling me to deliver the food to the restaurant i picked it up from!"" she then handed the phone to the store worker, who was kind after i told her to have the driver call uber, i can't do anything about it but i'll call too. so we both hung up and called, ubereats chat support was extremely unhelpful and disconnected after i said four times ""it is not about the delay, the driver is unable to deliver the item entirely.  yes the item was picked up, can you change the address or not?"" apparently they cannot as sapna (actual handle)  ended the chat. 
i called the eats support number and she confirmed there was some kind of glitch on the driver's app side, as she and i both saw the correct delivery address.  i asked the phone worker to communicate that to the driver and tell them they will be compensated, she said she couldn't reach the driver and to call back if the food quality was bad if it arrived since it was picked up. i asked totally exasperated, if they cared at all about this poor driver going in circles for an hour due to their issue, or about the customer experience, or does uber only care about cold food?  she said yes, call us if your order is bad. until then i can't help you.  so i hung up.  driver arrived about 2 minutes after i hung up, 48 minutes after picking up the food. it was obvious the driver is a senior trying to make ends meet, she couldnt understand how to input the pin so i assisted.  she couldn't stop apologizing and told me the man she spoke to ""forced the order through"" which is how she was able to deliver it.  i could see in her face she expected this one to be a total loss, she seemed defeated. 
so i increased the tip to match the order cost.   it soothes my guilt and hopefully will make her night just a little better.  but i do want some kind of apology from ubereats, my options seem to be to claim the food is cold/ damaged or just deal with it.  ubereats admitted this was their system, so i don't want to dispute the food as cold and have the money taken from the restaurant, nor driver.  will they be punished if i report the actually cold food?  

tldr: ubereats driver app glitched showed the pick up location restaurant as the drop off. senior driver not terribly tech savvy spent 45 minutes to get my order to me. ubereats admitted it was their glitch to me over the phone, said they could not give a promo or anything for the issues unless i report damaged or cold food. it is cold but clearly due to ubereats. if i call and report it as such, will the restaurant still get paid or will ubereats blame them if they give me a credit or discount? if that's the case, i'll never use ubereats again.  so i appreciate anyone with insider knowledge.

"just finished my 100th delivery after my first 2 weeks delivering. some initial thoughts:  some of this might be common knowledge here, but this is my first time to this sub. 

1. the app is buggy at times and has a lot of weird little quirks, some of which make driving and navigating the app outright dangerous. i am on android, and if the uber eats app is closed out or my phone screen turned off for any reason and a trip request pops up, it does not allow me to see the trip in detail so i have to blindly select if i want to take a trip without knowing anything about the path. also the user interface is just non intuitive in many ways, and seems to really prioritize not being able to access any information except for exactly when the app thinks you will need it (trying to find someone's address when you haven't picked the food up yet etc. you cant do that?)

2. something thats happening a few times is someone will order fast food late night and in their order will be some dessert thing which the store is out of. on my end it does not allow me to call the customer until after i've picked up my orders, i can only text them for whatever reason. so now i have this situation where i need to decide if i cancel the whole order, or else i'll text them if they want a substitution, but of course they are never quickly responding to the text and now i'm holding up the drive thru? i don't know what to do in this spot, and i don't know what options the customer has to make things right with uber on their end if i do just bring the incomplete order.

3. delivering to apartment complexes sucks

4. people that order yet somehow seem to not be aware that their order is coming, or that they should be somewhat ready to answer the door, absolutely suck. (if they have ""meet at door"" or pin on)

5. mcdonald's method of putting drinks inside the paper food bag is crazy to me. you can't tell what's going on in there, or if everything is okay. sometimes i can't be sure that a paper bag is perfectly upright throughout a trip. i'm convinced my only thing down so far is because of a spilled drink in a mcdonald's order.",2024-10-20 20:56:51,1,14,Reddit,UberEats

"did an experiment, definitely learned! i have only been driving for ue a few weeks, but i haven't ordered from the app itself in years. today i wanted to see what the customer experience is like. i ordered one meal (no drink) from a place around 6.5 miles away. spent about $20 or so. accidentally tapped the button for a free uber one trial, if that matters at all. 🤦 i tipped $10 up front (i know this probably sounds like a bad one for the mileage, but it is actually pretty good compared to the tips i see in my area; plus, i thought better of it and added another $3 after delivery).

the order was accepted pretty quickly, i think. my driver did end up completing two orders, so i'm guessing that mine got stacked with a no tip offer. i was not able to see where the driver was until she got to my restaurant, but the app did tell me that she was completing another order. delivery was good, instructions followed, and she left a nice message after leaving it on my porch.

i did see that while ordering, the default tip options are not dollar amounts like doordash has. they're percentages, and weird ones, like 18% and 23%. so, people who generally don't like to tip more than 20% would probably pick the 18% option instead of the 23%, although they might have chosen 20% flat if that option had been available. strike one for uber deliberately structuring things to screw drivers. there is a custom amount option, but it does take slightly more effort and is a dollar amount instead of a percentage, so i can kind of see how customers would just take the easy route.

i did have a special request for the restaurant, but there was nowhere to put that in my order screen. i knew the driver likely wouldn't see delivery notes until she had already left the restaurant, and i didn't want to bother her by messaging. i called the restaurant and made the request that way, and it was correct when i got the food.

anyway, i wish i could talk to my driver, i just have a couple of questions. did she accept another order while working on mine, or was she already on one when mine came up, and if so why? did she feel my offer wasn't good? or was it already stacked with a bad offer? no shade either way, i understand the game, just curious. also, i'd really like to know if she received the full $13 tip that i sent, and what the base fare was for my order. (or if she even could tell that if the order was stacked.) if it was stacked, did it seem likely that mine or the other was the better offer? does she remember the order in which she was instructed to pick up and drop off? does she remember the original offer amount from ue?

it didn't occur to me until later that i could have placed the order and then gone online and accepted it myself, so i will probably try that at another time.

this is a long shot, but if you're on this forum, i'd love to dm with you. driver name started with a, and you delivered an order from metro diner in okc with a drop off time of around 1:30 pm central time. if you're comfortable, i'd really appreciate a dm to talk about those questions.

"what is it with people tipping before they have their food? i've seen so many posts where people get comments from their driver about their tip. what i don't understand is why you would pay a tip before you even have your food?

the sales price is for the making of the food, the delivery fee is for getting my food to me but the tip is for getting my whole order to me while it's hot and in a reasonable time. it's a performance reward and is based on how well they did with that last part. untill i have my food, i don't know how well you did.

if people only tip after they get their food, uber can get rid of this insane option of cancelling a tip someone already gave.",2024-10-20 10:13:42,0,59,Reddit,UberEats

i send them a phone number that i use to contact support. no luck, the number is only for drivers or restaurants. i look on the internet, find some number, send it to the customer and bingo! they have a human and all is sorted out for them. order cancelled, i go home.

today, i have deliveries and what do you know! the same customer orders from another place. i saw the name, thought about the one from yesterday, but what are the odds, right? it turned out it was them! and i got a nice note and it really warmed my heart!

let's be good and kind to each other. ubereats sucks and treats us like crap, but we can make everything so much better for each other and treat each other with kindness and respect!

"automated system mistakenly cancelled my order - do i dispute with bank? hi everyone and appreciate any assistance here.
i put in an uber eats order for a potluck for a panda express tray. the estimated time was 25 minutes at first.

it then suddenly switched to 2 hours… which would be too late. so i looked into canceling the order. it said it would charge me $75. the automated system asked me if i’d like to cancel my order and i said “no don’t cancel” and it still cancelled anyways, and charged me $75. so now i’m down 75 dollars and nothing to bring to this potluck.

i disputed this with three reps and said nothing they could do. i called panda and they said they never received the order to begin with - so it just seems like a scam for uber to take my money while putting on a facade that they care about the restaurant’s time.

i am fully planning to dispute this with my credit card but would that ban me from uber rides forever? that might be inconvenient.

"why are ice cream orders not priority for stacked orders? not really a genuine question since technically the answer (money) to this question is obvious but this stuff really butters my biscuit. is it unreasonable to give ice cream orders some type of priority delivery status so the order doesn’t melt before arriving to the customer. there’s many different ways they could go about this quality control problem but i feel like this would be a reliable solution that wouldn’t negatively affect the drivers or customers. 

i’ve heard of people complaining about the importance of an insulated delivery bag for orders like these but the idea that requiring every driver to have one seems expensive and since uber obviously wouldn’t be the one to provide one, it would just make it more difficult for certain drivers. 

i’m sort of just ranting at this point since my ice cream arrived melted after my driver had to make a delivery before mine lol. 

i would like to see who else thinks this concept of delivering ice cream last in a stacked order is silly. it really does seem like uber has no idea what their customers and employees need/want when you realize issues like this exist tbh.

"order never delivered. ubereats not refunding!!! gonna copy paste down here what i wrote to uber.

""i ordered from panda house at 4:37am on october 17th, 2024. the restaurant was using their own delivery partner, so i added a $12 tip. the order was supposed to be delivered latest by 5:10am. however, the order was never delivered.

in the course of waiting for more than 90 minutes for the order, i contacted uber eats 5 times and the restaurant 12 times. the restaurant, however, never answered - neither mine nor the calls made by uber eats executives to the restaurant. it kept going to voice mails and i left them messages. after waiting for more than 90 minutes, when i called ubereats, the last two executives informed me that they have put in the request in the system for cancellation of order on their end so that the merchant can directly do it. they repeatedly told me they will get the order canceled and i should not do it or else i will be charged the cancellation fee. they also put in the record of this in the system and made a note of it, as i was told. 

however, today morning i saw that my order was shown as completed at 9am. this was absolutely absurd as i never got the order and i had placed the order at 4:37am. in addition to that, i was told it would be canceled on their end. i was given inconsistent information on several ends. the app kept showing the order was in progress for several hours. 

this is absolutely unprofessional behaviour on the part of the restaurant but also uber eats who initially refused to help me, later provided some help but ultimately showed the order was completed without me ever receiving it. this has caused me significant distress as i had ordered food before leaving for work but the food never came and i had go through the stress of calling uber eats and restaurant for more than an hour. uber eats takes no accountability for several lines of miscommunication on their end. 

i really expect a refund for the order i never received - which was in all actuality also assured by uber eats in my last two calls (please listen to the call recordings and also the note made by ubereats upon my calls).""

""we appreciate you for bringing this concern to us.

i’m carl, one of the supervisors from the uber support team.

i understand how you may feel about this inconvenience, and i took the time to investigate this further thoroughly.

however, your payment for this order isn’t eligible for an adjustment due to the high number of similar adjustments made to your account in the past.

in case you experienced any issues with your delivery, we kindly encourage you to provide your valuable feedback by rating and leaving comments for your delivery person or the merchant through the app. your feedback is crucial in helping us collaborate with merchants and delivery persons to improve the overall order experience.

we have processes in place to review this type of feedback so your concern hasn't gone unnoticed.

"driver + 'second driver' scam? i ordered groceries this evening (roughly £50 total, pre-tipped 10%). aside from being over an hour late (which was reflected on the app -- annoying, but fine), a completely different driver arrived than who was pictured on my app with two grocery bags containing part of the order. he said the third and final bag was with another driver who was just behind him and would be coming shortly. i didn't feel safe enough to question or challenge given this was not the person on my app, it was late at night, and i've never had this happen before.

the 'second driver' never appeared. i got refunded the missing items after reporting them missing, no questions asked (via the uber app). aside from being incredibly inconvenient (we have no dinner tonight now), i'm a bit wigged out/confused.

"how to deal with scamming customers using “meet at door” i have an effective solution for customers who are suspicious or may attempt to scam by claiming deliveries weren't delivered to their address.

these customers often mark their delivery as ""meet at door"" and request to have the package left there at their door. this creates a situation where you have no proof of delivery since photo verification isn’t available until after the timer expires. who is going to wait seven minutes in scorching heat / or in a storm / bad weather. 

to address this, i've started using a timestamp camera app. i’ll take a photo of the package at the delivery location, copy the coordinates from the app and send them to the customer. i inform the customer that the photos have been taken and will be forwarded to support as proof of delivery, given their request to leave the package at the door. this most likely scares them and makes them think twice before reporting a delivery as not delivered. 

i understand some customers will have their notes set by default and forget to change them. what’s wrong is some of these customers may be scamming. 

one store told me about a guy who frequently marked his deliveries as missing items or undelivered, making him a real headache for them. they had to contact support multiple times to receive payment after he was refunded.

since we’re in a small city (dunedin, new zealand), i encountered this customer often. he would set his delivery to ""meet at door"" and then ask me to call when i arrived, only to tell me to leave the package at the door. i called him and warned him to stop reporting missing items emphasising that it jeopardised people’s jobs. i also mentioned i would report him to support. now i never see him on uber, but i still get deliveries to him on doordash — it's quite the laugh!

"30+ min hot food deliveries... idk why it's becoming more common to have a delivery that takes a minimum of 25-30 min from the restaurant to the drop off location, but this morning was just... wrong.

6 times in a row, i was offered to pick up nico's pizza at 4:15-4:30am. it was exactly the same offer, each time increasing in price. the first offer was $4.19. then $4.90. followed by $6.23. i finally accepted it at $10.50 after so many declines...

turns out, the customer ordered an xxl thin crust with 10+ toppings... receipt total was $43.50 for a single pizza... wtf?!?

anyway, i went into the pizza shop with my 16"" pizza bag, only to find a 24"" box - literally two feet square!

after sliding it into my back seat, i looked at the map to discover what was offered as a 10 min, 6 mile drive for $10.50 was now a 15 mile 39 min drive.

i delivered it. it was a ""meet at door"" guest who wasn't home or had gone to bed after ordering. i waited the 8 min until the arrival timer counted down, knocking and phoning, texting and knocking again... no answer. left the pizza in the 40 degree cold on their patio table.

lately, i've had ihop, dennys/meltdown/burgerden, panda, and pizza hut deliveries that - even in the best of situations with zero traffic and hitting every green light - would take a minimum of 20 min. during rush hour or school days? 30-40 min. add train delays: 60 min...

i know i should never have taken that pizza order. but i wanted to start my day off with $10.

sadly, they reduced the tip to $1 because i left it out in the cold. not my fault... ffs

the point here:

ubereats needs to stop offering hot food pickups for any distance that exceeds 10 min drive time.

i developed multiple sclerosis many years ago, and it's gotten to the point that some days i cannot manage to get around at all, even in my own house. i am in a wheelchair, and days like today, it takes me about 10 minutes to get from my bedside to the living room 15 feet away because my body was so weak and numb, i make it maybe a foot at a time and stop.

  
so, i order food occasionally from uber eats. never had too much of a problem, some forgotten items (fairly often, but i don't blame the drivers, what are they gonna do about it when the bag is sealed), some errors from the restaurant, that kinda stuff.

  
but this one driver, first time i've seen her come up on an order i placed about 2 weeks ago, she left my food 1/2 mile down the road, on the side of the road, because ""there's hella cars out front and it's too dark to be down here without cell service"". i live exactly 1 mile off the main road in a city of about 60,000 people, but it is an old neighborhood with no streetlights so it can be dark down here, and cell service can be spotty starting about 1/4 mile before you get to my house.

  
the things is... there were no cars anywhere other than the ones parked in their normal driveways around at my neighbors, and idk what she was talking about, or what it was that upset her so much. i even asked my neighbors a few doors down if they were having a party or something, since i cannot see every house from my house, but no, everything was quiet. even the neighbors across the street, who usually \*do\* have parties, their house was dark.

  
don't get me wrong, i am not knocking her for wanting to be safe at all, which is why i didn't leave a bad review or anything; i didn't want to contribute to her ever feeling obligated to go into a situation where she felt it was not safe because she was afraid to lose income or something.

  
however, she just picked up my order tonight, and my blood pressure is spiking because i'm not only unable to leave the house today, but i am also sick with something and i'm barely managing to sit up at my desk to work (wfh thank goodness).

"issues with getting refunds? issues with not getting paid? report ubereats to the ftc ubereats is clearly systematically screwing over both drivers and costumers.  it doesn't matter how long you've driven for them, or how long you've been a customer, it doesn't matter how much money you've spent through them they are no longer holding their end of the bargain.

if you've driven from ubereats and not gotten money you're due, report them to the ftc and the department of labor; see: https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/contact/complaints

both customers and drivers should also report to the ftc: https://reportfraud.ftc.gov/

customers; i know many of y'all don't get the items you pay for. i know this because i'm a customer and regularly the drinks are forgotten or other items are forgotten. once you hit a 'refund cap' they flag your account and you're not longer able to get refunds. 

this is straight up fraud and they cannot do this, but they think they can get away with it because, what are you going to do? take them to small claims over a $5 missing drink?

don't let them be in control. we need to be complaining to the authorities.  it's cathartic to complain on here but if we actually want anything to happen we need to start filing official complaints with the ftc (reminder; https://reportfraud.ftc.gov/)

volume matters! if the ftc gets hundreds of complaints (hell even dozens might be enough to flag an investigation) they _will_ investigate. 

you also have your state attorney general's office and state consumer affairs departments to report to as well; but at this point i think the feds need to look into this. 

if you don't live in the us, report it to your country's consumer affairs division.

"uber eats charging me for a cancelled order this is my real experience and i hope people could get a lesson from me. 

today, i ordered a drink from a milk tea cafe and chose to pick up. after \~6 minutes, i received a notification from uber eats saying that ""my order is probably ready"". so i went to the cafe but employee said my order was actually not ready, and told me that the one who is responsible for preparing uber eats order was late and not there! i may need to wait for another 30 minutes. she said i can order again using tablet in their cafe, and she can be working on it. i told her i've ordered on uber eats and couldn't cancel it. but she still said i can. so i canceled order but i don't want to waste more time on this and just left.

later i found that my money was not refunded on uber eats app. it says that the cafe had already accepted order. therefore i cannot get refund for canceling order. i reached out to 3 uber eats customer supports but all of them said ""they cannot do anything for this case"", i tried to ask them if this makes sense to them if they were in my shoes but they just ignored my messages and repeated same words. one of them even just directly ended conversation when i was still typing.

to be honestly, i don't really care an $8 milk tea. but i was shocked by those uber eats customer supports, and i am extremely disappointed with the experience they provided. they just kept saying that it's their system behavior and they couldn't do anything. but their system doesn't have mind, do these customer support also lost common sense? i paid money for nothing and wasted my time on picking up. i know the cafe employee was having problem but i'm also disgusted with uber eats customer supports.

a side note: i tried to ask chatgpt for its opinion about this, and it seems to me that chatgpt is smarter. at least this seems to be an exception from its perspective, and uber eats could issue a refund based on this. this makes me more convinced that these customer service representatives will be replaced by ai in the future eventually. but i guess uber eats better hope they would survive by that time.

beware of such orders i would say after biting the fish hook several times.  if the payment is very high and appears too good to be true, i'd say it probably is.

"profitable way to operate ubereats as a driver i have a hard-set rule that i won’t take 1) orders less than $10 and 2) orders less than $2 per mile. with how shitty uber’s pay is, i got a full-time job, so it doesn’t affect me if i don’t get orders that fit my criteria. i live in a small town and sometimes, like last night, i believe i’m the only driver active.

\*\*this order was offered to me 10 times!\*\* i rejected it 9 times until uber realized i was not one to f with, for lack of better words. uber tried it on the 3^(rd) offer by lowering the rate by over $2! poor customer though who tipped $3.38 for 26 miles round trip order, had to wait 2 hours (i made the delivery at 8:44pm when it was first offered at 6:46pm) for their order while uber slowly, but surely, increased the pay for it to be profitable for me (peep the time at the top left).

if all drivers stuck to their guns and refused orders until it meets their profitable criteria collectively, i’m sure uber would make some change, but sadly there are too many destitute & not-so-bright drivers who would rather pay uber to run these deliveries.

"uber eats scam terrible experience with uber eats.

ordered something from kfc and it remained on preparing for i sh*t you not, 45 minutes. so i decided to cancel and order elsewhere, my d*mbass didn’t realize it stated i will be charged the full amount of the food. 

so i contacted support, they gave me automated replies and in the end couldn’t help and stated no refund could be issued as the restaurant had already been preparing my food, for 45 minutes straight?! come on. 

anyway, in anger i said f the policy, and ended chat, then i ordered from a different restaurant accepting the loss previously. the order states “receiving order” to “preparing order” so i go do my thing, come back 5 minutes later, open the app and boom “order has been cancelled by the uber eats team” 

now i’m pissed so i try to see what’s up and the order is not showing under activity tab, i contact support and went through 3 different agents with mostly automated replies to describe that the order im inquiring about is not even showing up on the activity tab. finally someone says you have an order cancelled from kfc and the restaurant and i confirm it’s the restaurant, and they state we are sorry the order was cancelled by the courier you will be issued a refund. mind you, this was my 4th agent, third one being the worst stating that the order im inquiring about does not exist and since they can not come to a resolution they terminated the chat.

next day i get an email notification that a refund has been issued, the refund states $4.75, but the order was $62, my credit card was charged $62?!!!?

i contacted support, 3 agents, automated type of replies, telling me oh you need to talk to your bank it’s just a hold, you were never charged, then why am i getting an email telling me uber eats is issuing me a refund for $4? and why am i charged on my credit card for $62 (cost of that specific order) 

last agent told me that i will be issued a full refund, and what i am seeing on my bank app is just a temporary hold and that i was not even charged for the order, he also apologized and said that the order was cancelled by the restaurant, first they told me courier cancelled now they tell me restaurant cancelled, but my app stated order was cancelled by uber eats team itself. 

i have given up, their support system is garbage, i asked for a number to call they can’t even provide that and ended the chat. robbing people of their hard earned money, shame on them.",2024-10-12 06:19:11,0,13,Reddit,UberEats

ubereats delivering my order next door. in the last year my order has been delivered next door 3 times by 3 different drivers. no reason for this as my house is a regular house in a street of regular houses with my number clearly visible on the letterbox and house. i thought i fixed the problem by adding a pic of the front of my house and a message on the app saying to leave it on the bench seat next to my door and that the neighbour doesn't have a bench seat. yesterday they delivered next door after weeks of normal deliveries. i was going through the app to complain and found a map on the app of my area with house numbers. my house for no reason is a rectangular image of my house and the neighbours house connected as one and just the number of the neighbours house. is this the issue? do the drivers use this app map to get where they are going? do they not see the different number? i sent a message to uber to get this map fixed but no response yet. if they deliver next door again i'm just going to report it undelivered and get a refund while i'm eating it.,2024-10-12 00:52:00,3,10,Reddit,UberEats

my parents have state farm insurance meaning my car is covered, but uber eats won't accept it unless it has my name on it & thus won't allow me to do any more deliveries.

this is just a side gig for me to make some extra cash, so i'm definitely not going to fork over any extra money just to be added onto my parents' insurance.

surely uber as a corporation must be aware people live/drive with others & have vehicle insurance with their parents, partners, friends, roommates, etc to not always have it under their name, so how to i get around this?

"stolen order, does the restaurant have zero responsibility? i took a high paying order last night, i thought i got lucky. but when i went to the restaurant, the worker told me the order was already picked up by another driver.

he asked me, “can you click the button, another driver picked up the order and cancel?” 
i looked at the order detail, it was only 1 item, chicken shawarma. so i asked him “can you remake the order? it’s only 1 chicken shawarma.” but he refused. i asked him how much. i told him i would pay the half, and asked him to remake it at half the price. the worker said “no” he told me, if i want it remade, i needed to pay the full price. not wanting to waste my time, i cancelled order.

my question is, when a driver picks up the food and cancels the order, stealing the food, like the worker said, does the restaurant have zero responsibility? but, isn’t the worker supposed to check the confirmation button as the driver pick up the food? unless they know the driver is regular delivery guy, i think they should always check the order confirmation every time with the random drivers.

"worst company & customer service ever.  i never make posts on social media about stuff like this, but i am so infuriated by these scumbags i can barely see straight. here’s what happened: i ordered food, and it was delivered to the wrong address next door. i live in a residential building on the beach in the miami area. next door to me is a hotel/resort. the driver dropped the order off at the hotel, and in his verification drop-off photo, it literally shows the hotel’s name on the wall in the background. when i got the photo, i tried calling the driver to tell him he dropped off at the wrong location, and to please bring it back around to my building. he hung up on me 3 times. i called customer service. they told me that the driver reported that he dropped off at the correct location, and since that’s what the system says, there’s nothing they can do about it. so i explained to them, “the proof is in the delivery photo. look at the hotel name in the photo. look up the address. now look up my address in your system. those are 2 different addresses. so he is clearly lying.” “i’m sorry sir, he said he made the correct drop off and it’s in our system so there’s nothing we can do.” ok, now i need to speak with a supervisor. “they’ll call you back, let me take down your number.” this went on 3 days in a row, with no call. now, before i move on to the next phase, some of you might be thinking, “but sir, why not just walk next door and pick up your order?” that’s a different story- i was physically unable to do that. 

so today the supervisor calls. i get the same runaround. “our system shows that the driver dropped off at the right location, there’s nothing we can do.” i got him to admit that the hotel and my building are 2 separate buildings with 2 separate legal addresses, and if he dropped off at the hotel, then it is a lie to say he dropped off at the correct address, even if “that’s what our system says.” he refused to be fair, and was a condescending jerk. i think he enjoyed telling me he wouldn’t reimburse me. by their rationale, any driver can just drop off at the wrong spot, lie about it, and the customer gets screwed. i mentioned this flaw in their system, and he was basically like, yeah but so what. 

i paid $85 and they are absolutely refusing to reimburse me. their customer service “supervisor” acknowledges at the same time that, a) the address where dropped off is a different building with a different address, while saying b) the driver dropped off at the address i instructed him to. both can’t be true. but what else can i do? is there any other channel i can explore to try and get some justice here? it’s a matter of principle for me at this point.

"$16hr + tips      hi, i’m currently driving for uber eats and i need to report an issue i experienced during my shift. here’s what happened: uber said to work for the specific time 8 pm to 10:58 pm which i did, totaling about 3 hours, with a pay rate of $16 an hour plus tips. in that time, i completed 5 trips (which i only received) and made 3 deliveries. unfortunately, i had 2 cancellations: one was because another driver took my customer’s order, and the other was due to the restaurant not processing the food order, causing my customer to cancel.

     i reached out to an uber chat agent for assistance regarding these issues, but i was transferred multiple times without receiving any solutions or answers to my questions.

     after driving for 3 hours and only completing 5 trips, i didn’t even earn the guaranteed flat fee of $16 an hour. based on my calculations, i should have earned $48 plus tips.

     has anyone else experienced something similar, or does anyone have advice on how to resolve this issue? thanks for your help!",2024-10-09 14:28:20,0,20,Reddit,UberEats
ue cancellation rates  a little bit of a rant here. ue is quick to let you know about your cancellation rates but doesn’t take into account all the times when the order has been picked up by another driver. the percentage rate still goes up when i have nothing to do with it. nine out of ten times that i have canceled is because of the order not being there. but yet they still add a point.  they set you up to fail. it’s bs. but i guess that’s how uber works.,2024-10-09 13:52:41,1,5,Reddit,UberEats

"driver ratings back when i was driving, i never had an issue with my ratings and all i did was follow the directions that the customer requested. 

now that i travel a lot, i use delivery to the hotel that i'm in at the time for my meals. i get off work, get to the hotel, order food, then get in the shower. i always have it set to leave at my door because i'm ready for bed by the time i get back to my room. it's not difficult. 

but i have come to notice that drivers with a rating of 90% or more tend to be those that actually follow the directions whereas 89% and below usually end up with me having to get out and hunt down my food. you'd think that with a $15 tip of an order that is usually around $40-$50 with a drive time that i try to keep as short as possible so that i get it relatively quickly, it wouldn't be difficult to take the order to the second floor of a small hotel. 

with tonight's order, i'm just getting out of the shower and i get my first text from this driver saying, ""i'm leaving it at reception."" fine. i'm go get it. i get there (less than a minute and a half walk time from my door) and see that it's not on the desk. i ask the receptionist and she looks confused. so i go by the picture he sent and hunt down where he left it... outside the front door of the hotel in the cold. 

tip adjustment when giving a rating? definitely. $5 for the drive is the most i'm willing to give and i'm still thinking i shouldn't have. simple directions not followed and food was not left in a decent place. 

are drivers seriously that unaware of what causes the ratings they get?",2024-10-08 23:07:40,6,10,Reddit,UberEats

"uber eats job scam? i was outreached to by a random person on whatsapp. they had a strange but easy job for at uber eats. the url was u-ber-platform-cy.com. the job was essentially to confirm orders and push them through by simply just hitting a button. you would gain a few cents commission per order. the thing was you could only do 30 at a time. once you reached the 30 you needed to deposit money. once deposited you could 30 more. from what i was told you would cycle the money. so you would do your ""tasks"" deposit x amount then get your second set of tasks to then deposit. so you would be reusing your own money while gaining commission. 

  
the way to make money was off of consecutive logins. so completing 30 orders = completion of 1 task. you needed to complete 3 tasks a day to have it be considered a logged day. there were a ton of pamphlets and seemed sophisticated for a scam but something still didn't seem quite right. they had a pixelated picture of their state of ny certificate of status with an authentication number at the bottom.

so, is their customer service really that bad? is that even legal? they literally stole my money (and the driver my food) and there's absolutely nothing i can do because they don't have a customer service line. at least the app allowed me to edit the tip to $0.00.

"bidding vs tipping (a suggestion) i’m so tired of hearing people compare gig workers to servers when it comes to tipping. it’s completely different! i think gig workers should push to change the term in their apps from “tipping” a driver to “bidding” for a driver’s/ shopper’s time.

when i place an order for ue, i hope my bid/ offer is generous enough to entice someone into accepting it. for this amount of money, please go get my order from a store or restaurant, and then promptly bring it to me. after that, you have fulfilled your “obligation” to me and i’m happy. 

now, if that driver picks up additional items for me such as napkins, sauce packets, utensils, etc, they did extra work. or if the driver writes a note saying they’re waiting for the order/ on their way, that’s going out of their way a bit, so after, i’d like the option of leaving a “tip” for additional things that driver did. but i don’t think that’s a necessary component to fulfill the service, for the bid, that we have agreed to. 

the apps themselves could warn customers before placing an order if the “bid” is too low. “the average bid in this area for an order with that distance is $x and may take additional time to be accepted. are you sure you want to proceed or would you like to adjust your bid?” 

call it bid work instead of gig work. and then work to try and force these various apps to uncouple crap orders with good ones. and i think that would solve a lot of issues for many of you. 

anyway, i truly appreciate all of you (at least the good ones) and the effort and work you put into performing this type of service for people. i know that it’s hard, but many customers appreciate it. ",2024-10-08 08:39:54,8,7,Reddit,UberEats

for the newbies: back in 2020, uber increased subsidies for drivers and meals during its ipo, which also increased expenses for sales and marketing. moreover, they were also planning to cut the costs, and turned out that it could have influenced the overall growth. 



so, after all this news, their stock dropped (obviously) and investors sued them afterward.

"ubereats grocery price adjustment fraud these are the prices from my recent ubereats grocery delivery on oct 5 from sprouts market. for the following items, the prices uber charged me after order is delivered is higher than not only the app prices before order is placed, but also higher than the actual in-store receipt that i obtained from the delivery driver because i suspected something fishy in the final pricing. how is this allowed to happen, isn't this illegal / unethical? are folks aware of this? i've only seen this with grocery orders (not with restaurant orders thankfully), because they allow the price to be adjusted to match in-store prices, but are they hoping to fool customers to believe it because we don't always have access to the in-store receipt, and so any difference was likely in-store adjustment?

"uber eats bc changes from an uberx drivers perspective ok it took a good deal of experimentation and but i've finally figured out what they did with these recent changes in british columbia.   
  
in my market uberx takes about 50% of the fare with all fees included. as an uberx enabled driver (class 4 license etc.) we used to be paid uberx rates when doing uber eats deliveries. here is the thing. uber took 0% instead of the 50% on deliveries. not only that but there were up front tips on deliveries and people rarely tip here on rides. the result is that uber eats paid about double uberx + tip. that rate association is gone now. uberx drivers are no longer paid like this on eats orders and tips have become rare. both uberx and uber eats now average to about $20 per hour and it has become impossible to beat this algo enforced average. previously, i could have $60 or even more per hour during dinner rushes at times. $30-$40 deliveries were common. as an example i had a 21.6k offer for $10.43 yesterday. previously this would have been about $45. strictly speaking on the eats side the fares are no higher than before. $3-6 base fares are still common and even very long distance fares can be around $10 base pay. i have taken a greater than 50% pay cut with these changes. needless to say i'm not happy.

the worst part about all this is how it was marketed to customers and drivers. as a driver, particularly with the .45c mileage rate i believed this would be additional to what we were already getting. as a customer they have justified these increased fees as they are now paying us ""fairly."" they are not paying us more point blank period the end. uber has effectively added the average tip onto the customer fees side and effectively removed the tip to the driver to compensate. uber has lied to everyone.",2024-10-07 10:01:16,2,2,Reddit,UberEats

"order not delivered twice in two days hello everyone,

i am confused by an occurrence that happened twice in a row. 

on friday i ordered from popeyes, it took almost 2 hours for the food to be ready. i got the notification to be ready and to give the driver some time for drop off, but then i saw him on the map driving away. i messaged asking if everything was ok, and he told me he was filling up on gas. i am waiting downstairs in the apartment lobby. next thing i know, i get the notification that it was delivered. the picture of delivery is taken of the apartment building while he is still in the car and has no food in the picture. i called three times, and he wouldn't pick up. got uber to refund me.

on saturday, i ordered from chickfilla, and the same thing happens. it didn't take forever to be prepared like last time, but i  got a notification that it was delivered and it wasn't. the picture was taken of the food in front of the building next door. i tried to call right away, but they wouldn't pick up. i went to the building and it wasn't there. at most, it was like 3-4 minutes. i've also gotten refunded, but like...

both orders have been made in chicago, and the restaurant is a mile or two away. i am so confused as to why it happened twice. i want to highlight that the drop-off instructions are clear and that my apartment building has a drop off for food delivery that is not hard to spot.

any insights?

edit - thanks, folks. i think i got my answer. for the popeyes one, it seems like it got stolen by one driver, and another tried to get compensated by marking it delivered. the 2nd one was just stolen. i think it may just be a coincidence. in case you think it might have been because of my tip, i just want to note that i tipped one 4ish/one mile away and the other 5ish/2 miles away . both were over 15%. for the most part, i order fast food because otherwise i just cook at home. anything fancy, i would probably go out with friends. i can't drive, so pick up is not an option for me, but i am working on getting my license.

"rebuttals for ubereats delivery customers who feel they shouldn't tip or that drivers with standards are entitled lazy bums who don't want to work or get educated to live a better life. (long post warning)  so this post (i will post the link because i can't cross post it) has inspired me to list some rebuttals to what i find to be frankly, cheap disgusting inconsiderate sociopathic subhumans masquerading in their everyday lives as normal people. link at the bottom of the post

""you should get a better job if you don't like the pay""

rebuttal: everyones life circumstances and therefore job opportunities are different. some are within our control, some aren't. but whether it's our bad choices, life circumstances we couldn't control, or some combination of both, we are delivery people.

if everyone had a ""better job"" then there would be no delivery people, and you would have to get off your fat ass and pick up your own food, like people did before the invention of ubereats and door dash. 

i do have a better job, because i have standards and don't deliver to cheap assholes who don't tip, and if i do it's because uber has raised the pay to an acceptable level, which usually means you've waited an hour or two before your delivery was even sent to me.

""i already paid a fee""

rebuttal: yeah, and i'm getting two or three dollars from that if you don't tip. having the ability to order from almost any restaurant you desire within a 30 mile radius with on demand internet strangers bringing it to your door is a luxury, not an entitlement or life necessity. people in the 70s , 80s, 90s, and 2000s picked up their own food with no issues all day everyday. 

pay the additional upfront premium ""pre tip"" or ""bid"" to ensure rapid delivery, 

or don't and pray that you get a no standards, slave wages delivery driver, but this is a gamble, because you also risk there are no low standards drivers nearby, and the consequence will be waiting several hours, or getting your food stolen because a driver decided a free meal was higher paying than delivering to you for 2 dollars. pay the premium or gamble. not my problem. i don't deliver beneath my standards regardless, and this will not change. 

""take your problem up with uber/door dash, not the customer""

rebuttal: many drivers have. it hasn't changed our pay. so we just have standards. since many of you are complaining the fees are too high, why don't you take it up with uber or door dash? why is it up to us alone?  we can just set standards and not deliver to you, if you aren't paying at rate we require. so instead of telling me to protest uber or door dash, you protest uber or door dash. take your problem up with uber and door dash, not the drivers. 

i'm just going to keep delivering with standards of self respect and human dignity. 

""no one is forcing you to deliver"" 

rebuttal: no one is forcing you to order delivery. (literally your own words used on you in reverse)

cook at home, pickup your own food, pay the pre-tip aka ""bid"" premium for quick delivery, or don't and hope you get a no self respect delivery slave who will deliver for two dollars quickly, but this gamble could also result in waiting hours for your food, or it getting stolen because the free meal is higher paying than actually delivering the food.

bottom line. there is nothing to argue. you have choices. get food the old fashioned, pre ubereats and door dash invention way, meaning picking up your own food or cooking at home, pay the premium tip/bid premium, or don't pay while still ordering and take the gamble that comes along with that. you have been informed and warned. 

this is not about bad service or bad delivery experiences. that's a different discussion.

"staff are useless 
i’ve probably ordered uber eats around 200 times, and genuinely, only about four of the drivers have managed to find my house.

i know people might think, “well, if every driver is having difficulty, it’s probably something you’re doing wrong.” but i’ve checked the location from the driver’s perspective, and it genuinely couldn’t be easier to find. a big part of the problem seems to be that many of these drivers aren’t particularly tech-savvy and often struggle with the language. if everything goes smoothly, there’s no issue, but as soon as something slightly tricky happens, they tend to cancel the order.

i’ve literally just had a driver mark my order as ‘delivered’ without actually delivering it. when i contacted uber, they refused to refund me. so the driver essentially stole my food, and i didn’t get a refund. and to top it off, i’m an uber one customer!

it’s an absolute joke. you’ll never get in touch with a real person, and while i understand they might not have enough staff for direct support, why on earth would i keep using uber eats when they can simply refuse to refund me, even though i never received my order?",2024-10-07 05:00:50,0,23,Reddit,UberEats
"planning to start uber eats in durham region, ontario – looking for earnings estimates hey everyone,

i’m considering purchasing a car (likely a 2013-2016 model) to start doing uber eats in the durham region of ontario. i’m currently struggling to find a job after recently getting my az license, mostly due to not having any canadian experience, which has made things tough.

in the meantime, i’m thinking uber eats might help me manage my expenses while i keep searching for work in my field. for those of you doing uber eats in this area, can you give me an idea of how much i can expect to earn per week or month? any advice on what to consider before getting started would also be appreciated.

thanks in advance!",2024-10-07 01:11:23,2,8,Reddit,UberEats

in my region, the government requires online platforms to give gig workers a 72-hour notice prior to actual account suspension, with a detailed report indicating what are the issues. however, it seems like uber's fraud prevention team does not even look into the legal in my region and decides to do whatever they want. i mean, if they think there are some problems with me, they can send me a 72-hour notice, but they decided to do it in an illegal way? 

when i connected with the account team and asked the support to look into the legislation, he seems like panicking and refused to admit uber did it in an illegal way. 

they claimed that i was scamming them by delaying the service. however, the truth was my service even earned me tips from a customer yesterday (for drivers in bc, you know how hard it is since uber has almost removed the tipping feature), and i woke up with a deactivated account.

the walmart employee brought out two orders to my car and i immediately asked, how do i know which order is what.

the walmart employee told me i could not assist him with the orders and that he had to place them in my car himself and he would tag the orders.  he put one order in the front seat and 1 order. in the back seat and that's how he separated them.  easy peasy right?  there was only one tag per order to scan.   and both deliveries said one item, even though there were multiple items.  

maybe this is just how uber does it?  but how do i know whether the individual items are correct?  inevitably, i dropped off the bags to each location and the employee had had them all mixed up.

the trouble is the first customer i never even saw,  the instruction said to just leave them off on their ramp.   but the second customer met me, and that's when it was discovered.

"alcohol return + pin glitch? hey yall,

so normally alcohol returns aren't a problem, you just click the ""no valid id"" button and they'll pay you to bring it back to the store and the customer gets their refund. i've had it happen twice now though that i've had to return an order for a customer that had the pin option enabled and both times it didn't seem to work right.

the first time i hit the ""no valid id"" button and said yes i want to return it, then the pin option came up, i clicked through to say i couldn't confirm the pin and it prompted me to either cancel the delivery or say it was delivered, cancelling didn't seem right so i said delivered cause i wasn't sure what i was doing but then it seemed to assume the order was actually delivered (which makes sense), so it didn't prompt me to complete the return. this case actually ended up being more complicated after this issue came up, the customer called me and i was able to complete the deliver anyways after confirming with uber support (they were lovely), but regardless i did get paid for that initial order, though if i hadn't've been able to complete the order like i was initially expecting the customer wouldn't have gotten their refund.

the second time i went through the same steps, ""no valid id"", return the order, but when i clicked through the pin prompt i hit cancel order instead, assuming it would let me complete the return after that, but it didn't. i called uber support again and this time it took a while for them to understand what i was asking about, still not sure they actually did understand, but they told me to ""dispose of the order in a safe location"" (no idea what that means) and i didn't end up getting paid. i talked to the customer and it seemed like they did get their refund, and i was able to return the order to the store anyways, though i didn't get paid for the drive back. in this case this was a $6 add-on so i don't care about losing six bucks, i just don't wanna have to call support every time this happens, and i shouldn't have to choose between getting paid and the customer getting their refund.

i was looking at the details trying to figure out what part of the earnings were from tips but couldn't see any breakdown. then, almost an hour after my last trip, the customer tipped! i then realized that 88% of my deliveries did not tip at all!! two of them even had 4-5 flights of stairs. is that normal? 😂 i even made sure to greet, smile, and thank the customers but still, nada 😂

personally, when i used to order deliveries, i try my best to tip the ""norm"" in nyc because we'd always think delivery drivers don't make much at all with such thin margins with food pricing. i understand not tipping sometimes -- times are tough! but 8/9 of my rides didn't even bother with at dollar 😂

any advice to increase chances of tips? does the estimated trip earnings prior to accepting a ride include the possible tip already?

edit: seems people have turned this into an argument about why tips exists or if you don't like that you don't have tops, don't work here 😂 this post is about sharing what i experienced. not that hate customers for not tipping at all. i'm just surprised that they didn't, that's all!

she really wanted to make sure she tipped the driver and i finally suggested that she wait for a tip and rate notification, which did eventually come via email. 

is washington one of the states where drivers are required to be paid a regular minimum wage?  is this why they use a traditional tipping model, rather than the bidding model?",2024-10-04 14:46:12,2,12,Reddit,UberEats

i went from going to about $2 a delivery to about .01 per delivery aggregate pay. there is no transparency either. 

i’m going to look into complaining or at least find someone that wants to deal with this

"new driver - issues with android app. is this stuff normal?!@? i've only been doing this about a week, but have noticed several issues with the app and wonder if this is normal for everyone.

1. when i click on the next step in directions at the top to get the list of directions, half the time it won't go away, i have to kill the app and restart it.  very annoying as i'm usually just checking the next steps while stopped at a red light or something, don't have time to be messing with stuff.
2. if i turn off the screen while on a drive, it stops the voice directions.  i know sound is still on cuz i'm streaming music since i use a bluetooth to fm transmitter in an old car with only radio/cd.  is there any way to keep the audio directions on?
3. when i go somewhere to pickup food, sometimes it's not ready, so i like to review the directions to the delivery while i wait.  the only way i can seem to do this is by telling the app i already picked it up.  is there another way?  is there any downside to telling app i already picked up when i haven't?
4. battery drain is extremely high.  i have old phone with no fast charge mode, and i keep it plugged in every second i'm not out of the car (which is annoying for the people that say leave at door cuz i have to unplug the phone to take a photo) and with the app running i can barely get thru the day without running out of battery.  before using this app i never had any battery issues, only charged every couple nights.  i guess having screen and gps on drains battery.  any solution besides get a phone with quickcharge?

"uber refunded tip hi i ordered some food and left a tip.

i am not sure why/how but when i got my receipt, it had refunded the tip.

i am not sure if i clicked the wrong thing when rating it all. can a driver cancel it?

i am going around in circles through ""support"" and can't work out if i can re-add one after the fact. the prompts it says doesn't seem to be there for me.

the driver's contact info is not there, so i can't even apologise to him.

i can't find an email to speak to someone to see if they can process the payment for it.

"carrying weed packages. yesterday, a customer asked me to take a suitcase to a friend. this friend was supposed to return the same suitcase but with another package inside. i didn’t pay much attention and just did my job. when i finished the delivery, i stayed a block away from the original customer, waiting for more orders. suddenly, the app rang with the same order for the same person. i thought they had forgotten something, so fortunately, i was able to accept the delivery again.

then, out of nowhere, this woman shows up and yells at me, scared, saying i had stolen something because the suitcase i dropped off no longer had the package inside. i told her "" "" no, i never checked anything, and i had no intention of doing anything"". she then said that the package actually had weed or drugs indide it. so i asked her to calm down and offered to personally take her to that guy, who seemed to be her friend, so she could make sure all the things were collected.

when we arrived at her friend’s place, the guy, really pissed off and angry, grabs me by the neck and demands to see all the trips i had made. i told him to calm down, but he responded, ‘say that again, say it again, say it again.’ i told him again to calm down. he said, ‘say it again,’ and slammed me against the car door, trying to choke me. after that, i just stayed quiet. i got in my car and called the police, explaining the whole situation to them.

you have to be really careful with packages after 11:30 p.m. it was my first experience working with packages that late at night, and something like this had never happened to me before. what’s wrong with people? if you want to transport your weed or ilegal stuff, get a private driver and don’t drag us into your mess.",2024-10-03 21:28:43,0,66,Reddit,UberEats

i was kinda mad about it so went back online and had a instant $11 1am mcdonald's delivery. i run that quickly then ask the customer to give me a thumbs up at delivery. he's happy to, adds $3 to my tip, and my rating only went up to 82%

i dont care if its something crucial to the meal, im happy to reorder from them or another store even before i got the refund most the time, usually what is missing is something small, like 5-10% of the entire order size, i only had one order in the last 2 years where is warranted like a 50% refund

i plan on getting a written statement as proof from the restaurant that the driver forgot half the order.

what can i do with this, where do i go from here. at this point for the $15-20 loss that should be a clear cut case with tangible evidence / eyewitness statements, my impulse is to file in small claims court. along with damages for the cost of filing.

"could anything else go wrong? i submitted this to support and am waiting to hear back but this is too crazy not to share now. 

we placed an order for little cesars pizza. the order was a detroit deep dish sausage pizza, crazy bread, crazy sauce, and cheesy bread. 

we live in the suburbs and the location is several miles away and it’s rainy, so when i see that the delivery driver is on a bicycle i am already pretty concerned. 

the driver makes it about half way to our house before the location map freezes. the delivery time changes once, then twice, then three times. finally the driver arrrives with….

half the food. 

you see, the crazy sauce and cheesy bread “fell off his bike and although he backtracked he couldn’t find the food that had fallen on the ground. 

the “driver” was carrying the pizza in a backpack, so as you can imagine a pizza does not travel well when stored vertically for an hour (yes, an hour). 

so about the two items that remained. well, you see, the driver also had a cup of coca-cola in his backpack that was not part of our order. as you can imagine, riding a bike in the rain with a fountain drink in a backpack is a recipe for disaster. 

the coke spilled all over the pizza box and bag of crazy bread. they were completely soaked through. 

neither of the two items that actually arrived were at all edible. 

on top of all this, the bicyclist that delivered the order was not the person in the picture on the account (different apparent gender, different skin color, different hair & a face that looked nothing alike. 

i am still waiting to see if they will give me a full refund. 

the first answer back from uber eats support was a joke. they answered apologizing that we had a problem with how the food was packaged and that they will make the restaurant aware so it doesn’t happen again. nothing in my complaint mentioned packaging issues.

i contacted uber eats and they decided to give me 20%, which i denied and i asked to talk to a supervisor. i have been told i would be contacted in 12-24 hours and still got the 20% credit on account.

a week later i contact customer service and tell them i never got a supervisor to come back to me. they ask why and i re-explain the issue and they just say i have received a credit and they cannot do anything and closed my ticket. i tried reoppening the ticket and asking that i get to finally talk with a responsable adult rather than a kid with a script (no i have not told them that, i stayed polite all throught the chat (so far)). but so far they just give me the silent treatment. currently 11 days since event and 4 and 1 days since trying to reopen case.

what should have been done to prevent driver to just decide to ruin my day? i tip fairly even if uber eats make me tip over delivery fees, services fees, random bullshit fees and taxes... so that's not the issue. i assume the driver was just too busy doing runs closer to him but still...

at that point nearly 30 minutes had passed since i first saw the offer on my screen. and uber not only had the audacity to send it again, but make a pathetically low fare even lower, even as the customer’s food had probably been sitting on a shelf getting cold for all that time. obviously no other drivers wanted that order, but they still refused to raise the fare. do they even want this person to get their food? because if uber never offered more than $4, they’re probably still going hungry. and if not, they got room temperature food. the penny pinching of this company is just ridiculous.",2024-10-01 00:51:04,18,25,Reddit,UberEats
"cancelled order because store refused to give correct items **before you read: yes, i know that they are likely allowed to do this because of tos. i am just sharing because i thought i had seen everything using this service for years, but this was new to me, so i'm sharing so that people don't fall into the same trap. yes, i will stop using ue. no, i can't do a chargeback, because i use ridesharing and need to have multiple options (at least uber and lyft) since they are both known to do shady deactivations. so if anyone has other ridesharing services they know of in houston, lmk.** 

  
a few nights ago i had some friends over. i used ubereats to order snacks and some alcohol (2 6 pack tall boys of lone star). the driver called and said the 7/11 was refusing to give 2 quantities of the beer, saying on his end it said only one. the driver showed him the app that clearly said 2 for 6.99 each (13.98, which is what i was charged). still he refused and was only going to give the driver one. when i was told this on the phone, i told the driver i was sorry and that i knew it wasn't his fault but if the order wasn't complete, it would need to be cancelled. i did not cancel the order in my app. from my past experience, if the driver cancelled it, i wouldn't be charged. this is why i asked the driver to cancel. this is because i was going to place an order elsewhere if they were refusing to fill it as ordered. 

the driver did advise he could just bring it and then i could ask for the refund from uber on the item after it arrived. i knew from experience they would refuse to refund it and that's why i asked him not to deliver an order that we all knew was incomplete. i have ordered ue almost daily for years (i know i know, don't come for me, i know). and the times that i've had issues i used to get refunds, now i don't anymore. i know they have an internal limit, but i'm not sure how they calculate it. but i did know that they would refuse to refund the missing item. i had pretty much just accepted at this point that if they mess something up, i won't get a refund. but what happened with this order crossed a line. 

the driver told me everything was taken care of and that he got on the phone with uber to ""make sure i didn't get screwed over."" the order still showed active in the app for a while and at one point said heading your way, but the driver said he never actually took the order. eventually, it's cancelled in the app (not on my side, i did not use the app to cancel). 

so here's what i get left with. the entire charge for the order 26 dollars, plus a 25 dollar ""alcohol return fee"" (mind you, according to the driver, he never left the store with it). 

i talked to customer service and you all know what they told me. there's nothing they can do. reminds me of that sketch on fantasmas about insurance (go watch it). 

if i had known this, i would have just accepted the order. but this is fully ridiculous. over 50 dollars for an order that was only declined because it was going to be incorrect, for items i never received, for an order that wasn't even cancelled on my end, but on the driver's end!!!

"uber eats snuck in £5 delivery fee?  i've been ordering from a shop about a half mile from my house lately since it's convenient. the fees are usually about £2. i went to place my order tonight as usual. after i had done so, i noticed the total was way higher than usual and took a look at the breakdown. there was a £5 deliver fee (in addition to the service fees and all that).

now, i get that uber eats does surge pricing, although i have never actually seen them do it in my area. but don't they usually warn you? in the regular uber app it usually has a pop-up come up to say it's 2.5x the price due to a surge. it seems like they just snuck this in with the *intent* of sneaking it in, which seems really shady. 

i've been having trouble with them not refunding for wrong orders lately too and was wondering if maybe they hadn't somehow snuck this in to ""punish"" my account specifically? it just seems really predatory. i wouldn't have placed the order if i had known they were going to do this. i'm a pretty heavy uber user and an uber one member. i am far from a happy customer usually of course, but this just seems downright shady and might finally get me to stop using the platform at all.

when you come to a hotel or place of business with a receptionist, if they are currently assisting someone else, please just join the line and patiently wait for your turn. i understand you have a job to do, but i too, have a job that i am at. i cannot just push a guest to the side because you need elevator access. and yes, i will need to verify information from you before i can send you up to a guest's room. it's a process that takes quite literally like 30 seconds. it'd also be appreciated if you could refrain from shoving your phone in our faces as

 1.) i don't know where to look on your app for the information i need - it's a lot easier if you just have the room number and name of the customer ready to provide. 

2.) i personally find it quite rude to do so - especially when you neglect to speak a single word

if we can work together, the delivery can go so much more smoothly and without annoyance on either of our ends. please don't interrupt a conversation, the person i'm talking to, their time is also valuable and are in fact paying customers of mine so much like you're trying to assist your customers, i am also trying to assist mine. 

i understand you may be in a time crunch, but ultimately, that truly is not my problem. you have your customers contact information readily available - as you're approaching the hotel, start messaging your customer that you are on route and to meet you in the lobby - that can save you time and headache.

thank you <3

message the driver he refuses to acknowledge, when he gets there he verbally agrees address he was sent to doesn't match address on order but too far so he leaves it there along a fence line and completes the order. 

i figure ok instacart customer service no problem--  nope. i get sent to ubereats who refuses a supervisor or any common sense conversation. don't even understand us addresses. extremely rude and eventually just hang up. then the supervisor who calls is even more rude and refuses any additional help. am i wrong in thinking there is no way this is gonna fly with an american based company?",2024-09-30 08:28:03,2,4,Reddit,UberEats

"haha made you wait, boozehound. edit: i would have still done this if it were a food order. the only difference is that i’d have used “hangry biotch” instead of “boozehound.” the point is not that it was a bottle of liquor; the point is that this person felt it necessary to message me within minutes of me accepting the order, demanding to know where i was. i’m all about great service and even occasional acquiescence, but i still draw lines. 

…

got a small and obviously untipped liquor order that i accepted because it was a short trip and i was trying to maximally cash in on a quest. i was delivering the first of two other deliveries when i accepted the liquor order. the liquor store was about a half mile from my second drop off, and the customer was less than a mile from the store, so i thought “what the hell, might as well…”

five minutes later as i was pulling up to the second delivery the liquor customer messaged me, “r u lost????”

instant cancel. i no longer cared about my cancellation rate, fulfilling the quest, or any of that. and now this b has to wait even longer. ha!

moral of the story: if you need a bottle of henny that urgently at 2:00 in the afternoon, maybe go get it yourself. paying a delivery service doesn’t mean it magically and instantly appears at your front door. sometimes you have to wait a few minutes. that’s life, sis. oh well.

"refusing refunds for missing items - refund limit? asking for some crowdsource thoughts especially those that navigated the following successfully. thanks in advance!

**situation:**

i mostly use the amex plat uber credit for uber eats, and have been doing so happily. lately however quality control on delivered food being accurate has been in steady decline. items sometimes are outright incorrect. most often items are missing (almost always the drinks), especially when part of a combo. early on during covid when i ordered a lot more frequently this almost never happened - but now it seems to be nearly every time. it's only a few bucks each time, but it really adds up.

**ubereats support:**

in a nutshell horrible, it's auto scripts with decision trees. and what i experienced recently due to asking for refunds too frequently is being outright denied... here's a sample response from a message thread after escalation

    ""after looking into this order and the information provided, it was determined that the delivery matches the order. therefore this order can't be refunded. 
    
    in addition, after reviewing your account, we’ve noticed repeated violations of our refund policy. we encourage you to review the uber community guidelines if there are further questions.""

that was for two drinks not included as part of combo meals. the drink selection even has a line item charge for an additional $3+ dollars so it's clear how much the drinks are valued at.

the [community guideline](https://www.uber.com/legal/en/document/?name=general-community-guidelines&country=united-states&lang=en) has zero mention of refund policy - basically a red herring. and asking for specifics on ""repeat violations"" goes unanswered with continued auto closing of the ticket.

**amex related focus:**

1. i can open a dispute but from what i read online this can risk uber recharging me on their side and/or shutting my account down. has anyone had experiences with situations like this? i have to open issues with ubereats right now and both add up to about $15 total. has anyone had retaliatory experiences from uber as a result of multiple disputes? i have only used the amex dispute once before (not for uber) and it was very effective but it was with a merchant i will never use again so i don't care if i get blocked from future purchases. this leads to #2
2. uber $15 back a month whether it's wallet cash or it now being the credit on the statement is a key benefit of the card. if uber blocks me as a customer i lose out on this perk. does anyone have any experience with amex providing alternate benefit opportunities to make up for this loss? i don't use uber rides reliably enough to rely on it monthly, i do travel a lot for work but that's all expensed on a corp card.",2024-09-29 13:07:30,3,8,Reddit,UberEats

"(rant) won’t get a full refund as they think a mcplant burger is only £1.10 i placed an order for 2 mcplant burgers and paid £1.10 on each of them for an extra vegan patty on each. 

both arrived with only a single patty each, so as i e done before, i call up to get the £2.20 refunded. 

instead i get told that i’m only getting £1.43 as they think that a mcplant meal is £1.10. they won’t look online, they insist that i’m wrong, and after multiple calls to finally get a manager. the manager ended the call. 

during the call i kept asking them what £1.10 x 2 is and they all refused to answer me. their reasoning for this is because they think the burger only costs £1.10, not the extra patty. 

i’ve worked at call centres doing a similar role. i know what it’s like. all i wanted was the £2.20 refunded back, nothing extra, no asking for compensation, or extra fees refunded. i am gobsmacked at how bad their customer service is.

i was walking over and yelled “are you delivering the order to (my name)? you went to the wrong place” - not angrily - just to get his attention. he starts saying i shouted at him & put the wrong address in, including saying that “i’m not his effing parent” and i should “learn my effing place” and yell at my own kids, and that i don’t even know his age. i say “if parcels etc get delivered to the right place, it’s my address, even if you say your satnav sent you to the wrong place i then sent you a description of the building”. he starts squaring up and saying i’m just attacking him and i’m violent (i’m 5’2 in a fluffy purple dressing gown), i start crying as he asks for the code, he says i’m looking for sympathy and it’s pathetic, i say it’s because i have a 40°c temperature and he accuses me of lying. when he says it’s gone through and hands me the item i literally run back to mine, in tears, and in the lift i get the notification that he’s cancelled the order. i haven’t heard back from uber yet, i don’t know if i’ve reported it via the right place, but i can prove he messaged me and have his full name. does anyone know anything else i can do? uk based if that helps.

"customer service switch up the other day i had ordered wine from uber eats opposed to doordash because i noticed they had a cheaper price than what i would usually pay. once my driver got there, his app wouldn’t let him scan my id for some reason and i spent about 10 minutes sitting outside my door hoping the app would start to work. poor guy felt so bad and called support to resolve it in front of me. he confirmed my dob with them on the phone and he said they would call me to confirm i received my order. they called and i confirmed with them, and they said there was nothing more i had to do on my end and to have a great night.
the next morning, i woke up to a 25 dollars “cancellation fee”. of course, this immediately pisses me off as i never cancelled the order and i was not at fault for anything that happened with my order. i reached out to customer support expecting it to be a misunderstanding, explaining what i basically just have to you guys, and their response was actually shocking.
i was told i was charged for the guy at hyvee (the store i ordered the wine from) having to restock my wine since “i” cancelled it. after i literally just explained that i received my wine and that they have a recorded call of me saying this. i was basically told it was completely my fault and i would not get the charge taken off my account.
again, i tried to fight back on this and said they must have not read my message. i re explained everything and got another message that there was nothing they could do, as it was my fault.
i am pisseddddd at this point. i looked on reddit and saw other people say they have reported uber eats to the bbb, and i absolutely took that and tan with it. 
i explained to them that the app was going to be deleted on my phone, and that i had seen they had a history of scamming people for cancellation fees. i told them i planned to report them to the bbb this morning.

however, my last pickup today was 2 orders at pizza hut for the same customer. when i arrived the employee said he handed them out to the previous driver. i contacted uber eats chat, as to not affect my rate. however, afterwards my cancellation rate increased to 8%. 

i ended up calling uber support and immediately requested a supervisor explain them the situation and they claim that these are new standards that were updated. i asked for something in writing or where i can see these new terms or agreements but she refused to provide anything and said there was nothing else she can do for me. needless to say i am furious as this is borderline illegal. not only are you not compensated for your time, gas, effort, or wear and tear on your vehicle but now they are negatively affecting your cancellation rate which then in turn affects your account status/types of orders you get.

"not dressed properly for the job?? so last month around august time i was doing a late night delivery for a diner.  now, before i even got out of my car, i could see this creepy old guy behind the diner’s counter staring at me from the front window as i was parking/walking in. i thought nothing of it and assumed he was trying to be helpful. 

i get inside and say “hi, uber eats?” 

then he looks at me all confused and goes “uber eats??! uhhh uhh, what’s the name?” 

then i gave him the name.

then he goes “uhh uhh. go over there. uhhh, it’s over there! yeah, go to the left over there. uuuuh yeah. (there was no order to be seen in that direction) 

at this point i’m assuming he’s a little confused or tired or something, but thinking nothing badly of the guy, so i quickly dart in that direction to ask someone else. 

then he stops me and goes “and hey! next time… shirt! ok? 

then it dawns on me… he’s blathering about the fact that i’m wearing a wifebeater instead of a regular t shirt, and how i guess that’s not allowed?? anyway, i just looked at him for a second, laughed, and asked someone else who helped me immediately with no shirt comment whatsoever. 

now, getting back to my point of this post: is it wrong to wear a wifebeater as a shirt when doing uber eats? i wasn’t sweating or anything, and i was groomed/bathed and i had socks on. it was a cool summer night and where i live it’s pretty normal to see men wearing these in the summer. 

btw, i was pissed at the guy after this, so on my way out. i said to the guy who helped me “thanks, have a good one.” and i made sure to say it really loud so the creepy old guy would think i was talking to him, and he did! 

so like a fish biting a hook he said “yes, no problem. have a good night.” 

and so i was able from there to leave on a high note, hitting him with a “i wasn’t talking to you, i was talking ya friend who’s actually working over there.” boom! out! food delivered successfully. 




disclaimer: i respect my elders. he wasn’t that old, middle aged. i just keep calling him the old guy for the purposes of roasting him and consistency in the story

"is bump-back glitch only on double orders? so, it is clear now after reading around and experiencing it firsthand that uber has a huge technical issue today with the app. i just had to call support because i had a double order. after confirming pickup for first and second customer, and then confirming first dropoff, en route to the second dropoff, the app jumped back to the first customer pickup stage in the batch. when i tried to just reconfirm it, it showed an error text about the inability to complete the attempted action, so i was just essentially stuck and softlocked into the current overlay it had. support somehow force completed[cancelled] the order that was already marked dropped off in the system, and it then allowed me to mark the 2nd as delivered. my question is, has anyone had this issue with single orders? my thinking is, if this is only due to the current inability for uber to handle juggling procedures for more than one customer in a single batch, then if i only target singles and dont take add-ons, or complex orders like shop and pay, i should be safe from this crippling dilemma, in theory. also, for the people that have been saying to implement the force-stop strat via settings: i tried it once on my own, and support also advised it- it did not work either time.",2024-09-26 22:11:35,1,2,Reddit,UberEats

"i can't communicate with driver. neither can support. order was never received and refund was denied because the driver marked it as delivered. what do? i'm a us customer in the us (relevant) and just placed an order. when tracking shows the driver was here, i got several calls from them in a language i don't speak. i tried my best to figure out what they were trying to communicate, but they eventually hung up. then they marked the order as delivered when it wasn't.

i called support, they reached out to the driver, also couldn't get an explanation specifically because of the language barrier, then denied the refund because it was marked as delivered (no picture, btw). i was speaking to the same rep for the entire process.

"does uber really hold good tipping orders hostage until they find a garbage no tipper heading same way?  yes,yes,and yes. you cannot tell me otherwise. ubers algo has order time and promised time. when the system notices a good tip on a order that just got placed, it takes it time to dispatch the order. looking for trash from nearby restaurants heading in the general area of the good tipper. trying to batch it together to still make offer look lucrative. they do this to get trash offers accepted as a batch, while not paying the driver 2 separate delivery fees.

ever notice how you can be sitting at a strip mall directly in front of restaurant and a single  good paying offer comes in? you walk in and to your amazement, the order whether it be large or not is either done or almost done?  it's the algo stalling the order trying to find trash to go with it, but times up, the order has to go by itself.

any driver with half a brain should have this figured out after a few weeks. and if you really know the area your delivering, make sure to watch the trash offers pickups and drop offs. it helps you decipher which one to cancel in a batch offer.

please drivers, work smarter... 20 deliveries per day to make 120.00, minus 40 in gas, and 250 miles, is not as profitable as 10 deliveries to make 90.00, 10.00 in gas, and 60 miles. drive that algo price up already.

"trains and trucks (semis) i completely understand the purpose and point of needing to transport manufactured goods, chemicals, vehicles, etc. across the country. i completely understand that businesses need to get their products from the manufacturers. i get that. 

what i do not understand is how they completely deregulated railroad industry is allowed to have 6 to 10 mile trains that literally park across the main roadways of two to four cities at a time. 

i don't understand why so many towns have to suffer the complete division of transportation due to this. what i'm talking about is what happened this morning. 

i had a delivery going 8 mi that would have taken me 14 minutes. every single roadway between the restaurant and the delivery address has a railroad crossing. on every single railroad crossing, there is either a train moving at about 5 mph or a train parked blocking the road. and both of those trains are easily 10 miles long. what was supposed to be a 14-minute delivery just took me an hour and a half.

regarding semis or trucks, i get it that they must transport huge quantities of merchandise and supplies to local places, many of those were previously on a train.

what i don't understand is the need to have literal convoys of 20 or 30 semis driving through neighborhoods not even on main roadways but on one-way streets with barely enough room for a standards pickup truck where they have to drive less than 5 mph to avoid ripping off everyone's side mirrors. 

i know this all comes with the road. this all comes with driving. this is the nature of the economy, but i feel like there's just too much. too many things interfering with navigation of the community. and while most of the semi drivers and long road truckers are very considerate of everyone around them, there are some who are just total a-holes. not all but some very noticeable handful of drivers who treat every vehicle around them as an obstacle to either overcome or block from moving around or following them.

in general, it makes me want to just sell my car and stop everything. just just give up you know? but i'm not going to do that because i've got bills to pay. 

and for those who say just quit doing this, i don't have a choice. i'm at the age of no one wanting to hire me for the degree that i got from a fraudulent college. but that's beside the point. 

most of the time, i enjoy doing uber eats. most of the time, it's not as bad as i described. but this morning, it's just been a nightmare of 50 or so. semi trucks and two trains walking. literally three main roadways in chicago suburbs for over an hour. and that's not even counting metra.",2024-09-26 06:44:55,0,2,Reddit,UberEats

"just a reminder for those in florida… 
it is not worth going out in this weather to deliver food. i’m sure some people will try to but no money you could make on the apps is worth it. ue and dd are notorious for trying to convince people to go out ‘real quick’ right before it gets bad enough for them to shut it down. usually the last 3-4 hours you’re going to get multiple notifications about how busy it is and the money to be made. 

this is not true. most of these restaurants are closed, and that will raise the fares, only for them to be worthless upon arrival. this is a tactic by them to get those orders that are available delivered, instead of having a shortage of drivers. 

everytime one of these storms hit there is always the “went out to dash and ended up in 8 ft of water ruining my car!” posts. do not be that fool this time around because you got caught 15 miles from home trying to deliver a ‘unicorn’ when it gets really bad.

there is no other word for what they do. a scam. 

like the people that steal granny’s life savings. yeah that’s the breed.

they bought out postmates and now made a deal with instacart.

they keep saying that if the promotion was a valid one it would have applied automatically, they also will tell me and him that a specialist team has been notified of our issue and will be reaching out by email asap give them 12 to 24 hours. like i said it's been over a week the only email we got was that someone would be reaching out by email lol. we have talked to about 10 different agents at this point, i've asked to speak to supervisors and been denied every time, and when i start asking to speak to supervisor or my son asked to speak to the supervisor suddenly the chat agent will send a message summarizing what we discussed in our chat and then they disconnect the chat and that's it. 

i made a twitter account just to try and get this issue resolved and i have spoken with support on twitter they keep telling me the same things that the chat support in the app has said, sending me long messages about privacy and how my son has to be the one to contact them and that especially team is notified and will be reaching out. it's been two days since they've responded to any of my messages and my twitter account was shadow band because i was tweeting at uber and twitter decided that i am spamming. 

i think the answer is basically going to be that they aren't going to fix this, and that they just don't care. so since that is most likely going to be the solution that they come up with to just ignore us until the last day the promotion is available and then tell us that well the promotion no longer exists, how do i permanently delete my account and his account? i know uber won't care that they lost to customers like they clearly don't care about any of their customers, but i don't want an uber account anymore if this is how we're going to get treated. this isn't the first time that customer support has been really bad but this is the first time that even with proof of a promotion they wouldn't honor it.

"could someone explain this why certain businesses hate us: i have been on uber eats for several years now.  for the life of me, every once in a great while i will come across a restaurant that hates gig drivers.  the owner complains that it ruins their business because we cause a hold up from all the orders that they receive.  in this particular case this restaurant doesn’t have prepaid orders from uber, the drivers order the customer’s requested food, use their uber card, and then deliver.

so my question is why is that such a bad thing?  it’s like if i walked into that same restaurant and ordered food to go, paid with my own credit card, and leave.  i am still considered a customer right?  does my order and other uber driver’s order, pay, and deliver really impact a business negatively? i can understand the price increase that uber charges the customer but that’s because it’s a luxury/convenience service being provided.  is the restaurant owner mad because of this?  after all, the customer could just avoid the price hikes and go down to the restaurant themselves.

perhaps someone can shed some insight to this unless there is another thread i can look at.  right now in az, i have 5 places i will never order food from with uber as they are rude and treat us like a virus.  other restaurants welcome us with open arms but that’s a different story.",2024-09-24 15:44:27,17,58,Reddit,UberEats

last night i accepted an order to taco bell and then another order was added on. i got to taco bell at 12:30 am and it was packed. the guy at the pick up station told me it’s gonna be a long time and he doesn’t know how long because they need to keep making the orders that are placed in the store before to go orders. he says maybe 20 minutes maybe longer. he has no idea.

so i called uber support to let them know. the woman i talked to said they don’t recommend i wait and that she could give me $3 compensation for each order. she assured me that it would not affect my cancellation rate. i honestly almost didn’t cancel because i could have used the extra $5 between the two orders, but it was late so i decided to just go home.

 this morning when i logged onto the app it said i had two cancellations and my cancellation rate is higher than average for my area. i called delivery support and they said it shouldn’t count against my cancellation rating and they needed to transfer me to account services to fix the problem. account services insisted that even if an uber support agent cancels the order because of high wait time, it still counts towards my cancellations. i went through this process twice to see if different people would say different things or i could get a better explanation. twice the delivery support people told me that if an order was delayed they never recommend that the driver wait and the cancellation would not affect my rate. and consistently the account service reps told me the opposite. 

i’m feeling super frustrated. i only received two orders all day today and i’m afraid it’s affecting how many orders i get. has anyone gone through this or do you have any idea of something i could do to get it fixed?",2024-09-24 01:35:02,0,26,Reddit,UberEats

"ads on delivery bags hii everyone,
i do uber eats in toronto. i was wondering that i travel so much in toronto downtown area on my e-bike, somewhere about 70-80 km per day in average and many people would have noticed my delivery bag too.

- i think if i put some brand advertising on my delivery bag, it could work as a small billboard on the wheels.

- it will potentially get more views than a static billboard.

- i know about 50-60 people in my network who do uber eats on e-bikes regularly.

- will any brand be willing to put ads on the delivery bags, i can provide them a monthly subscription.

- it will be beneficial for both the parties. 

- businesses getting more impresions and delivery persons getting extra income.

- and i believe it will totally comply with uber's terms and conditions as uber terms the delivery partners as contractor, so we are free to use any e-bike, do any advertisement on delivery bag etc.

is it a good idea to invest my time in? just wanted to share, to get feedback from potential customers.

"uber turned me into a ghost.......... 2500 deliveries 97 percent rating never had issues until uber started counting cancels against us no matter what.  i was at 7 perecent cancel rate until i was completing a good delivery on saturday.  we all know it loves to jam, the crap orders at us when we are trying to complete a delivery, well i lost finger discipline for a second and accidentally accepted a order from walmart.  8 stacked orders for $12.57.  dammmmmnnnnnn it, so my cancel rate shot up to 19 percent after dropping those orders with support.  

  
so since i'm facing deactivation anyway i started taking the 45 dollar stolen orders.  first one got cancelled on the way to ""deliver"" so free 45 bucks there, next one was a hand to customer, so just slow roll on by and complete the delivery, too bad it was just handoff no picture required.  customer called a few times but i jyst ignored them and got the free 46 dollars.  nary a peep from uber support.

"acceptance rate not updating - as well as other rates i’ve been driving for uber since 2021 and have over 3000 deliveries. things were fine up until a couple months ago, i started to have real issues with the app that were out of my control. 

ever since they’ve made it important to keep your rates up, my acceptance, completion, and satisfaction rates have not been updating properly. 

one delivery about a month ago, i had to cancel because the restaurant moved and didn’t exist in the spot. i did not want this to affect my completion rate, as that would have put my completion rate past 10% to 11%, disabling my platinum tier. so i contacted support. they asked if i would like to cancel. i said i don’t mind taking it but i’m afraid i will get a bad rating, so if it will not affect my completion rate, then i will go ahead and cancel. the support assured me confidently that it will not affect my rating. so i said go ahead. immediately the completion rate gets raised 1%. 

i am infuriated so i called support and spoke to another person. i explained to them what was going on and how it changed my rating. then they said something that really surprised me. my completion rate was not 11% but it was 8%. and my acceptance rate was higher than what i saw as well. he said let’s troubleshoot, let’s uninstall and reinstall the app. i did that.. no change. and i doubted this was even the problem because my rate instantly changed as soon as the last on got cancelled. they assured me it should update eventually and that i was still in platinum even though my app was saying it’s disabled until i get my rate back down. 

so, what i was seeing was totally different from what uber support was seeing. 
i do have to admit, this data thing does make it convenient for them to just show you whatever to pay you less money by getting you falsely de-tiered. 

and you dont even have total control when you get orders that are impossible to complete. another issue that i have been facing a lot. i have been receiving orders that will suddenly disappear from my screen and it will say in the details that i myself cancelled. let me tell you, one of these was a $20+ order and i did not cancel it. when i got to the restaurant, it was gone off the screen. it also happened again with a double order. as soon as i picked up the first one, it was immediately gpsing to their house and i thought that’s weird.. i look in my details and it says i myself again had cancelled. now there are also other times where the order is already picked up or for some reason i cannot pick it up. i will call customer support to avoid affecting my rating. they assure me it will not, but it changes every time. i have no control over these situations and i get punished while i waste my time and get no pay and usually can’t even get a petty incentive of $3. and i get de-tiered. 

i tried to contact a supervisor for these issues now. and for days they kept sending me the same message with a different supervisor, saying they are looking into the issue and that they will come back with an answer when they’ve resolved it. after the 5th person, i said ok or you actually going to give me a resolution and fix my account? i do not want another copy and paste message. 

the message was ended. 
and i took screenshots of it all. i have evidence of it all. 

in the present moment, my completion and acceptance rates are under control but now my satisfaction rate of 94% has not changed in a month. i have had very happy customers tip extra and i don’t doubt i should at least have had some kind of change. i had a lady tip me extra in cash and in app and you’re telling me she didn’t leave a thumbs up?? 

clearly, uber is playing games here with their system. and before you say you don’t have an issue, they don’t go after everybody at once. my theory is that they go after people who tend to cherry pick with higher average per deliveries (because i cannot afford to kill my car with a debt to still pay) which is what this job is turning into. i went from easy $200 a day to a struggle $150. and judging by the updates, they are making it more competitive, more strict, and generally more difficult for the driver to make money. eventually they will probably affect you if they haven’t already. 

and what’s great is that nothing can be done about this? it’s all just “factual” data and you have no real people who can help you. they just throw you in an endless loop until you give up(welcome to the future). or is it possible uber drivers can keep this company in check by working together? it seems farfetched but that’s the only way this company won’t step allover its contractors.

"can someone explain to me the logic behind tipping on a percentage? i typically order sushi without any soup, drinks, liquid etc. it's an expensive but physically small order that's easy to carry and deliver. the place is about a mile from my house. easy parking and virtually always ready on time. frequently it's around $100. tipping 15 or 20% would be a $15 or $20 tip. it's way less work than delivering a combo from mcdonald's, which is physically more food and includes a drink. i feel like my $15 tip for sushi is subsidizing all of the small mcdonald's orders that tip $5. why should tipping be based on a percentage of order cost?

i'm all for being generous, and in most situations i tip well. i just don't think the small fast food orders are viable for uber eats without subsidies from orders like my sushi order, and i would rather the platform charge more for those small orders, even if they don't charge me any less. i just want everyone to pay their fair share.

edit: i’m not trying to start a driver versus customer war, or saying drivers don’t deserve tips. i think everyone should tip generously. i’m trying to understand why tip suggestions are based on percentage of order value, rather than distance traveled or physical size of order or some other metric that correlates with the amount of work in delivering the order",2024-09-22 10:42:26,0,76,Reddit,UberEats

"i accidentally marked that i didn't receive my order and removed the tip, but i found the food. i tried fixing my mistake with ubereats and they will not fix it! so frustrated! long story short, although i had marked ""meet at door,"" the driver left the food outside. i checked the app, saw it was marked delivered, opened my door, looked on the front porch, and saw nothing. this was the first time this had happened to me. i went to the app, marked it not delivered, got a refund, downrated the delivery guy, removed his tip, and then got my keys so i could go pick up some damn food myself. i was mad.

as i was leaving my house, there my food was! in a blind spot i didn't even know existed, unable to be seen from standing right at the door. i realized the driver had probably put it in this sort of hidden corner so that when i opened the door, the food wouldn't be in the way of the screen.

so, i feel terrible, and i go to the app to try to fix it, and here is what happened.

* ue: we really appreciate your membership. this is x and i'm so glad to be connected with you today.

* me: okay you are not understanding my messages
* since the order was already refunded, we can no longer reverse back the refund.
* me: okay and you can't add tip from your end?
* me: here is the problem. the driver is going to be penalized for something that wasn't his fault
* ue: no, \_\_\_. we don't have an option to add a tip on our end.
* me: i am trying to fix my mistake but it can't be fixed?
* ue: i understand your concern, \_\_\_. we suggest that you pass this feedback directly to your delivery person by rating your experience with him in the app. this will help delivery people that he wasn't at fault to what happened to this order.
* me: i can no longer rate him now that i already gave him a bad rating based again, on my error
* ue: in the future, once the order was recently marked as complete, try looking around for possible locations where the delivery person might drop off the order

"'missing' food from the bag.  so i ordered kfc from ubereats today - it was $17 order. i tipped $2 on the app, and $3 cash in person. i also waited for em at the gate, so they don't have to drive around.

when i received the bag, it seemed little too small for my order. i was confused because it had a brown paper bag with nothing inside.

i called the store right away, and the lady who made my food was so certain that she packed it inside the brown bag with utensils (the bag was completely empty when i opened it)

it could be a coincidence, but my order was missing 1 pc out of 8 pc chicken order as well, so could it be that the driver went thru it before me? 🤢

i reported about it to ubereats and they said they will investigate it. have you had an experience like this?

  
+ edit:  now i think about it, it was kind of unusual(?) that the driver had their profile pic taken in complete pitch dark, nothing was visible about their face. i couldn't recognize him when i first met him in person. so i thought it was odd.

+ edit 2: ue refunded me part of the order. so it's all good at the end. next time i'll tip only on the app 😅

i was looking at the app and noticed that i couldn't keep track of the miles from when i worked earlier in the year. i worked for jan-feb and then took a break until september. 

my tax summaries are 100% incorrect. i'm not sure how or where uber is getting the numbers. they claim that i've made 800 out of pocket for the month of january. after counting the numbers, i only made 470 from trips that month. same thing with february, they claim i made 700, i only made about 300. 

again, i only worked for jan-feb, but when i look at my march tax summary, it also says thay i've made money. it's entirely false, is there a period of time that they are tracking these for that maybe would make more sense? like, do they start jan-15 to feb 15 or something? 

entirely confused, i hope it's just a lack of brain cells from me and i don't have to make a call.

"the customer service downfall of uber and uber eats the sustainability of uber's market position is increasingly in question due to persistent deficiencies in its customer service. the evident inadequacy of well-trained customer support personnel has led to a surge in complaints concerning service quality. customers have expressed dissatisfaction with the use of scripted or automated responses, which often fail to effectively address their concerns, resulting in a lack of satisfactory resolutions, empathy, and willingness to address customer grievances.



furthermore, uber's recent discontinuation of the drizly service, attributed to service failures, reflects a troubling pattern of indifferent customer care. the company's failure to prioritize customer satisfaction is apparent, potentially driving dissatisfied customers to consider alternative options such as doordash, grubhub, or lyft.



the decline in customer satisfaction stands in stark contrast to uber's previously lauded reputation approximately three years ago. the company's failure to adapt to evolving customer expectations has led to a noticeable deterioration in customer experience. moreover, the use of misleading promotional offers, which ultimately prove non-functional during the checkout process, has further eroded customer trust and confidence in the brand.",2024-09-21 00:52:20,20,22,Reddit,UberEats

how much money does the uber eats driver get. ,2024-09-20 23:38:44,1,5,Reddit,UberEats
"driver delivered order from wrong restaurant, obviously wrong name/order, no inconvenience credit?  we ended up with $23 worth of arby’s when we were supposed to get $80 worth of taco’s discounted with a bogo promo to like $55 with delivery fee.

name on arby’s order was definitely not mine. 

we tried calling the uber driver, but he couldn’t understand what we were saying due to language barrier. pretty sure he thought we had the wrong items, not that it was someone else’s order, likely on the same route. he said he was going to contact uber to handle it, but we called uber ourselves after 10 minutes. 

uber is giving us a full refund and we removed the tip, but the call support rep said we weren’t eligible for an additional credit for the inconvenience. 

we asked to escalate to a supervisor and after being on hold for 10 minutes, he said the supervisor is aware and will call us back (said he can’t add any credit because the system won’t let him) 

are we sol on an inconvenience credit for losing 1.5-2 hours we could have had dinner? 

should we expect a call back or should i start a chat through the app?

i can see them thinking that the arby’s order could constitute as a form of compensation (wasn’t mentioned by support), but it’s food we won’t eat due to an allergy.

"made 2 orders from the same place, only got given 1, but the delivery person re-used the pin for the 2nd order without giving it to us hi, 

(uk based for reference) it's a little complicated but as i've said in the title, made 2 separate orders from asda and the same person 'delivered' both (but only actually delivered 1).

  
this is the first order(s) for my husbands account. i have had an account for a long time but he got given a ""first order(s) voucher / promotion"" offer via email, so he made an account.

he made 2 separate orders for the same place (asda), both were shopped for, and said were being collected and being delivered by the same person.

the person arrived with arms full of bags and put them in our doorway and asked for the pin for the first order (all of the first order is correct). husband gave them the pin. 

husband told the person that there were 2 orders, thinking that they would then bring the second order. between both orders the amount of bags was too many for one person to carry at once.

they asked for his dob (only the second order should have needed that, so it was very obviously 2 separate orders, plus husband told them and we only have the bags for the first, not a mix from both, so it's not like they mixed the orders up, they only brought the first one).

we realised when they got in their car and drove off that we weren't being given the second order.

the delivery person must have re-used / remembered the same pin, and used it for the second order without his permission, and without giving husband his second order, they just drove away.

husband's phone pinged a notification for \*\*both\*\* orders, saying they were \*\*both\*\* delivered, but we only have the first one.

.

.

.

we tried ringing through to the delivery person in the ""help"" section, multiple times thinking that it was an accident or they forgot but they didn't answer. husband then tried to use the ""help"" section to say that order was not delivered but it keeps saying ""order completed. it looks as though you entered a pin that confirmed your order has been delivered and is complete. enjoy!""

the only options left is ""share feedback"" and ""continue"" which closes it.

.

.

.

we did the feedback thing, and kept trying and eventually it did let us send a request, so we explained everything we have here but within minutes we got a reply saying:  
  
""hi name,  
  
sorry to hear about your experience.  
  
we reviewed the details and can see that the delivery partner completed the order using the pin you shared with them.  
  
this indicates a successful handoff, and as a result you were charged for the order.  
  
thanks for understanding.""

.

.

.

what can he do to fix this? he has replied again explaining and is waiting for a reply. we do also have cctv which shows them delivering and then quickly going back to their car and driving off. as we look back on it now and look at what was ordered, it does clearly show them bringing not enough bags for both orders (should have been 2-3 bags more with the second order, but there's no way they could have carried that many at once). 

how is this okay?

how are they allowed to re-use the pin (i know its the same each time, its the end of the phone number, unlike other apps which use a separate pin per order).

should he have made the delivery person bring both orders before giving the pin? but how because they won't give the order without the pin and they couldn't have carried both at the same time?

it's not like husband could follow them to their car to get the second order?

because he was asked for his dob for the second order, without giving us that order, that is making us wonder if is possible that they planned to do this?

is it possible that they kept our second order on purpose, knowing that because they'd been to the property and been given the pin for the first order, they could use it for the second and get free food and we couldn't dispute it?

has anyone had this happen to them?

can we just never make 2 orders at the same time? the app even suggests you make a second order within x time to get free delivery etc which i have used on my account in the past and have had no issues, but that was with different stores.

a similar question about the bags; when there is too many bags to carry in one go, should the delivery person ask for the pin \*\*before\*\* going back for the rest? or do they have to bring all of the bags to the door \*\*before\*\* asking for the pin? what do we do if they ask for the pin before we have the whole order(s)?

"uber teen promo scam the september promotion where if you sign your team up for an ubereats team account, they end up getting six free rides and six free meals seems to be a scam. i signed my 17 year old son up he accepted we got the app installed on his phone, he's added to my account and no promo. he has no rides no meals nothing. the only promotion on his account is $5 off any order over $25. 

i've spent 3 days talking to customer support and they all tell me the same thing, that if there was a promotion available it would have shown up in his promotions and then they immediately shut me down by summarizing the chat and disconnecting immediately. i've been asked to be transferred to supervisor and been told no by five different reps, i've spoken to a total of nine reps, four of which were from their supposed specialized team that's supposed to fix issues like this. 

i also was supposed to get an email from the other specialized team that doesn't handle chat issues and takes 12 to 24 hours to reach out, and of course they never reached out. i've sent screenshots showing that they're advertising the promotion on their twitter account, on their instagram account, it's even being advertised on tiktok, and yet the promotion is not valid? like how am i supposed to get this fixed if every chat rep tells me that if it was a valid promotion it would already be on his account? if it's not a valid promotion it's illegal for them to advertise it as one because they're getting people to sign up under false pretense. is there anyone else i can contact at the company or does anybody else know how to fix this?",2024-09-19 18:07:39,9,10,Reddit,UberEats

"ubereats overcharges me a very small amount on nearly every order?  so part of the reason i noticed this is because i'm overly on top of my finances.  i use my credit card for points and almost always immediately pay off each individual purchase, unless i'm out and about. 

i'm sending payments to my credit card daily.  

when i order with ubereats or a delivery app, i always make the order total + tip an even number.   i don't know why, i just so.  a $23.70 order would get a $6.30 tip to make an even $30. 

so i always note the order total before moving to the tip screen, and adjust my tip accordingly.  

when i get the google pay notification though, it's always for a higher amount.   that $30 order hits my account as $30.51.   a $24 order hit my account as $25.88.  these amounts settle - they aren't just authorizations.  

obviously ubereats struggles to make any money.  i'm wondering if there is some technical issue or if this is them knowingly trying to make little bits of money and hoping people don't notice.  

separately, but kind of the same thing - 10 minutes ago i placed an order and added special instructions to a sandwich (add cheese).  there was no option when adding the item.   when i placed the order, i quickly got a notification that the restaurant had changed my order total ($29 originally).  viewed the receipt - an extra $2.99 for the special request + $0.39 additional tax.  

yet my order total is now $32.97.   not $32.38. 

i know these are tiny amounts, i'm just curious if anyone else has seen this?  support is obviously useless when i have brought it up with them.  ",2024-09-17 20:01:19,9,23,Reddit,UberEats

"uber eats order never arrived (uk) hi guys,

  
first time coming onto this subreddit, in a desperate attempt to find an answer. after reading other posts it does seem that this is quite a prominent issue. regardless hopefully i can get your advice/opinions.

  
myself and my partner made an order worth about £30 from a local restauraunt which we've ordered from multiple times before. after an hour, the order was marked as delivered on the app. we had not received a call or knock on the door. the meal was delivered to an address ten minutes walk away. we set out to go to the address to pick up the meal, upon arrival the owner of the property asked us ""if we had ordered food from uber eats"", we responded with ""yes"". she then proceeded to inform us, that the driver had taken a picture of the order by the door, then proceeded to take off with the order (she provided video evidence of him leaving with the order).

  
we've attempted to get a refund via the in app 'help' section, stating that the order had never arrived, but they keep informing us that the order is not eligible for a refund. i'm not sure if these are just automated responses or being reviewed by someone, as i believe we provided reasonable evidence to show it was never delivered (pictures of the houses being different, screenshot of call logs, screenshot of the delivery location). 

  
i've called directly but you're not allowed to speak to someone without a live order. i've spoken to their live chat on the website. i've raised multiple messages in the app. i've also messaged via twitter support, but to no avail.

is there any more steps a lamen individual like me can take to try and get this resolved?",2024-09-17 12:40:21,1,2,Reddit,UberEats
"reimbursement in orders that never arrived just a quick tip for yall since i've seen that there's alot of ppl struggling with refunds and support being non sense about it. there's a way to report a security issue as a costumer saying that the driver didn't match the account and you will get your reimbursement right away, the only thing you have to do is be aware when the driver is coming close to the drop off, if you see your order gets stolen, report security issue>driver doesn't match the account; that way that driver gets 1 strike to deactivation and you get your reimbursement, this is how we costumers can clean the system from those scammers.

"frustrated with ubereats so i live in france & i made an order on ubereats at one of my favourite restaurants. but i realised literally 2 seconds after my order was confirmed & accepted by the restaurant that my the delivery address was incorrect.

i tried to change it, but the app said i couldn’t modify the address because the order was already accepted so i cancelled my order immediately (a few seconds after the confirmation)… they refunded the service charge, but they still charged me 17€ for the food because apparently the restaurant had already started preparing it.

i contacted support to see if anything could be done and they said they couldn’t refund me because the food had already been prepared. they even claim they saw the time stamps of the order confirmation / cancellation and they said “we contacted the restaurant & brought this up and they said the order was already prepared.” really? they cook / throw it in the container that fast?

i know the initial error was my fault, but i’m just frustrated because the total time between the order confirmation and the order cancellation was roughly 6 seconds. also i had full intention of making a new order with the correct delivery address. so now i’m out 17€ and don’t even get any food.

i called the mcdonalds and spoke to the general manager, he was familiar with the order as it is early in the morning.  he informed me the ice cream machine was not even working and they informed the driver of this when he came there. he informed the driver there was nothing for them to give him for the order. he watched the driver personally mark on his phone that he had picked up the order and the driver walked out empty handed.

i tried to provide this information to uber eats but was met with the same response ""the order is ineligible for a refund"" and would not let me speak to a supervisor. 

can anyone here offer advice on what to do next?  this is the third time such an incident has occurred and my account is obviously now been blocked from receiving refunds. this is now an issue of theft, they have my money and i have nothing, again. how do i proceed? is there a secret number or email address where i can contact someone who's not reading a script or computer prompt to resolve this? do i actually need to send a letter to uber inc. legal? do i call the police and file a report?  do i need to go to my attorney and have a letter sent to uber inc legal? i'm sick of getting my money stolen from uber eats. i know they're counting on me to just give up, but i'm not going to do that.

p.s.  
i've tried doing a charge back before, but uber provided ""evidence"" to the debit card company that allowed them to win the charge back.  their evidence?  they had successfully delivered to my address before, therefore they were successful in the instance i was disputing. this flimsy obvious bs allowed them to win. so doing a charge back will result in nothing, and in fact because i lost cost me $100 from my bank.",2024-09-16 08:06:39,17,69,Reddit,UberEats

"just had the most awful uber eats delivery experience. 
i (31f) just ordered some food from uber eats, and i’m still baffled by what happened. i live in the netherlands and am disabled, so i ordered uber eats to have an easy meal due to a lack of energy. i ordered some french fries, snacks, a drink, and sauce. the delivery time came and went, and 30 minutes after the latest delivery time, i still didn’t have my food. when i called, the shop told me they had forgotten my order but would make it right away. it took them 30 more minutes to get here, so my order was an hour late. 

the delivery driver came to the door, and instead of handing me the food, he just put the box on the ground and demanded i open it myself to get the food out. he then started asking how much i was going to tip him.i told him i had put in an automatic tip of 15%, so he would get that much. he was standing in my entrance, demanding i tell him the exact amount. i opened my phone to show him it was around €3.50, and he started yelling that i needed to tip at least €5 and that i’d better change it. to get him out of my entrance so i could shut the door, i gave him the extra €1.50 in cash so he would leave. with me being disabled i’d rather give him the money then end up in a worse situation.

when i was finally safe inside, i looked at my delivery and noticed there was no usual uber eats sticker or anything to ensure the bag was sealed. it was just a plain plastic bag. i opened it and found, instead of my food, a sandwich bag filled with raw pizza dough. the drink was completely sticky with raw dough, and the sauce was in a separate bag but spilling out, so i had to throw that away too.

i called the restaurant, and they demanded i send a picture. they denied it was theirs until i showed them the receipt stapled to the bag. after much discussion, i demanded my money back and asked them to cancel the order, but they refused. the owner said he would send the order again. i agreed because i was hungry and didn’t think they could mess it up again—but i was wrong.

the same delivery driver came back, cursing under his breath, and demanded i hand over the first bag, which i did since i thought i was getting a whole new delivery like the owner said. however, when i opened the box again, the plastic bag with the food was open, and the bag of fries was also open, spilling into the box.i told the driver that it was open, so how could i know he hadn’t touched my food? plus, half of my fries were now loose in the delivery box. i also questioned how it was safe to eat from a food warming box that hadn’t been cleaned in ages, judging by its appearance. he started getting mad again, so i just took the food.

upon closer inspection, i saw that half of my order was missing. this time, it was the sauce and drink that were missing. the owner messaged me, asking why i sent back the drink and sauce. i explained that i wasn’t going to drink from a container covered in raw pizza dough or use sauce that was spilled in a bag. i demanded my money back again, and it took me half an hour before he finally refunded me. he kept offering to remake the food for free, but i refused.he then told me i’d have to take it up with uber eats, which was a lie because he could cancel the order anytime. uber eats was completely useless aswell; i could only message them from my country, and when they saw it was an ongoing delivery, they put me on hold for 8 hours while they redirected me to another department. i couldn’t even file a complaint since all i could do was request a refund.

honestly, i’m never ordering from this restaurant or using the app again. the hygiene of the restaurant was absolutely awful, and uber eats refused to help in any meaningful way. it seems like they just hope you’ll stay quiet if you get your money back.

now it's a few hours later, and this is what i see (screenshot  below). it's strange because it doesn't show the customer reduced the tip, and it doesn't show that they have 1 hour to change it either. i contacted support, and they assured me i will receive the fare within 3 business days. i'll believe it when i see it!

also, i tipped well, and i don't live that far. i know a lot of people assume the driver ate their food i want to give my driver the benefit of the doubt and maybe something happened where he was unable to come, i was just hungry and looking forward to my combo platter over rice lmaoo",2024-09-15 15:16:00,0,3,Reddit,UberEats

* a new driver was assigned after around 30 minutes
* order took around 90 minutes in total to get to me
* food was all room temperature on arrival (couldn't be described as remotely warm)
* this indicates the food was obviously sitting for what i assume is nearly an hour
* uber would only acknowledge the order took a long time and would only refund 25% of the sub total of the order, and would not acknowledge that the food i paid for went into the garbage can (this was ofc only possible in uber credits)

"ghost orders been getting so many ghost orders in my area. the algorithm that uber has is so broken. drivers report the food missing, base pay goes up to $35+. so last night i get a $37 order. knew something was up but i’ll try anyway. food had been stolen by another driver but it was $15 worth of food. the restaurant was luckily still taking orders, so i reordered the food & informed the customer as well as support. customer was so incredibly grateful & left additional $10 cash. support was useless and did not even offer to compensate me, whatever. but had i not resolved this issue, the customer would’ve been in an endless loop of “your driver is picking up your order” 


my question is why do they continue sending drivers and bumping up the base pay if the order was reported missing or the store was reported closed. my ratings are still getting fucked even though i barely cancel orders unless one of these scenarios happens. they  literally bait their drivers with these offers when they usually can’t be fulfilled.

"discount disappeared after placing the order so i’m having an issue with a recent order and could use some advice. i placed a grocery order using a 50% off promo for orders over $50, with a max discount of $40. my pre-authorized total was around $85. after two items were refunded and one was substituted for a cheaper alternative by the shopper, my final charge came out to $91.01.

the $40 discount completely disappeared from my final receipt!!

i don’t have a screenshot of the promotion (i didn’t think i’d need it!), but my pre-authorized total clearly reflected that discount. i’ve been going back and forth with chat support, and they keep saying they can’t help without a screenshot of the promo, which is super frustrating.

i even called and spoke to a rep on the phone, and he actually took the time to investigate the situation. he agreed that it looked like there was definitely a promotion applied to my original order, especially since the final amount charged was more than the pre-authorized total even though i had items “refunded” and cheaper substitutions. but, in the end, he still couldn’t do anything because he can’t find the promo in my account (probably because it was already used?) he said he would ask the supervisor to call me back but to be honest he thought the supervisor would just say the same thing- no refund without a screenshot.

i feel like i’m going in circles here. has anyone else had this happen? how do i get this escalated or resolved when i don’t have that screenshot but the initial charge clearly shows the discount?

uber eats is a scam 

edit to add: i almost never complain. only several times over many years when orders were actually messed up. in this case i provided substantial evidence and i know they themselves have substantial evidence i never got this delivery. so just… why? it’s baffling. i pay for uber one for years… not that it should matter!

"questions about bike delivery. i just switched my account over to bike delivery. and i have a few questions. 

when selecting vehicle type there are three options: walking, uber bicycle, and uber bicycle bicycle. after trying to find answers it seems like uber bicycle is an e-bike rental service offered by uber. so i am assuming the first bike option is for non e-bikes and the second bike option would be for e-bikes. i am wondering how each option affects the orders coming in. if i have my own personal e-bike does it matter which option i choose? or is one better than the other? what's the difference?

i tried going out for deliveries but i just sit there for a long time in between orders. i sit there for an hour at a hot spot. after completing the first order i get i then return to the hot spot and sit there for another hour before i see any order requests. the order requests are very few and far in between. i tried during the week and though it's just slow on weekdays but hopefully it will be busy on the weekend. so i went out friday during lunch hours and during dinner hours. and it was the same thing. i spent a good amount of time just sitting there waiting for orders. friday night there was a short time where i did get more orders and better paying orders but it was only a small one-ish hour window most of the night it was still pretty slow especially for a weekend night. and almost all of the orders i did get were less than 2 miles away from the restaurant, many of which were less than one mile. i think it's a good thing that i am getting low mileage orders while on bike. but i rather get 3 or 4 mile orders then no orders at all. i don't make any money if i don't complete any orders. i don't understand why i am not getting any orders even during busy hours. i am wondering if there is a limit in distance for the orders it will sends me. does it prioritize cars and send me the leftovers? with car delivery in the same area i would see a ton of orders all the time. of course most of those orders were not worth taking. and there would be a lot of $2-$4, 8+ mile orders, which they probably would not send to bike delivery. is there a way for me to set a mile limit on the orders i receive? is there a way to increase the amount of orders i receive? do customers have to select some bike option for it to get sent to bike delivery? will customers know that their order is being picked up by someone on a bike?

anything else i should know or consider? 

$5 to $7 an hour is not going to work for me. i don't have any money for a car. and my car is not worth repairing at this point. what i need is a job. but for the time being i am trying to make bike delivery work the best i can. ",2024-09-14 13:05:05,1,5,Reddit,UberEats

they buy milk on sale, but it's not in stock, so they still need milk and are forced to accept an upcharge for a product that wasn't on sale. 

imagine half your order is ""sale"" items and when your delivery arrives it's all ""full price"" items that were substituted because the store was ""out of original item"".

"new cancellation system!! i spent half of my day today with ubereats support about this issue. in a nutshell: since their last update there is a new cancellation system. **unless the order is cancelled by the customer or the restaurant, all orders cancelled by support for any reason out of our control go into your cancellation rate.**

i've had conversations with several agents, sometimes it was surreal. they don't read what you are replying, they don't make any effort to understand the issue, they repeat the same things over and over, educating me on how cancellations work and assuring me that my feedback is important to them :). most of them just disconnected from the chat though:) one agent, allegedly a supervisor, kept repeating that orders cancelled by support do not affect our cancel rate. i showed her a screenshot from my earlier conversation where i was told the complete opposite and she still kept repeating that she is giving me the correct information and then disconnected too.  
they all seem to be quite confused about this new policy, so i do think it's a big change even for them.

anyway, i ended up getting a more competent agent, also a supervisor, who told me he submitted an escalation ticket. whether it's true or not, we'll see.

for now, this is the situation we are in. i don't know who is responsible for this update and whether it was intentional or a mistake, but it's a major screw-up and it ultimately penalizes drivers and customers. customers get a cancellation fee if they cancel.

realistically, i doubt we can fight this if it was an intentional change, but we might be able to get uber to fix this if it was an error. i would suggest we systematically contact support, ask to be transferred to a supervisor, because entry-level agents are utterly useless, and we ask to submit/raise an escalation ticket. this is when technical team might get involved to look into the issue. maybe if we collectively complain about this issue, they will fix it.

in the meantime, we need to be more careful with the trips we accept. avoid accepting trips ""too good to be true"": most likely they are stolen/disappeared orders we'll end up cancelling. let uber deal with their screw-ups.

another loophole would be to try and order food listed in the order, pay with our own money, deliver to the customer and get the pay. makes sense if there is a big margin and might work with orders from cheap places.

"i almost got shot doing uber eats: the other night i accepted a 25$ order from mcdonalds on uber eats. it's was around 12:50am and it was slow that night but i managed to make 110$ so i thought that 25$ trip would be my closing trip for the night. 

  i saw the map before accepting the delivery and i didn't recognized the street but i did knew the surrounding neighborhoods since i've done deliveries to those areas before so i thought it would be safe and it wouldn't be a big of a deal.
so, i arrived at the restaurant and pick up the lady's order which consisted of 8 bags of mcdonalds party pack, happy meals, 3 mcflurry's and drinks. 

the note said ""leave at the door"", which was an inconvenience for me (since it was 8 bags) but i tried not give too much thought into it i just wanted to finish for the night.
when i drive to the main entrance i realized it's a building complex (which is hidden from the main road because is surrounded by trees) is blocked by debris, trash, rubble and discarded furniture, it was sketchy af. i tried calling the customer and telling her that i couldn't get inside due to the entrance's blockade and that she would have to come out somehow since it was too many bags, she refused, she told me to take another road from which i would get into the complex from the back.
oh boy.... i should've cancelled, when i got into the parking i realize it's a public housing complex, here in puerto rico we call them ""residenciales"" or ""caceríos"" which is the same as ""the projects"" in mainland united states. there were four cars l on with dark windows on with people inside those cars parked with their motor running, a community basketball court between the buildings and the parking, so for me, i had to walk through the basketball court with 8 bags to get into the building complex and find building #7. i said: ""hell no! i will not walk there no"" i knew it was dangerous for me to be there. i called the customer and told her that she needed to come where i was or i would leave the bags there and leave, she accepted and she told me that it would take her 5 minutes to get to where i was. i waited for about 15 minutes, nothing... 2 hooded guys came to my car from both the driver and the passenger side. one of them asked me ""why i was there"" i was scared, afraid for my life, the other guy was pointing me with a gun. he yelled a second time ""who i was looking for, what i was doing there!"" i said i was not there to cause any trouble, that i was just an uber eats driver doing a delivery for valerie (that's the name of the customer). he took my phone and saw that what i was saying was true and yelled at the other guy, ""hey, call valerie this stupid guy is ruining my business spot"" (sorry i'm translating from spanish the basic line cannot  be translated literally). she arrived with 4 kids and reluctantly took the bags and left. the hooded guy gave me back my phone and said that i shouldn't take what happened there seriously it was just a misunderstanding and he let me go. i got into my car and left as fast as i could.

it took me several days to digest what happened that night, i finally talked about it with my brother which is a lawyer and he told me he represented clients from that complex in the past even himself wouldn't dare to walk inside those housing projects. apparently, there was a drug war between gangs from that complex with neighboring public housing complex gangs and that days before there was a shooting with two deaths at that complex, he said that i was lucky to be alive since they don't usually speak before shooting to an unknown person inside their territory. i am afraid to do uber eats or doordash after this...",2024-09-12 00:13:26,67,75,Reddit,UberEats

five days ago, i decided to try priority delivery since it says it would come directly to me instead of me being the 2nd or 3rd stop on the driver’s route. however, i’ve had 3 priority deliveries canceled in the last 4 days. what seems to happen is that the order gets reassigned to multiple drivers until it’s past the delivery window, and then it just gets canceled.

i’m curious if anyone else has had similar experiences or if any drivers could explain why this might be happening. i'm not upset—just genuinely curious. for context, i’ve worked in the service industry, so i understand the challenges and always try to be polite. i also tip 25%.",2024-09-11 19:05:00,2,37,Reddit,UberEats

there are signs all over the place that state bicycles are not allowed on the train unless they are folded and stored in the luggage racks. i've seen several bicycle couriers and e-bike couriers using the train and it's clearly obstructing passengers travelling to work or the airport. recently, this has gotten out of control. people can't even move their luggage past these massive bikes, most of which have an uber eats (or another food delivery service) bag attached to the back.

"i can't figure out why uber eats [specifically] can't find my apartment. at my address there are two buildings. there is a north building and a south building. i use all caps because every sign has it just like that in all caps so no one is confused. no matter what i do, uber eats always drops my food at the wrong building. door dash does it fine as does domino's and local restaurants. when i order an uber for a ride, the driver is always parked outside the right building when i come downstairs. no confusion. uber eats however is a different story. here are my delivery instructions. i am tearing my hair out trying to figure out how i could be more clear. 

text: south building. one on left if you are facing them. drop in lobby okay, it is unlocked. 

pin: the pin is dropped on the south building directly in front where the loading zone and guest parking are. if your gps takes you to the other one, it's way off. i tested it myself in google maps. 

pic 1: picture of the approach to the building. the approach to both looks different. 

pic 2: picture of the door you need to open to get to the lobby. a lot of drivers after identifying the correct building give up and just leave the bag in the driveway or the back parking lot instead of going into the main entrance in the front of the building. 

pic 3: picture of lobby where there is a sign that says ""south building, drop off deliveries here"" 

pic 4: picture of google maps printout where i drew a red x over the north building and green circle the south building. i wrote the labels on as well. 

yesterday, i ordered some food and looked out the window when uber told me to ""wait a moment☝️"" while he dropped it off. the guy walks around the courtyard staring at both buildings. he looks at his phone. he walked over to my building and when he got close to the door he stopped dead in his tracks like he heard someone yelling at him. he looks at his phone for like 20 seconds, squints at the building, double takes to the phone, then turns around and goes straight over to north to drop off my food. he was literally right there and was looking at the phone! 

how do i get through to them? why is it always on this platform specifically? i even thought to take the outdoor pictures at night because it's usually night when they are delivering. i have half a mind to sign up for a driver account to try and deliver my own order just to see what's on the other screen that makes people want to even consider the other building.",2024-09-08 08:11:03,0,14,Reddit,UberEats

"sad saturday... today, i delivered 21 orders. i was offered well over 100 more... but i had my thumb over the ""x"" button to decline them.

why?

of those i ignored, 20 or more would have instantly *sucked* me into the heart of downtown chicago's hellscape black hole of paid parking, $75 parking tickets for every 90 seconds with your flashers blinking, and incessant chaotic in-city drivers.

of those remaining, not even one of them offered more than 50 cents per mile. most barely offered 30 cents per mile. gas may have fallen to $3.50 a gallon, from $4.79 a gallon, and i may be driving a prius, but i had to replace my brakes, my tires, my windshield, and now a headlight is out... i'm still in the red by over $1500 on maintenance, *not including* fuel.

so when i see those offers to drive at a loss, i now instantly tap the ""x"".

then i had a pizza delivery that i literally took my time driving to the restaurant for... i know most pizza places take 5-10 min to prep and bake the pie, but... when i arrived, they were literally just stretching the dough and said 20-30 mins. i insta-cancelled. no fkn way am i sitting for half an hour in a no-name pizza place for a $4 delivery going 2 miles.

it was a sad saturday in that i was almost sideswiped 6 times, ended up driving more than 160 miles over 6 hours, my passenger headlight died, then i returned home with less than $130 including tips. could i have made more? yeah. but the loss is not worth it to me.",2024-09-07 19:35:41,30,25,Reddit,UberEats
"question for seattle drivers ok all my seattle peeps, i have a genuine question for ya. does anyone know exactly how our local ordinances protect us? this is in regards to three things; the cancellation rate (being punitively punished by uber aka increasing our cr % for orders cancelled by a uber support staff), not being paid for a cancelled order even if the order was cancelled on ubers support end, and finally when a order begins in seattle but ends outside of seattle what is the compensation supposed to be (trips that begin in seattle but end outside the city don’t show up in our daily earnings report and this seems really suspicious to me)? 

i am curious on your guys knowledge of our local ordinance or just your interpretation of it. i have personally had it with shady actions on ubers part and am currently waiting for a local law firm to review my case in hopes of starting a class action against the overlords that be. doubt anything will come of it but still curious on your guys thoughts and experiences.

"uber fleet partners.. scams..  so it's come to my attention uber eats in poland requires you to either open your own business or sign up with a fleet partner. the partner sends you the money, and essentially they are full of lies and illegal activity.

it is amazing uber eats allows this, and if you message uber eats they will tell you to take it up with your fleet partner.

a fleet partner is suppose to be your employer. a work contract is required by law in poland. they manipulate the user, which is usually a foreigner into signing a bicycle rental agreement, which has nothing to do with a work contract. it is simply a loophole for them to have to pay less % of tax, thus the driver is able to receive more money. the rental, is actually them renting the bicycle from us..

after you sign it and they approve it, you will receive a dubious e-mail about how they work contract has been signed. this however is completely false, they only tell you will receive a contract to lure you in..

because with the contract comes a legal pathway to a work permit and then national health insurance. you see, if you have private insurance in poland, it is essentially covering doctor visits, not an accident where you break your arm and need a hospital visit. any life threatening issues are free to everyone, citizen or not.. however, the rest is not.

their advertisements about hiring couriers usually proudly display they will help you with your residence card, they will sign a work contract, and get you on the national health insurance. they will even say it to your face.

these fleet partners are very often ran by foreigners, or more or less. a polish person usually at the top with a dozen ukrainian, azerbaijani, or turkish people working on the sidelines. they always have english, ukrainian, russian, polish languages services, and i have even seen azerbaijani and turkish services.

everything about their behavior is disgusting, illegal, and uber is not only allowing it -- but promoting it.

as for my part, i'll do what i can. i have a life to live, but maybe a youtube video about the illegal and hideous activities needs to be uploaded.",2024-09-07 10:21:29,2,2,Reddit,UberEats

about 2 weeks ago , i order food on the app, a few moments later some person sends me a message on the uber eats app asking me for my postcode (i don't know how it works on the drivers end but from my pov he had not accepted the order).
i tell him my address, he rejects the order.
someone else accepts it, around 40 minutes later he brings me the food , he came on his bike.

his bike was stolen right in front of us as he was about to give me the bag. we didn't see a motorbike, but the guy who stole it was wearing a yellow motorbike helmet and we did hear one speeding off. poor guy , i felt so bad for him. my neighbours got out as he made some noise throwing the food around (understandably so), and thought he must have been followed by that motorbike.

today i ve ordered again, and had the same thing: someone called and asked for my address but this time i felt it was a bit suspicious so i didn't give him any details about my address. he rejected the order. it was later picked up by another person who didn't ask for anything and it all went well.

so i m posting here to ask this, is there a point in calling/messaging and asking for the address before accepting the order? should i be telling people my address before they accept to deliver it?
cause for a bike thief , that's a perfect set up really isn't it? takes address, goes with motorbike around the corner, waits for uber driver and steals the bike.

"ubereats no refund policy sets a potentially dangerous precedent let me start by saying that this has nothing to do with ue delivery drivers, as i have generally had very good experiences with 99% of them. 

to get to the point, i spent $50 on an order from taco bell, through ue, this past weekend. $30 of that was spent on 4 cheese quesadillas with extra creamy jalapeño sauce. 

unfortunately, i had to wait 1.5 hours for the delivery. however, i really don't have a huge issue with waiting, if i eventually receive my order.

in this case, the delivery driver went well out of his way to ensure that i eventually received my order, by waiting for 20-30 minutes, where the 2-3 previous drivers wouldn't. needless to say, i let him keep his tip, as he clearly earned it.

the problem arose when i finally received my order, only to find that the wrong sauce was used, as i now had 4 cheese quesadillas with extra chipotle sauce. sadly, they just ended up in the trash, because nobody wanted to eat them.

as a result, i figured that i'd at least get that $30 refunded in uber cash, which i could use toward my next order. after taking the time to thoroughly document the issue, with photos, uber had the balls to refund me a total of $2 in uber cash. that doesn't even cover the time i spent filling out the refund form.

after all, had i gone to taco bell myself, i could have gotten a refund or at the very least, they would have remade my food. ue doesn't even give you that option. 

this makes it abundantly clear that ue has absolutely no respect for their customers. worse yet, ue is essentially punishing the customers, by holding them responsible for mistakes made by the restaurants.

this sets a potentially dangerous precedent, as the restaurants now have zero incentive to care about ue orders, since ue clearly isn't going to hold them responsible for their mistakes.",2024-09-05 21:30:12,85,98,Reddit,UberEats

"is it common practice to not knock for ""meet at door?"" had a delivery tonight. i always mark as ""meet at door"" so that the food doesn't get set down where the raccoons might nab it faster than i can. tonight, the courier texted me ""i'm here."" usually when they message that, it takes them a minute to actually make it up the stairs and find my apartment. nonetheless, i was at my door a minute later and was worried because they messaged again ""i'm here"" but they didn't knock. i got to my door to find it had just been left there. no knock, no waiting to meet me, nothing. at least i beat those poor raccoons. is that on me? is it common knowledge that a no-knock text suffices as notice that they've arrived? i'm not gonna leave a bad review because it's not a big deal or anything, but i'm a little peeved.

editing to add: it seems the general consensus is that yes, it is common practice for ubereats drivers to just send a text. i guess my problem is that if the customer selected ""meet at door,"" you need to give the customer a minute to get to the door. a lot of these comments are saying that they neither knock nor wait for the door to be answered, and i personally find that a bit ridiculous, but from now on i suppose i will have to put ""please knock and do not leave food"" in the notes. because otherwise, i guess i can expect my food to be abandoned to the mercy of the raccoons. they're so chubby that they'd be adorable if they weren't so annoying.",2024-09-05 21:04:50,6,44,Reddit,UberEats

"ubereats x costco promotion not applied ordered a delivery from ubereats with a 20% off promotion on a minimum order of $90 from costco. the subtotal when i ordered was $95.34, and the promotion was then applied to give an order total of $96.98 (since fees and tip are applied after the promotion.)

however after delivery i was charged $118.41 because my 'order didn't meet the minimum purchase'. however my receipt shows that the subtotal is $92.58, it changed due to pricing being different based on product weights. fine, but i still come over the $90 minimum however uber refuses this and will not prove to me that i did not surpass the $90 limit. i have all the receipts and support conversations screenshots as well as a screenshot of the applied promotion. support has been so useless, they just send me the receipt again saying my subtotal was only $86, when i can clearly see its $92, and then they forcibly close the chat!

all the bar shows me is how many km and minutes to the restaurant, all other info is hidden. the only way i can ""decline"" this order is to let the timer go all the way down.. which means i have to hold my volume down button the whole alarm.

"treated as an ue driver? so this happened to me yesterday. it took me a while but i think i now know why. i ordered food from a nearby sandwich shop. it's within walking distance. i placed my order online and tipped. i marked for pickup and after placing the order it said my sandwich would be ready in 25 minutes. cool. so i walked over to the grocery store first to grab a bag of chips and a soda to go with my sandwich. you see, the grocery store is a few doors down from the sandwich place- why pay more for smaller quantities at the sandwich shop, right? i get my chips and drink, put it in my bag and walk over to the sandwich shop. i walk in and the person working asks my name. i tell them and they say, ""just gonna be another minute, you can wait here."" ok no problem, i'm about 3 minutes early so i take a seat. i then watch another dozen or so people come in and order sandwiches. the person behind the counter takes my hot sandwich and places it on the cutting board. they then proceed to help the other dozen or so people while my sandwich returns to a room temperature (so much for toasting it). the person then finally finishes my sandwich 20 minutes after it was ""ready"". they put their ""safety seal"" tape/stickers on the bag and hand it to me. i'm not a karen so i just take the sandwich and leave. all the while thinking, ""that was rude, 40+ minutes to make 1 sandwich and even made me wait while i was there."" that's when it dawned on me, did they think i was an ue driver and is that why they delayed/ignored my order for so long? did they see my grocery bag and assume i was a food delivery person? i've been to plenty of places where i see negative interactions between the restaurant and the delivery folks.

i get my order delivered, open up the bag, see burgers but no fries. the seal on the bag seemed fine so i know that the restaurant forgot to add the fries.

i go on the uber eats app and ask for a refund on my missing item and attach the photo of the order (sent it 4 times)

they reviewed the order and say unable to give me a refund. lol wtf?

so i call up the restaurant and tell them that they forgot to pack the fries. they offer pick up or putting in a second order but obviously i don't want that. but at least the restaurant knows that they forgot to pack the fries.

i call uber eats support line and explain to them exactly what happened. i tell the support person to call the restaurant right f'ing now and they'll tell you that the fries were not packed. and ubereats can refund me right away right? easy peasy? nope.

the support guy is like there's a process (lmao) i'm like what process dude just call the restaurant and check right now. it took me a minute to do that myself. then the guy is like no i have to follow the process \* eyeroll \*

i asked to have their manager call me back today so i can deal with this issue. obviously, no call back. at this point, i'm wondering if it's even worth making the international calls to uber (calling out of canada), and being put on hold, all for not even $5.

long story short, i got my refund but it took me about an hour and half of my long weekend.

by the way, i order ubereats about 5 times a week. i've been a customer for years. i spend so much money on this app it's not even funny. and yet they can't even process a simple $5 refund for missing fries when there's all the proof they need. what a f'king joke of a company and service.

loyalty doesn't mean jack shet to them and clearly, spending a thousand dollars a month isn't good enough to qualify for an automatic refund on $5 fries.

"id request - no alcohol ordered i had an order from a grocery store that was all basic stuff for a kid on a college campus. milk, cheese, a notebook, bread. no alcohol or id required non-alcoholic beverages. however, i still had to ""check for sobriety"" which involves me scanning their id. i space the scanning process until i'm about to leave (i'm new to the processes, still green), but they already entered their dorm. thankfully, i get them back downstairs, but i scan their id, knowing full well they were under 21, but i didn't care because there was nothing in their cart requiring an id anyway. now i'm told to return the items. issue is, it was already in their dorm and no way of recovering safely. i had to get the order canceled.

"why does nobody read delivery instructions?? i’m honestly so fed up… i live in an apartment building and i selected ‘meet at door’ but drivers still keep waiting for me at the entrance of the building. moreover, they wait at the wrong entrance - no idea why they go to the back door, which is closed after 21:30 every day so even if i wanted to, i couldn’t open the door for them at the back entrance… it is true that my flat is located near the back door and probably they use gps to find me but i made it clear in the delivery instructions (even attached a photo) that i want them to enter through the front door, which is exactly the delivery address i used with my order.

what am i doing wrong? i can’t believe that drivers are genuinely so incompetent…

"the worst experience of my entire life. 
so.

it all started when i made an uber eats order, pizza, and some discounted donuts from a second place because it was on the way. it was supposed to arrive at around 8:40pm and i was fine with that. the driver did not arrive at the restaurant until 8:50, and i didn’t get my food until 9:20 at which point it was ice cold. i immediately reached out for support, and i got a nice guy who offered my 20% off both orders, and said it would either be applied immediately or banked as uber cash, either way i was happy (id like to take now to say ive been an uber one member for 2 years and have never had an issue except once) this was until the next day when i ordered some chinese food. before it let me place the order, it said i owed from yesterdays order that had gone unpaid, and asked which card i wanted to use to resolve the dispute. confused and irritated i reached back out to uber (only over chat, there phone office was closed) and after 4 hours and 7 different people i was unable to resolve the issue, understand where my money/discount/uber cash was, and when i would be receive the money i had paid again for a fully paid and discounted order back in my account. no one resolved it. so today i called the actual phone number, and after multiple more hours on the phone i was unable to speak to a manager, supervisor, or specialist verbally to communicate and resolve my issue, i was placed on hold so many times and hung up on so many times i even tried calling as a reporter working on an article who wanted to speak with the operations manager at the facility (apparently the managers bosses, i learned this from one of the representatives) after all of this i finally resigned to just end attempting to resolve this with the company. they didn’t even have the decency to transfer me to someone outside of their department to file a complaint about their department. and so i cancelled my uber one membership and will be filing a small claims lawsuit to get my money back, as the company is so unwilling to try and resolve this. this is what happens when you piss off an autistic boy in law school. i just wanted to rant somewhere i wouldn’t be hung up on. and im a little curious if something like this have ever happened to someone else.

"anyone else have any experience with lying delivery drivers?  had a big order placed yesterday(tip included) and delivery was made at a wrong address. when i called the delivery person immediately started gaslighting, saying he will cut the line because he doesn't find me polite (just told him he dropped off at the wrong location at the time), kept telling me confidently about the address the app showed him (not my house) and how it was a corner plot (i don't live in a corner plot). kept insisting he called and texted (did nothing but send a simple ""i've arrived"") and because i didn't respond he can leave it wherever. he then claimed to have screenshots and when i asked to send those, he checked his phone and immediately hung up. funnily enough, i've had two deliveries before and after that that exact day without toggling anything with my address and they were normally left at my door. 

i've also done plenty of deliveries on my own and know fully when how the app works on the driver's side. if you use a different map instead of the uber one, it'll take you to the area but not necessarily to the exact doorstep of your drop-off point and may mix-up the address so naturally you're supposed to have the common sense to double check the address on the driver's app. thankfully was fully refunded but as someone who's done this job myself, it doesn't hurt to be more responsible and not play the victim after making a mistake.

"9 cent tip and a bonus penny later! plus trying to help someone stranded.. dear uber eats dairy, 

today i pickup and delivered a $9 order for mcd's - i was right next to it and drop off was only a couple miles.  didn't bother to check earnings breakdown until the end of the night and the dude left a 9 cent tip - he didn't reduce it...i guess it was late and the base rate was higher than normal. 

not really complaining because of that, but who leaves a nine cent tip when you order in the app?  he did have a smug ass look in his face so idk maybe some ""mwahaha dumb lowly biatch, not even a dime!"" internal vibes (??).

later i had a nice interaction with a customer and she was all smiles after handing off her food, and after the tip cleared i was notified that i was given more than the initial tip amount by a whole penny!  i'm guessing she may have forgot to put in a couple zero's but who knows.

on the road back home i saw a guy with his hazards on on the side of the road, sitting down and looking despondent.  i told myself i'm going to do a circle around a few streets and if i don't get pinged i'm going to see if i can help him. 

no pings, so i go back and pull up behind him - he comes over with a smile on his face and asks if he can call his mom because he locked his phone in the car.  ""you locked your car while you got out after putting on the hazards?"". ""yeah it was stupid of me, can i call my mom on your phone?""

i let him and it goes to voicemail.  this guy looks totally harmless, half my age and it's hot af so i offer him a ride to his mom's.  he thinks about it and says that would be great..then he sorta half nods off and says that it's actually okay because she's on her way.   i then notice the stains running down the front of his shirt as the wind carries a strong stench of vomit.

i quickly realized this guy was day drinking somewhere close and threw up all over himself, pulled over because he realized he's all f'd up then drunkenly locked himself out of his own car. 

""so you're okay then, your mom's coming?""

""yup!""

""ok good luck!""

and then i drove off. 

i was back down the same highway 2hrs later and he was still sitting outside of his idling car.  honestly surprised a cop didn't show up by then.  oh well. ",2024-09-02 10:28:11,7,3,Reddit,UberEats
"how can ubereats manage to suck at each order? long story short, i've used ubereats only three times. and only once the order came right. 

1. they have added some promo that is not validated by restaurant. which made us discuss with restaurant and i have returned the order. i've spent 3 days to figure out that mistake was on ubereats. 

2. i have ordered from same restaurant. but actually i called them on the phone to tell my order since ubereats failed at first order, and customer service replies to you 6 hours later. 

3. i have entered my address and everything correct, but my address has changed and order went to a different branch in different city. and there is no phone number you can call, the section on their webpage leads to an blank page, and there is no customer service to help you. i've tried maybe 4 times on chat and each of them ""forwards your request to another branch"", which will reply in 6 to 12 hours. like what is the point of food delivery if you are going to reply in 6 to 12 hours... i called the restaurant to tell them there was a mistake and restaurant  told me these kind of mistakes happen with ubereats very often.

"can you mark delivered if you don't leave the food? hello, honest question. i ordered some food, and apparently the driver tried to contact me. i saw a call that was marked as spam so i didn't answer, i think that was them. after a while i checked again and it said delivered but had a black screen as the photo so i couldnt see where. i walked around to the location listed on the map and all over my apartment complex, but i didn't see the food anywhere. i checked some hiding spots but it was all empty. i tried calling them a few times but got no answer. 

i asked support and they gave me a full refund, but they didn't really clarify the policy on marking things as delivered. 

i feel bad because they refunded me including the tip. i asked if i could have them keep the tip but they said they couldn't edit it? i feel really bad, i dont want them not to get paid, i just wish they had left the food. 

does the black screen mean the food was not delivered? can you still mark it as delivered if you didn't really leave the food? if they had taken a photo so i could find it i wouldn't have contacted support at all and just taken some luke warm food as my punishment for missing the call since that was my fault. why do people do the black screen? 

edit: the calls have not been marked as spam before and i get pretty regular spam calls in general. i'll answer them if i order again though now that i know. ",2024-09-02 04:23:50,0,32,Reddit,UberEats

i check my backround and it says completed its all clear even my driving record. but checkr tells me that they have verified my social security number but need uber to send my ssn card (picture) to further verify my social. so im like ok thats pretty standard.

so i go to uber and they tell me they cant. that there is a discrepency and i need to contact checkr about. but they wont tell me what the discrepency is. nor can i fix it. alli know is that one party is trying to verify my ssn and the other wont send it off. i was litearly told that i can not fix my account. uber told me that my ssn is different from the one i used? and im like hmm? how. if your verification process is so rigorous if i miss inputed a number how would u even verify me in the first place? so i asked if i can change or check it. and they told me they do not have the ability to do that. so who has? god? like ur support? wdym??!",2024-08-31 14:12:26,2,2,Reddit,UberEats

"is this normal for uber eats? just had a really weird experience with uber eats where i think the driver may have been trying to lure me out of my house. i could be being overly vigilant, this has creeped me out though.

been on a staff do tonight so i fancied some food when i got in. decided to order pizza hut from uber eats. at 2am i get a call from our delivery driver stating that he's stuck a few streets away because he's out of petrol and absolutely will not be able to get home to the next town over unless i come meet him to get my pizza.

the guy's manner was completely off. he sounded very frantic and didn't make a huge amount of sense (who sets out to make uber deliveries with no petrol?). when i said no because i'm not walking streets away to meet any strange men at 2am he claimed the gps was unable to find my address, and when i didn't accept this he claimed he was new and didn't know the area or how to get home. i told him to use google maps and he hung up. he was then at my door within seconds, heralded by a revving engine.

my boyfriend wound up going to the door because the call was strange and neither of us was comfortable and he said the guy was very erratic, kept trying to poke his head around and kept looking off to the side as though he were looking for someone. he tried to hold my boyfriend at the door to ask for directions to the next town over and to the petrol station. my boyfriend got the creeps and wound up telling him he didn't have a clue and we locked up. he said he felt like the guy was stalling through the interaction.

look, i could be making something out of nothing but there were a few red flags here that made me super uncomfortable. if i were an uber driver i know there's no chance i'd be accepting deliveries if i had no petrol. i also find it kind of weird that he didn't know how to get back from my town to his town given he both lives there and had delivered our food from a shop there...and he had gps. i'm not 100% on uber's policies but i'm sure it has to be contra to them to request the customer meet the driver at a location several streets away in the middle of the night, least of all if the customer is a lone woman?",2024-08-30 22:24:30,3,4,Reddit,UberEats

"let’s b* about the customers main complaint: customer who set pin required or choose meet at door but is not responding when u arrive. and put their phone on do not disturb mode. and put their wrong address and when realizing tell you they don’t know how to change address in the app (come on u be a little more tech savvy ok?)

anyway i delivered an order today. it’s pin required. meet at lobby. and the note said “name( a different name from the order name) will meet you at the lobby. 

i arrived. it was a high rise office building. i first tried the receptionist and told him both of the names and was advised that i need to contact the customer directly and they will come down to pick it up. 

i then sent message telling them i arrived and then called them. called him at least 3-4 times no pickup. about fifth time i called him he finally answered and told me that there should be a number listed in the app to contact the person with the other name who’s gonna meet me at the lobby. i said no. there’s no number in the note or anywhere. i asked him to give me the number. i then called that number, the lady then answered me lazily. saying that she’s coming down. i waited her for almost 10 minutes for her to show up. at this point uber actually already gave me an option to just leave the food at a safe place and leave. well i chose not to do that because that just gonna stir sh*t up more. the lady finally showed up and i asked for the pin. she gave it to me and i handed her the food. i then left but later received a call from the person who ordered saying that the order is wrong. i said. i checked the name when i picked up it’s correct. he then sent me a photo of the order i said this is not the order i gave to the lady. he then checked with the lady and eventually said that everything’s fine there’s a mix up or whatever. and all of these has wasted me so much time. 

customers:

1. if you place an order that’s pin required or meet at door. then do not put your phone on do not disturb. be considerate and answer the phone or the door knock. these are basic etiquette coz our time matters.

2. if you send someone else to pick up your order please make sure that that person is smart enough to differentiate different order literally smh and roll my eyes.

3. if you put in the wrong address then change address in the app so that uber can recalculate the fee to us. do not act like a child and call us when we are driving and biking whining about the address that you put in is wrong. if you know how to place an order you know how to change an address. open your order detail page and figure out how to do it. i mean a lot of you are doctors, lawyers or even software engineers how hard can it be? or if you really can’t contact the uber customer service agent to do it.

"app has me paying twice for tips hey guys. so there’s a weird thing going on and i just want to know if i’m the only one experiencing it. i noticed that when i order from uber eats, after i checkout my order, the money is taken out of my account (total + tips). however, when the order is completed, either the same day or the next day, i get a notification from the app saying that i need to complete another payment for the tip amount? but they already took the money out so i’m not understanding why i need to pay again?

here’s an example to put it into perspective: lets say i order food from a restaurant and the total comes up to $30 flat. i add $8 as a tip for the driver so when i checkout, $38 is taken from my account (i use paypal usually).

so everything is fine and dandy. the order is completed and i enjoy my food. then i get a notification that i have to pay $8 and that uber was unable to take it from my account (i usually only put enough to cover the order). but i already included the tip with the total? so basically they want me to pay an extra tip?

right after placing i the order, i saw the location was much further than i thought. (i had mixed it up with another similar resteraunt much closer) in less than 2 mins, we decided to cancel. he told me there was no warning that we would still be charged when he canceled, but after we did not get a refund because ""they had already started on our order."" i later learned that some places auto accept, and that's what happened. 

we called the resteraunt and asked if our order came through, and since we were charged, we would rather just pick it up than waste our money. they had not started on the order or had any records of it even coming in. uber refused to refund us nearly $40  for no service, no product on my end, and no product wasted by the resteraunt. i just filed a charge back with capital one, who i've had great experience with as far as customer service. but they told me it would be up to 90 days before a conclusion is reached.

"update for getting payment on uber $200m settlement over its ipo scandal hey guys, i posted about the settlement already, but in case you missed it, i decided to post it again. it’s about the scandal uber had over its ipo — and the good news is that they just recently decided to pay $200m to resolve it. 



for the newbies: back in 2020, uber increased subsidies for drivers and meals during its ipo, which also increased expenses for sales and marketing. moreover, they were also planning to cut the costs and turned out that it could have influenced the overall growth. 



so, after all this news, their stock dropped (obviously) and investors sued them afterwards. 



on the bright side, they just recently decided to pay a $200m settlement to all damaged investors to resolve this scandal. so, if you bought it back then, you can check the details and [file for the payment here](https://11thestate.com/cases/uber-investor-settlement).



anyway, another day another scandal for uber. tbh i am not surprised by the scandal, but surprised that they decided to pay over this (well, at least something). were some of you investors back then? or how much did you lose on uber overall at this point?

i have several questions:

1) is this a new (or old) scam on the customer side? fake tips, multiple orders, something like that?

i don’t have a sore waist. i just didn’t wanna get attacked 🫣

"how to delete uber account and resubmit application for ubereats (uk, due to error in submission.)  hi,

i tried to sign up for uber eats to deliver food a couple of years ago. it required me to go into the post office and present my passport after entering the details online. however i made a small error when submitting the details (put the expiry date with one number on it wrong.) so they were unable to confirm it for me at the post office.

i am trying to sign up again now. i have a new uk passport as of two weeks ago, but my account still remembers the first attempt and won’t allow me to start again.

i wish to delete my uber account and start a new one with the same mobile number so i can try again with my new passport. 

tried deleting my account but it says it has been done but that i can log back in at any time to get all my old information back. which is exactly what i don’t want of course, i wish to start completely from scratch.

anyone know if there is anything i can do?

"delivery driver held my food hostage - story in retrospect this story is funny, it happened a couple weeks ago but just came to mind today, enjoy.

the popeyes by my house has that sandwich and wings bundle going on: 2 sandwiches, an order of wings, a side and a drink all for ~$25 bucks whatever it’s a pretty good deal when i’m eating w/ my boyfriend. it’s 7pm, dinner rush is here so i tip a flat $10 which is about 30% of the total.
it’s a lot of tip but i used to work in food so i get it can get stressful, and it makes me feel good it’s a small way to give back. i have a heavy practice of tipping more when the delivery is successful since i have social anxiety and prefer contactless.  

at around 7:10pm i get a notification that our order was picked up by a delivery driver. shamefully we order uber pretty often and usually get the same drivers, i noticed this ud did not have any kind of ranking and joined in august ‘24. i didn’t pay it mind until the driver send me this message verbatim: “the food is taking too long…”

haha what? i send a courtesy message thanking her for waiting for the food and get back to what i was doing, about five minutes later i get a long paragraph about the driver’s time being wasted, how they don’t have all night to wait on the order, what do i have to say about that? i didn’t have much to say so i didn’t respond. not too long later the order gets marked as on the way, so the driver would up waiting ~ 20 minutes total for the order assuming he was there before taking it up in the app. 

the store is only about a ten minute drive away so at 7:45pm i realize the driver must be stuck in traffic and i check the app, it shows they’re outside. five minutes later, still outside. i go outside and the driver is pulled in my driveway with the window down. i walk up to her car and immediately she starts saying i changed the address halfway through her drive to mess her up (what? idk) and that the order took too long to make. i apologize again to her and simple state that i expected it to be busy because of the time. she proceeds to say she’s lost money waiting for the order, demands i pay her more money to get my order. i refuse to give her any more money and warn her that i know what she’s trying to do, i will report her if she doesn’t give me my food. she starts to pull away saying that she’s taking the food back to the store. i couldn’t help but laugh and watch her pull out of the driveway just to park on the street and stare expectantly. 

after i went inside i reported the delivery driver and reordered. uber eats really needs to update their help site to include an option for food being held hostage by delivery driver, the only way i could report the behavior was to find out which support channel worked best for the situation. 

then finally, at 8:10pm, i got a notification that the first ud has delivered my food with a picture. i don’t know what the plan was, i assume after an hour a late order that is contactless and your sitting outside of doesn’t look good for your score. the bizarreness of the experience left me swearing off uber eats for good lol, that was the third time something crazy happened with a driver in the years i’ve used uber but i’m pretty sick of it.

"any way to put my money to any sort of use? i recently made an uber eats account, and i put a $40 gift card onto it to use. earlier today i tried to place an order and it asked me for my id. i am 16, so when i uploaded a picture of my id the app told me i couldn’t do anything because i’m under 18. does this mean my money is stuck in the account forever? i have a few questions about how i can put the money to use if that’s possible. i’m completely new to uber/uber eats, so i really don’t have any idea how it works. i looked around the uber eats app, and i have some questions of possible solutions i couldn’t find much information on.

can i turn my account into a teen account? i didn’t see any option to turn my account into a teen account, but i know that teen accounts are a thing. this is what i would like to do the most, out of all my questions. it says that teen accounts have to be invited by a guardian account, but if i made an account that wasn’t invited by a guardian originally, can i make it into a teen account and give it a guardian? my dad has an uber account, can he become the guardian of my account and i can become a teen account? or is that not a thing, and there’s no hope for being a teen account if you weren’t one to begin with?

is there a way to switch my id? i only put in my id because it asked me to verify, and i can’t find an option anywhere on the app to remove my id, or put in a new id. is that a thing i can do?

can i transfer the money to a different account? it’s $40 that i don’t want to go to waste, so if there’s truly no way for me to use it, can i at least transfer it to someone else’s uber account so they can use it?

are any of these options possible? if not, is there any other way to put the money to use? it’s $40, i don’t want it sitting in some account i can’t use. but if there’s no hope for the money, i guess i’ll just deal with it.",2024-08-27 16:13:29,2,2,Reddit,UberEats

"food delivery services are out of hand i'd just like to say that i love the conscience of being able to order from restaurants when i'm working or bogged down at home with other things. the delivery fees are becoming astronomical now. i went to try and order some breakfast for my family and just looking at the prices is daunting. $34-36 for most of the i-hop family meals. on top of that there's the delivery fee which is understandable, the tax as well. can't just waive sales taxes but, the other fees that end up being $6-9 on average is ridiculous. on top of that we're expected to tip a minimum of 18% of that inflated total. looking at i-hop online shows me the same family meal for $26. i can get that, pick it up, and tip the hostess while still not reaching the ridiculous amount the food delivery services upcharge.

the argument of ""convenience"" is total bs. tell me what's convenient about waiting an hour or more for restaurants within 5 miles? not to mention the amount of drivers who genuinely don't care about the job and deliver things to wrong addresses without even trying to contact the recipient. there's no logical way to rationalize $10+$3.69+$9 in additional fees and then expect a tip of usually $6-7 depending on the basket. it is not about convenience and never has been. it is a scam to get essentially ""unpaid workers"" employed and pay them below the minimum wages. uber is the new and ""improved"" under the table but the government gets their kickback from it and everyone but uber and the government gets screwed.

edit 1: i also want to say that outside his door was approx 2 days worth of fast food trash and that i half believe him....but mostly he's just a scammer....either way being reported

"i almost lost it on some entitled uber eats driver tonight. i almost lost it on another uber eats driver tonight.  i wanted to cuss him the f**k out.  i was at the window in the drive thru line of a mcdonald’s picking up an order for a customer and all of a sudden i hear this happy no brain entitled uber eats driver whistling.  i see him in my mirrors and i’m watching him walk around my car and i knew he was going to wedge himself between my car and the window and he did just that.  my window was down and this dipsh*t sticks his head in the drive thru window and yells to the mcdonald’s employee inside and his ass is partially in my window.  i wanted to open my door on him sooooo bad and pin him to the wall for that stupid move.  meanwhile he’s saying “i’m an uber eats driver and i don’t need to wait in this line.”  meanwhile i’m thinking, “you stupid mother f**king b*tch.  how dare you get this close to me and demand that you be served first.”  the irony of him thinking he’s cutting ahead of customers when he just forced his way in front of another uber eats driver.      like how dense can you be????  he sounded like he was from ny.  for f**ks sakes.  go back to ny where you can get away with that sh*t.  down here in fl, hell no.  he’s lucky i wasn’t a big guy.  the area that i live in, there’s lots of people who carry.  you piss off the wrong person in my area and either you’ll end up in the hospital or 6ft in the ground.  i held myself back because i knew this guy would have started something with me and got in my face if i said something nasty and i cared more about making the delivery than getting in a fight with this guy.  i’ve never dealt with someone like that my entire time of being an uber eats driver and i’ve been doing it for over a yr and a half as a full time job.  god that pissed me off.  if i ever come across him and he pulls some sh*t like that again, i’m not going to hold back.  thankfully the drive thru person handed me my order before this guy and he had to move because he was blocking the entire window.  just a tip for all the uber eats drivers out there who think acting like that will get your order faster.  it won’t.  the amount of times i’ve seen an uber eats driver cut in front of me to get their order at a restaurant only to have the employee hand me mine first.  i love the stupid look on the uber eats drivers face when i get mine.  i swear it’s like the universe is teaching them a lesson that rushing and stepping on other drivers toes just to get ahead doesn’t f**king work.  i swear there’s some real idiot drivers out there.",2024-08-25 02:12:44,0,9,Reddit,UberEats

"how do i deal with insurance in ca? basically i'm new to driving and i got insurance on my car after getting a car/license (you have to it's the law duh) and literally on my 3rd day doing uber i called uber to report this guys driveway (i live in the mountains basically and so do these people ordering but some of these people are ridiculous and should not be ordering uber cause these are dangerous roads/driveways) well, uber put a claim that i was reporting an accident when i absolutely f#$%ing wasn't. doesn't matter, uber progressive contacted my aspire insurance or, aspire was snooping, i don't know which. 

  
so now, i'm getting mail demanding i explain what i'm using my car for etc. since i'm a new driver my insurance is already 80$ a month and since i live in kern county, i'm making like 900$ a month as is, i can't afford to magically pay 300-400$ a month for ""business insurance"" i must be missing something i can do, what's the point of prop 22 and assembly law 2293!?

how can insurance bully you like this when ca makes uber give insurance during deliveries? can i cancel my insurance and just use ubers? i really hate this, this happens to me so many times at new ""jobs"" i don't know what i'm doing or the ""unspoken rules"" and somehow i end up doing the one thing within the first 1-3 days and then after that i'm in the clear. but, by then the damage is done. 

  
i got adhd/mild autism man, i cant do normal work and i can't ever move out of my go damn parents house again if every time i try and make money i do something unknowingly or not that ruins the job. i'm forced to give my step dad 400$(not a lot i know) and 100$ for internet/elect/water. my food is 200-300(food stamps) and other expenses are about 300 so that leaves me like 150$ and that covers insurance and like 80$ for gas..

  
so what do ca residence do about insurance? what's the point of the ca assembly law and prop 22 when it seems your still forced to get your own business insurance???

i contacted support and she told me not to worry, she would set my cancellation rate back to 6%. 
she said to give it a couple hrs. 
this was almost a week ago. 
i contacted them back today and have messaged 3-4 different people. 
they all dont even read my message. they just explain how the cancellation rate works. 
anytime i have contacted about an issue they just repeat irrelevant information over and over instead of actually reading my message. 
oh there was that time i accidently hit delivered on an order i was in the way to. i thought it was still the previous order, so i hit delivered thinking a mistake happened when i tried doing it at the house. when i realized it was for my order that hadn't been delivered, i called support. 
they wouldn't give me the address and told me to throw the food away! thank god the customer called me and after explaining the mishap gave me their address. he even ended up tipping me much more. 
support is kinda wack. they don't seem to help out with any issue in my experience.

"received the wrong item and got a partial refund. this is one of those ""feel good"" posts with a ""feel bad"" ending.

so, i ordered through uber eats, received the food, and found out immediately that i received the wrong item (6 inch sub sandwich instead of a foot long sub sandwich).

i knew what to do, reported the problem through the app, provided photo evidence, and received a partial refund for the inconvenience in less than two minutes.  good, done  satisfied.

the reason i'm sharing this, however, is i'm stunned at how many customers don't know or don't want to know how to report an issue with their order, and i've seen it first hand.

customers have called restaurants directly shouting abuse and obscenities, they've shown up directly to intimidate the staff, and they've even blamed the delivery driver over the wrong items being delivered and tried to get the police involved.

it's just staggering to me that in the fifteen plus minutes that it took for some of these demented customers to act upon their disfigured rage against staff members in customer service, i simply followed the guidelines of the app and got the best result available in two minutes.",2024-08-24 07:04:58,0,4,Reddit,UberEats

finally about an hour and a half later it got picked up and i got the order is on its way message. when the driver was about to turn on to my road i made my way to my door to meet him. however as i watched the car round the corner on the map the car never appeared in real life. i waited and watched the car pull up to my house on the in app map. where it parked outside my house but still nothing in real life. it was late and i live on a quiet street, there was no car or anyone about but the map location was correct. 

i tried calling the driver who did answer, but i couldn’t hear anything beside wind and a bit of traffic. then finally the order cancelled.

"""a different driver already picked up that order"" leading to high cancellation rates. i've been getting very frustrated the last week. every time i'm sent an offer that i need to match with (instead of one being sent to me directly) i'll be told i'm the best match and to head to the restaurant.

every time i get there, i get an ""oh sorry, someone already picked that order up.""

okay, fine. i go into the app, and there's an option for ""order was already picked up."" you select it, and...it counts as a cancellation on your account. what gives? there isn't an order to be delivered anymore. why the hell does it count as a cancellation? it's not my fault uber fucked up.

i think that either by design or incompetence, they're matching multiple drivers to a request and just not caring or checking that it's been assigned. i'd be curious to see what one of those orders looks like on the customer's end.

i've been a platinum driver for three months, and this issue last week has caused my cancellation rate to be high enough to risk getting dropped from it.

"shouldn’t we consider estimated time of trip more important than mileage? new guy here so feel free to let me have it if i’m out of my element donnie, but perusing through these forums i only see people bringing up the 1 or 2 $/mile benchmark as their threshold for accepting an order, but what i’ve yet to see (only scrolling back about two weeks worth of posts…which tbf is a lot of posts) is anybody specifically advocating for considering a time threshold as more important?

the way i see it, you’re already (hopefully) tracking those miles and writing them off anyway, and sure there’s actual wear and tear to your car to consider, but my plan of attack has been to try and aim for accepting orders that are minimum $1 per every 2 minutes of estimated time (i.e. $7 order that takes 15 minutes is obviously much more favorable than a $7 order that estimates 30+ minutes even if the mileage is equal, let’s call it 5 miles in both scenarios). after that i’ve kind of used distance as a tie breaker. oh it’s a $9 offer for a trip estimated to take 22 minutes? but it’s 12 miles away? ok then ‘maayyybbeee’ it’s a no (but also maybe it’s a yes??).. am i even making any sense.

"priority delivery question hello! i am on a slightly hangry rampage trying to understand something. it's really not that big of a deal, but i was hoping a driver or otherwise knowledgeable internet stranger here could enlighten me.

i usually only order food when i'm busy with work. still, when i do, i always opt for priority delivery as the delivery is quick and the food quality is better. today, i ordered from a restaurant about 10 minutes from my home, and after my driver picked up the order, they started driving in the opposite direction for almost 20 minutes. i messaged them, and they called me to tell me they were delivering another order first. my food was nearly an hour late when it was all said and done.

this confused me as the whole purpose of priority delivery was that the food goes straight from the restaurant to your home without detours. would the uber eats delivery app not even allow her to have two orders at once if one is a priority?  is it possible she was working for multiple delivery services at a time? is that even allowed?

at this point in writing this post, i'm no longer hangry as i have now eaten, but i'd like to know so i'm not wasting money on priority delivery in the future.",2024-08-21 16:20:08,1,14,Reddit,UberEats

a few hours later, i get a declined charge from apple pay. mismatch amount. they try to charge 20.03. i pay the charge, but it showed 20 on uber eats again. once i paid it shows my order was 20.03, my card was charged 20 (as it should). however, had i paid not by apple pay those 0.03$ would be charged. i went back and looked and for the last 4 months all my orders have a few extra cents added. i am beyond angry, that is theft!

"are there any repercussions with uber eats when the driver steals the food? i ordered 80 euro worth of food last night at 8:30pm from two restaurants. the restaurants are about a 30 minute drive south from my hotel and for whatever reason, a bicycle delivery guy was selected. it said they would be delivered by 9:05.

i watched him slowly ride to each restaurant and pick up the food for a little over an hour (9:30 now), then he made his way up to my hotel and was 4 minutes away after 90 minutes (10pm now) when all of the sudden, he stopped and sat there for 5-10 minutes. then, he turned around and peddled east to about 23 minutes away from my hotel and never moved again. turned his phone off, never responded to text messages and i guess decided he wanted to eat my dinner himself. now it is 10:30pm

i tried to contact uber eats and it took forever to get to a person in the chat, because even thought it was 2+ hours, they kept saying he was on his way and would get the food to me soon. i tried to explain to the uber eats chat worker, that this guy had stolen it and was not bringing it. pretty sure he was at home as the tracking stayed for there the several hours until uber eats finally cancelled the order.

with the total lack of assistance from uber eats, and the total lack of caring that this was happening, i feel like drivers can do whatever they want and get away with it.",2024-08-20 07:35:49,42,149,Reddit,UberEats

i thought my order was taking a bit long so i checked the estimated arrival time and noticed it changed so i monitored it and it’s just adding 5 minutes every 5 minutes.

so my poor uber driver has been waiting outside the restaurant for over an hour now for what was supposed to be a 5 minute trip. is he being paid for this time? if not, i feel like i should update my tip to reflect the 12x time commitment. at the same time, i wouldn’t have bothered ordering a single burger combo if i knew i would have to.",2024-08-20 04:00:05,6,35,Reddit,UberEats

"ubereats still double charging me for tips for the past three or five orders, there has been an issue where ubereats keeps charging me twice for tips. i believe this is an issue with the app when you go to rate an order. while rating the order, you have the option to change the tip. i never do this as i always tip whatever i am able to so i have no need to make adjustments. however, after rating the order, ubereats then tries to charge me again except this time its for the price of the meal +2x the tip. for example, last night my order was exactly $27+ $4 tip totaling in 31$. yet after i rated the order, they tried to charge me $35 which is clearly because they are charging me twice for the tip. this is not the first time this has happened. i had previously contacted ubereats support about this issue and they told me they would have to escalate the issue. i still have not heard back and when i contacted them again yesterday about this latest issue, they again just said they would escalate me. i am done with this bs. luckily the transaction was pending on my pre-paid credit card and the funds where returned to me. if any ubereats rep reads this, which i highly doubt, you can either lower the charge to the original $31 that i agreed to pay or you will get no money at all and i will uninstall and never use the app again. i am not paying for double the tip i agreed to for what is now at least the 4th time in a row.",2024-08-19 17:57:46,10,17,Reddit,UberEats

"i cancelled because the restaurant was closed and called support. uber still increased my cancellation rate. wtf? (uber driver)  i've been delivering for ue for about 2 years now. just last night i accepted an order from a fast food place and the store was closed. so i called uber support and told them the issue. they told me ""don't worry this won't affect your cancellation rate."" they cancelled the order and it increased my cancellation rate. wtf? has this happened to anyone else?

this isn't the first time this happened to me. it also happened about a week ago.

i called support again and told them the issue. they said a lot of drivers were calling in about this and that they thought it was a glitch. they said they'd report the issue to the programming team.

now i'm really confused about uber's cancellation rate policy. if we cancel because a restaurant is closed does this increase our cancellation rate now? does this also apply to orders that were picked up by someone else?

as a driver i can't control if the restaurant closes early or if someone else picks it up. it seems like bullshit that drivers would be penalized for these issues. if uber sticks with this policy then the only thing i can do is be really picky and take only orders from really reliable restaurants in my area. this is mostly big name fast food and a few chinese places. tbh i'll probably just use other gig apps more.

in the end i think this is going to hurt the ue customers the most. if anyone orders from the wrong restaurant, then no one will want to accept the order. they'll get the order late or not at all.

update - it happened again tonight. took at taco bell order and the store lost the order in their system after 10 minutes. i called support and they told me it ""wont affect my rating."" they cancelled this one order and it increased my cancel rate by 2%!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! wtf???!!! i'm focusing on other apps now. uber eats is a mess! i'm starting to wonder if their business is failing as a whole.",2024-08-19 14:45:15,36,67,Reddit,UberEats

"am i going crazy?  okay my fellow uber eats drivers. 
please tell me i’m not the only one. 

i get a batch(2) order from a taco bell. 
i accept. 
i get to the taco bell and i see only one customer name.
thought i was tripping cause i swore i saw (2) when i accepted. 
i get to the house,snap a pic, and walk to my car. 
the app is directing me to another address with the customer’s name on the food that i had just delivered to the house at that precise moment. 
at that point i call uber support to let them know the situation and the customer of that house i just arrived to comes out and had to tell him to get a refund because i didn’t collect his order. 

but the thing is i never recalled his name being on my app when i arrived to the taco bell….. and because i already snapped the pic and completed that trip, yet also take the food back to my car to hand to the next address customer (because that’s where it belongs); now the customer who’s next to me who isn’t going to get his food has the capability of giving you a thumbs down rating which no driver should want. even though he gets refunded completely, they can still rate you down since the order has been marked as complete on their end…. and it wasn’t my fault since only one customer name came up before i confirmed at the restaurant even though i did remember the order showing as a batch order when it popped on my phone before i accepted. 

the crazy thing is that this happened to me about 3 weeks ago but from a mcdonalds…

i hope my quick ramble explanation makes sense!! (as i’m still working on orders currently lol)

"why the hell doesn't ue fix this? i get something like this almost every night. it's almost always a closed store. (occasionally a stolen order, but this time i know it is a closed store as the store closes at midnight and this was sent @ 12:37). the kicker is that i've told support several times when this exact store closes.

it is sooo tempting to just go to the store, and then go to the house and deliver nothing to collect this absurdly high payout. hell, maybe i should've just got them some cheap burger king $5 meals from across the street and deliver that!

while it may have its own problems, dd doesn't really have this problem, at least not to this extent....and with dd, i at least get half pay for going to the store. ue doesn't even give me the $3 for going to the store any more. there has to be a smarter way to address this than just having drivers repeatedly unassign, and then re-assigning it to waste another driver's time. does ue just care this little for the driver's time and money?

"los angeles customers: what happened? as a preamble, i'll say this comes from a place of empathy. i don't mean any offense, but have to state facts. i'm genuinely curious what changed.

i used to be able to call $1k a week a ""slow week."" i was taking between 30% and 40% of the orders offered to me.

the past few weeks have been so strange. my acceptance rate dropped below 20%. i took a stacked order for 20 miles yesterday, and one of the tips was 50c. yep, you read that right.

it's not so much that it's slower, but it's that there are no tips anymore, and by extension, no good orders.

i feel like most of the normal customers have dropped out. are the drivers as a whole doing so bad that customers have to be terrified of us, and can't trust us at all, even when we have 3k deliveries?

"is ubereats just not worth it anymore? i ordered a bundle from popeyes. he picks it up and started driving. nothing unusual.

i watch the dude go in a completely opposite direction, stop in a neighborhood for 15 minutes and then drive in the right direction. he didn't have another order because ubereats tells you if they do.

he arrives and doesn't get even out of the car. just rolls down the window and waves me over to take it from his hands. the only reason i even went over to get it is because i have a camera mounted on my front door. i could see he had a bunch of other bags from other restaurants on his passenger seat. i didn't think anything of it.

i get in the house and notice the bag is very light. i open it up and see a small ass popeyes bag with less than a third of my order. bag isn't even closed properly.

so i tried calling. ignored me. i took back my tip and reported him, and sent pictures to ubereats detailing the whole thing. 

afterwards i thought i was just being paranoid.

so i decide to call the popeyes to make sure i'm not jumping to conclusions. they tell me the bag at the minimum has to have my receipt with stapled on the bag so the driver knows who it is for. they bring the manager and we come to the conclusion that my order was stolen as there was no receipt and he never even confirmed my name, and that i need to report the driver to uber. 

this used to be a once a year thing at worst that i'd have to report an order/driver. now i'm getting stolen food, incorrect orders and shady people/false identities about once a month. sometimes they would never show up and uber support would mark the order as ineligible for a refund. i would go and get these orders myself if my car didn't threaten to explode in this heat so often.

i asked them what am i supposed to do when i do not receive my order,  and even though they admitted that he delivered my food to the wrong address, they told me it was the right address and there is nothing i can do to at least get my money back.

"delivery cost / service charge not refunded with missing items hello, i am from the uk and they recently made getting reimbursed for missing or damaged items in your order more difficult. it used to be that you could go through a digital menu on the app, take a picture and they would refund you. now, i usually have to call someone which is fine for me, but for people with social anxiety this can cause issues.

  
anyway, recently i noticed uber eats has not been refunding me for some of the delivery cost/ service fee, which can be a big chunk of the cost. sometimes 30-50% of my items will be missing, and i will only get refunded for that item (if i am lucky). i believe that as i am paying for the missing items to be delivered and those items are not present, i should get a partial refund of the amount.

  
interested to everyone's opinions on this. it goes without saying too that the drivers are not paid enough and of course here in uk most people know that, it's just uber eats itself that causes the problems in my opinion.",2024-08-16 04:13:55,2,1,Reddit,UberEats

when i choose this option, i don't want them to knock, call me or wait until i go outside. i just want them to leave it there.
please tell me why is it so hard for some of those drivers. 
a few weeks ago, the driver wouldn't stop knocking until i went outside. today i had the same driver, so i got immediately annoyed. 
but i was like i don't care any more, i'm not answering the door no matter what, he can take this order back for all i care.
this time he knocked, waited a couple of minutes and called me. and i'm like i choose the option to leave it at the door, don't wait for me, just go. finally, he said he left it, and i thought that's it. i waited a bit to be sure he left already, and i wanted to go get it. but then i saw he was still sitting in the car outside. he called me again after 5 minutes, asking when am i gonna get it because he's already been waiting for a long time. 
at this point, i'm really pissed off. 
and i tell him again, that i choose to leave it at the door, not meet me at the door, to just leave it and go. and why is he waiting, if i choose this option?
i honestly started to freak out, it was really weird. i'm a woman, and i'm home alone, there's no way i'm opening that door, especially if i order something in the evening and choose no-contact delivery.
all of that took like 10 minutes. why on earth is this freaking driver waiting so long outside my house when i specifically asked to leave it at the door? it should take a minute or two, not 10.
not to mention that talking to him was nearly impossible, as he seemed to barely know any english.

do delivery drivers upload receipts?? if they go into a store does the receipt printed have to be uploaded. asked uber about showing me the receipt of a grocery delivery and they skirted around the request. i no fault of my own have had a more than usual refund request because of restaurant mess ups not drivers. so sometimes it's harder for me to get a refund or adjustment. but last week when i got a promo for 50 percent off groceries i did it. when i got my groceries i noticed the meat i received was not the correct weight for what i was charged. messaged uber asked if they had a receipt uploaded by driver to see what the price was that was charged and if i could get that adjusted back to me. they skirted the request like i mentioned before and said they did a proper adjustment which i didn't notice. a few days pass by and i don't know how i didn't notice when i received the groceries but i ordered 24 glass coke bottles. my request was for 500ml and i received 350ml so again i messaged uber and asked for a receipt of the original purchase to show i wasn't lieing about the mix up. again they skirted the question and just refunded me the whole price of the bottles. i feel like a jerk but if it was just possible to show the original receipt to the customer of what was purchased it'd be easier for both sides to argue their point.,2024-08-14 21:39:12,0,26,Reddit,UberEats

"double charged (not auth hold) i’m so mad.

ordered from ubereats on july 30th. got charged the typical authorization hold (which was immediately reversed) and then the pre-tip order charge. all is well so far.

when my order arrived it was missing an item, so i submitted a help ticket and they told me they’d refund the value of the item to my card in a couple of days and provided me with an adjusted order total. checked my bank account and saw that they debited the adjusted order total from my account as well. so now i’ve been double charged for an order that wasn’t even complete.

after a couple of days, i noticed the charge had not been reversed so i got in touch with uber support, who repeatedly told me that my math was wrong (you could very clearly see my account balance go down with each transaction in the screenshot i sent) and that the second adjusted charged would be reversed in a few days because it was a “second authorization hold”.

well, it’s been over two weeks and i haven’t received the money back from being double charged, nor have i received the refund for the missing item. i feel bad for nagging about the issue to support, because obviously these poor support people are just doing their job and i assume their scope of support is limited, but i’m so sick of being gaslighted about the issue.

i spoke to the bank yesterday and the bank confirmed that there was no authorization hold on the second charge and that i had indeed been wrongfully charged twice for the order. they also confirmed that the refund should have been deposited into my account several days earlier, but it had not been. their advice was to escalate the problem through the bank so that they can do a charge back, but obviously uber will deactivate my account if i try to get the money they stole from me back.

today i was asked by an uber customer service rep to provide my entire bank statement from the day i was charged for the order until today to prove that i was double charged and that i never received a refund. super invasive but i covered as much private info as possible and submitted because i want my freaking money back.

has anyone else had a similar experience? it really freaks me out because i’ve been using uber for years and i’ve had many orders arrive incomplete and have submitted tickets to have those items refunded. i have no clue if they’ve double charged me like this before.

"canceled $50 order within 30secs of placing; ""order inelligible for refund"" so i travel for work, i live out of hotels. today i went to go place an order, and accidently ordered food from a restaurant to the hotel in the previous city i was in. the only reason i realized there was an issue was during the 5 second confirmation screen i noticed a line of text that said something along the lines of ""looks like you're not in the area"" or some such. i wasn't able to hit the cancelation button then because i was trying to figure out what happened.

i realized what the mistake was, and within 30 seconds canceled the order only to recieve a notice ""you have been charged x amount"".

when i tried to contact customer service through the app and explain the situation, i got a pre written reply stating the ""order is not eligible for a refund, next time contact customer service before canceling"" and then the the chat closed without any further prompt.

so i called uber eats customer service phone, figuring it was just an issue with the automated system and a human would undoubtedly understand the situation and get me situated. 

upon calling the line, i got almost the exact same reception and response, they wouldn't even listen to me trying to explain the situation. 

when i said i wanted to escalate the call to a supervisor, they told me that a supervisor would call me back within 24-48hrs, and then proceeded to hang up on me.

"ubereats is the worst! i just placed an order with a local food cart by using the ""order again"" option. somehow the order went through as something else that i've never ordered before. i tried to cancel but it's almost impossible to cancel an order via their app. i had to google it and look it up first. not sure what the experience is like on iphone, but on android you have to go into the help menu and talk to the uber ai in order to cancel the order. there's no direct option. it's not very intuitive. im willing to bet the money i lost that uber does this on purpose too. 

finally managed to cancel the order, only to be charged over 50% of the total order cost. uber's reasoning was because i waited too long to cancel and the restaurant had already started making the food for me. 

that's almost sounds fair, but it's not. i didn't screw up the order, the app did. and i tried to cancel right away, but, like i said above, the app doesn't make it easy. additionally, i tried calling the restaurant (montage a la cart). i called them like 8 times in a row with no answer. uber eats and montage a al cart suck. 

i understand im just one person, and my $50 bucks every couple of weeks ain't gonna put no one out of business, but im never again using uber or eating at montage. they can all suck a carrot. on monday im calling my bank and doing a chargeback.

"my driver somehow stole my order without being given a pin i thought the pin was to provide security towards the drivers and protect them against false claims while also giving the customers assurance that the drivers wouldn't steal the food.

yes i tipped, $5 on an order 1.5 miles down the street. total bill after coupons came out to $20 so that's 25 percent.

i always come out to the curb so my drivers never have to leave the car, despite living in a house and knowing how much easier it is to deliver here than an apartment.

apparently this driver didn't expect me to be waiting for them at the curb because they pretended to pick up the food, drove to the corner,, sent me a message saying the restaurant was closed, and sped off the moment they saw me and realized i was walking towards them.

i was charged the full amount. i know for a fact at a certain point uber stops giving people refunds after a certain amount regardless of the validity and this is the second time i've had to report a driver, with proof, that they stole my food this month. thankfully i was still given the refund, but now i'm scared if it happens again i won't get it back.

not to toot my own horn but screw it, toot toot, because i'm always thinking about ways to make this work easier for drivers (i was one for 5 years) and i think i'm a great person to deliver for. i once gave a guy a $20 tip and advice on how to decline orders like that next time when my assigned restaurant was changed to one that was 15 miles away just because i used a location specific coupon (no the app didn't tell me the location changed). i don't even have money like that, i just have free uberone because of work and i never order unless i have a promo/coupon, but i just felt so bad.

at this point i'm just venting. i try to be so courteous to drivers and every now and then i don't get that courtesy back in return, or worse yet stuff like this happens.  i miss the days of locally hired w-2 drivers and the days people used to tip, instead of complaining about how ""tipping culture has gone too far"" when we've tipped the delivery person for decades and has nothing to do with how every ipad has a tip screen now.",2024-08-11 15:58:43,2,25,Reddit,UberEats

"the uber driver app: the good, the bad, and the... wtf? the good:

they have improved the overall information and interactivity of the app. it has gotten much better over the last 2 years that i've been driving.

trip radar is much improved because it comes up just like any other regular order and you can see and move the map around to see where you're going as opposed to just seeing a microscopic little square with black lines that don't tell you anything.

the bad:

if you persist in using the uber navigation within the app, expect to be taken to the wrong places. expect to never be able to find the delivery location. expect to be told to turn left into oncoming traffic on a one-way road. expect to have directions that tell you to turn literally 180° into a parking lot when that's illegal and the cops are watching. expect to be driving across a major bridge over a huge river and have the gps tell you to turn right into the river.

use some other form of navigation. google maps or drive or whatever but don't use the in-app navigation.

toll roads. if you use the in-app navigation, despite what i said above, expect to use every single toll road and pay massive amounts of tolls just to drive a few miles. it's like a super magnet yanking you toward the most expensive route option possible. and regardless of what tech support says, you are never compensated for those tolls. you can whine and complain to them that you never got the payment and they will insist that you did but it will never reflect on your payment report.

i don't know why but every time i try to look at the pickup information or the order information whether it's a food delivery, a shop and pay pickup, or a package pickup... and then when i'm trying to take the delivery to the location, if i'm trying to see the drop off instructions, what apartment number, what house number or whatever... every single time i pull up that information, within 3 seconds the app automatically closes it and shows me the full map. and i can continue to pull up the information and it will immediately scroll it back down and hide it showing the full map. there are times i literally have to pull up the information more than a dozen attempts in order to see anything.

the ugly:

shop and pay has become intolerably ridiculous.

it used to be when you arrive at the grocery store to make the purchases, the order was complete and all you had to do was go in, fill your cart and check out. now, it allows the customers to actively change the order while you're in the grocery store picking up the items. i've had multiple times where i have been loading up the cart with items and then those items were removed by the customer by the time i got to the checkout and replaced by something completely different.

not to mention how many people order multiple 36-48 pack 16.9oz bottled water. i can handle one. but when they order five or six of them? and they expect us to climb the stairs with all of them? that's an instant cancel for me. it's the main reason i no longer do shop and pay orders on a regular basis. simple math, you're talking 50 lb per multipack on average.

then there's the fact that the app will automatically enable shop and pay when you have physically disabled it. there are times where i will spend the day with it completely turned off and suddenly i'll get a walgreens or jewel-osco pickup that ends up being a shop and pay order when i completely turn that option off.

and the qr tax exempt code? half the time it either does not work at all or is literally an empty screen that say  ""scan the qr code"" but... there's nothing there.

i apologize if this feels like a rant. it is intended to be a list of things that are just driving me nuts and making me never want to work again.

"uber eats driver pulled the fire alarm and now my condo is charging me for the bill  i ordered food and after the delivery driver had delivered it and was on his way out of the building, he pulled the fire alarm. this caused fire trucks to be dispatched to our building. our property manager called me and said i would be responsible for the bill.

any advice on what i should do here?

update:
the property manager called and said that the driver didn’t look like he did it on purpose from the video footage. the fire alarm he pulled is by the exit doors and it looks like he got confused. my building has a red button that you need to push in order for the door to open.
i understand that this sucks that he got confused but still don’t see how i should be responsible.

"seeking advice from drivers i utilize uber/ubereats on a fairly regular basis. i completely appreciate the service and all of those in the industry. i tip well, am gracious and i almost always give a 5 star rating to my drivers. i absolutely do not like giving less than 5 stars, i don't want to mess up anyone's source of income. so unless the experience (usually with uber drivers) is really bad, 5 stars automatic. 

tonight my ubereats driver delivered my food, but there are some issues and i'm seeking insight on the best course of action. 

the issues: 3 people in the car and my ""driver"" wasn't driving and handed my food from the back seat. i get that sometimes the driver will have someone with them. especially women, because of safety issues. and i'm okay with that! but my drivers were always the one driving. this one was in the back seat. the next issue, when they opened the car, well, i could have gotten a contact high from the smoke rolling out. i'm 4/20 friendly, and have definitely been in ubers where you could tell they smoke in the car, but this was literal smoke rolling out and the odor was strong! okay, not great, but i might have been okay with it. but the biggest issue was that my bag of food smelt strongly of it as well. like everyone in my house could smell it. and this has never happened and honestly, it bothers me. 

what do you think is a fair thing for me to do? it was my initial intent (before all of this) to actually increase my tip from $7 to $10 because the place was further away than i realized. but now i'm definitely not doing it. i don't think they deserve 5 stars. just looking for guidance and appreciate any insight!

upon checking the bag it has 1 item that i ordered and it is missing 6 other items from my order. they provided 2 alternative items that i did not want. so in total i received 3 items. only 1 item was from my original order. 2 of these items were also cold and stale. i guess it did not help that i placed an order at 7:30pm when the restaurant closes at 8pm? but surely they should update the app to show what items are unavailable?

i explained all of this to uber eats uk on instagram and sent photos of what i received along with my receipt and they have advised me that they have looked into this and can't refund due to their policies? wtf?

"bogo and 40% off, new user questions i have uber installed (no car, live in area with bad public transportation) and occasionally use it for errands to places that are far away. i do not use uber eats. recently, i got an offer for 40% off on two purchases of $15 or more (max $12 savings).

i looked in uber eats and see that many restaurants offer buy one, get one free deals, and was wondering if those could be combined with this 40% off thing. i was thinking of ordering indian food. i saw this past post: https://www.reddit.com/r/ubereats/comments/17f1fzl/does_40_off_no_longer_stack_on_bogo_orders/

does this mean the offers cannot be combined, or that they can be combined, but the one item you pay for has to cost over $15? if the second is true, then wouldn’t you effectively be getting two items for the cost of 60% of an item + tips (what percentage is expected? 15%? 20%? some people say it $1 per mile, and the closest indian restaurant to my apartment is 17 miles away, which would make the tip cost more than the actual food), or around 60% off given a 20% tip? also, how does $0 delivery fee on $15 or more work with the discount? if i buy something for $20 and get another one for free, and it goes down to $12 due to the 40% discount, would i get free delivery?

how worth it is this offer? i eat at restaurants very rarely (only twice in the last six months, once at my office cafeteria, another time at wendy’s). is 60% off restaurant food competitive with grocery prices (cheaper or only slightly more expensive)? is the per-item cost of restaurant food ordered on uber greater than the per-item cost of the same restaurant food ordered in person?

thank you.

"this is what happens when you don’t tip on a long distance delivery got a ridiculously bad offer earlier tonight. $4.25 for 16 miles from smashburger in a thunderstorm. it was in a semi-rural area so i’d likely have to drive much of the way back too. i obviously declined.

30 minutes later i’m driving back to a hotspot after a delivery. i see another terrible offer. $3.50 for 10 miles from five guys. before i decline i realize something - this is going to the exact same guy as before!

could this guy have been really hungry and ordered burgers twice? it’s possible but unlikely. here’s what probably happened instead. every single driver declined the smashburger offer and the base fare didn’t get high enough before the store closed, so uber had to cancel the order. so the customer decided to order from a burger place that was actually open - in this instance, five guys - and didn’t tip again. now he’ll be waiting for a long time again because no one wants to make that trip for that little money.

it’s an hour and a half after i got the initial bad offer and i wouldn’t be surprised if his food still hasn’t been delivered. that’s what you get when you don’t want to tip your driver.",2024-08-06 21:56:42,323,270,Reddit,UberEats

i called the restaurant and they confirmed they gave the order to driver #1. at this point, i'm assuming he sat in the parking lot and ate my food. and before anyone asks, i tipped about $4 on an $18 order.

i was surprised by this response. even though i wasn’t asking for a refund, i also didn’t expect such a perfunctory resolution. a $5 promo or coupon would have been a reasonable gesture for the inconvenience.

on my app, it says that i must upload insurance documents within 14 days to continue. does this mean i can deliver for uber eats for 14 days without providing insurance before they stop me? if i do this, will they still allow me to cash out on what i made for those 14 days and then i just stop after that?

"never received order, denied a refund, and had account locked this might be the dealbreaker on my decision to uninstall this app ladies and gentleman. uber eats is deliberately forcing me to pay for an order that i disputed with my bank that uber refused to refund even though i never received it, and my account will remain locked until i pay the outstanding balance of about $50. basically at this point uber is blackmailing me to allow their obvious theft which i am not going to allow. over time, i have learned to deal with uber's bs for years now from a missing straw to entire missing sides but i think this takes the cake. basically my delivery person barely spoke english, i noticed he was far off from my house and called him to tell him my address when i heard ""no habla ingles"" and had the biggest face palm. i got out google translate on my ipad and tried my best and repeated my address as best as i could but he proceeded to give some lucky f\*\*k  7 miles away from me my $50 order. i texted uber to act as a liaison but the driver apparently told them i gave the wrong location even though i repeated my address 5+ times and my marked address is 100% where i live. uber support took his word for it and told me it was my fault and they couldn't do anything even though i sent the idiot support guy screenshots of me in fact sending the delivery person my address. the support guy then responded with ""sorry, we can't do anything at this time"" and ended the chat. later after not allowing their obvious theft and lying, i disputed the charge but i can't use uber now until i pay off the charge. i don't care anymore if uber has the most access to restaurants in my area. i'm so tired of the lies and deceptive practices uber does and will gladly take only the 4 (wendy's,mcdonald's, taco bell, burger king) fast food restaurants on doordash because i know at least i'll get my food and not get scammed.

anyway tried to contact support and they said they can't adjust ratings and that merchants have their right to leave reviews. they were no help. i just feel defeated. it's so dumb. the only reasoning i can think of is someone just downvoted every order at that restaurant and store because they hate drivers. on one hand i don't blame them there are so many pushy and nasty drivers i see. rant over...",2024-08-04 06:27:35,6,20,Reddit,UberEats

"""well that's just not true..."" 🙄 i'm just about to start denying all starbucks orders at this point. typically they are low pay, end up having crazy specific and/or odd notes, and usually very entitled people. 

today i grabbed what is probably going to be my last starbucks delivery. just barely met my minimum rule, i should have skipped it. it was going to our local hospital the main building so i figure it's some nurse or someone visiting. order is labeled as met at door and has a note that says meet at security/front desk. cool no prob. i pull up and try to call no answer. 

i wait with no response, fine, again no prob. apps says i can dispose of it. aka free coffee. instead, i leave it with the security guys who both seemed quite used to delivery orders and say the'll hold it. then i'm off to the next. 

mid transition to my next pick up in comes the call. lady wanting to know were her starbucks is. i let her know it's at the security desk like she requested. there is a huff and she just says another address that i've not been to today. i say i don't know anything about that address. the order i just completed was from the starbucks location to the hospital drop off again that's were i left it. she screams at me for a whole minute about that's not were she's at. when it's finally silent i can get a word in, i am able to say, look that's were the app sent me i just follow the gps. a final huff followed by the words ""well thats just not true"" then i'm hung up on. 

maybe double check your address and actually answer when i call you. might help with these things. 🙄 no surprises but she pulled the tip, of course. i should've taken the coffee instead of leaving it. ",2024-08-03 21:53:43,20,12,Reddit,UberEats

i’m currently stuck at home with a virus, cannot leave the house. all i wanted was a hot and spicy chicken sandwich to clear my sinuses. 1.5 hours later and my dasher is still picking up more orders along the way. the place i ordered from was 15 minutes down the road (typical for texas by the way), and i know for sure it’s going to arrive cold. no temperature controlled bag is going to save it. drivers, stop with the stupid entitlement. do your job right and you’ll be tipped generously. with the declining state of the service industry, i’m sure customers would be appreciative if you do your job right without expecting an upfront handout.",2024-08-03 21:15:44,0,36,Reddit,UberEats

"(uk) is there a way to contact via email or live chat?? the main thing i was trying to order wasn’t available but it said it would pick and also review with me a substitute (which there were many options of in the store) so i chose this option ‘best match’ instead of a specific one because it said it they would contact and review the substitute while shopping - i thought this was the safest and more open option but also because it wouldn’t let me write/comment anything regarding the substitute if it wasn’t available 

it just said the item was out of stock though and never gave me the option to review or any substitute. they said it wouldn’t be charged for that item but that’s pointless because it had the other smaller items but now i’ve got to make a whole new order + the minimum order fee + service fee + delivery fee just to get one thing which could have been avoided if they had reviewed with me and offered a substitute or didn’t state i would be so then i would have just picked a specific item instead

"done with all food delivery yeah, i've had enough meals ruined now that i think i'll just not even bother anymore. i switched from doordash to ubereats specifically because of the string of messed up orders and for a while uber was a lot more dependable. but now that i've had the 3rd incorrect order in a row, i'm done. 

the main issue in my experience is not the drivers (most of the time they seal the bag so the driver wouldn't be able to check that the order is correct even if they wanted to), but the restaurants preparing the orders. i've seen videos of places like chipotle very intentionally giving way smaller portions for delivery orders and i'm certain this happens at other restaurants as well. whether this is due to the restaurant management hating having to deal with order pickups or uber/doordash/etc charging too many fees or whatever, i don't care. the end result is still a bad experience for the customer. the only benefit is not having to go pick up the food yourself. literally everything else is a negative. 

what ends up happening is i get wrong/missing food, submit a help ticket with uber and the automated system issues a refund (well, uber credit of course) for a portion of the order and everyone goes on about their day. but getting $5 back for a ruined meal doesn't do it for me. even if they refunded the entire thing it wouldn't solve the problem. contacting the restaurant itself doesn't do anything as any solution they would give doesn't fix the fact that, say, i don't have any tortillas for my fajitas. i could drive to the restaurant and pick some up or have them replace the entire meal, but now i've wasted time doing the thing i was avoiding by ordering delivery in the first place. missing or different items are one thing, but in my experience it's often a missing component of an item. most recently it was an order of biscuits and gravy (don't judge me, i live in the south) and there was no gravy. again, the bag was sealed and the label said ""biscuits and gravy"", so obviously the driver just picked up the bag and left. just sheer incompetence and the restaurants don't care because the customer isn't there to complain. 

and writing this out, this all sounds like a trivial thing to complain about in the grand scheme of life. but if i'm going to pay a premium to get food delivered, the bare minimum is for that food to be correct. and it would appear at this point it's literally just a gamble every time.

food showed up at my door about 30 minutes later, and the bag looked like it had been opened and rifled through. and the only thing in the bag were two containers of veggies. neither of the main dishes i ordered were in the bag. 

i call the driver back through the app. he looks around his car and says he sees one more bag in his back seat and must have gotten the orders mixed up. he said he’s in the middle of another delivery but would bring my food once he dropped off the other delivery.

i arrived there in 10mins, i waited a bit, and the cashier asked me about which was the order and she said, “ok, its gonna be ready soon”. the sotre was completely empty except for me and one delivery guy. the staff made in front of me 2 different orders for that delivery guy, and then they did my order from scratch.

does someone know this for sure?? that the orders don't start till the delivery guy is there.

tldr:  stores dont give a crap if they prepare or not the food, they just need to change ther order status to “preparing” to secure the cash.",2024-08-02 00:44:58,5,11,Reddit,UberEats
"is it the restaurant or ue that cancels orders and gives no reason? i’ve had this happen a couple of times. today it took me a quite while to decide where i wanted to order from. i placed the order and everything seemed fine until something like 15 minutes had passed and i got a notification that the order was cancelled. there was no explanation. this happened in mid to late afternoon which i wouldn’t think would be a busy time. i was very hungry and frustrated. 

if there was an explanation given it still would have been frustrating, just less so. the ridiculous customer service features on the app make getting help…or even a reason for the situation…seem impossible when the help you need doesn’t fit in the categories you’re given to click on. 

if i knew it was a problem with the restaurant accepting my order and then deciding, for whatever reason, not to fulfill it, i could take it up with them or leave a negative review. i don’t want to do that if it was ue that cancelled. 

i’ve worked in the service industry in the past and know all too well that the server in front of you or c/s agent on the phone probably has little to no fault when things get screwed up. i don’t feel it’s necessary to take my frustration out on them just because they happen to be the face in front of me or the one that answered the problem. i do feel it’s right to let someone who might have the ability to do something know when things make me angry enough to no longer be a customer. at least it gives them a chance to know why they’re losing customers and hopefully do something to fix the situation. 

can someone explain to me why the order might have been cancelled? driver shortage? restaurant too busy (unlike at 3:30 or 4:00)? glitch in the system? order too small to bother with (it was well over the minimum amount)? 

i don’t want to delete the app but this is the kind of thing that might push me to do it. i would love for ue or the restaurant (which ever is to blame) to work out the issues. or just not access an order they might not be able to deliver. hungry and pissed off because you were expecting to eat in about 10 minutes only to be told you have to figure something else out is is enough to make you hold a grudge. it’s not a good way to keep customers.

i appreciate any insight into the workings of this system so i can know where to direct my anger. 

edit: this morning i called the restaurant (burgerfi) and spoke to the manager that was working yesterday afternoon. she told me it was absolutely uber eats that canceled the order. she told me i was far from the first person to have this happen. i could tell from her voice that she was sincere and not just shifting the blame. 

knowing this was my first experience with a burgerfi, and not a good one, she asked if i could ever come into the store so she could offer me a free meal and let me try the food. she is also going to let her gm know that ue has screwed the pooch yet again so they can pressure them to fix whatever is breaking down in their system. 

i’m glad i made the phone call instead of just blasting the restaurant with a scathing review. ",2024-08-02 00:07:54,2,10,Reddit,UberEats
"us drivers: what is an appropriate tip? hi all

some friends and i are planning to visit los angeles and san francisco next year and i'm just wondering how to calculate an appropriate, i've seen a lot of conflicting comments on the subject with some saying $2-4 is okay, some others say a percentage of the total bill before discounts, and some just say it depends on how many items and/or the distance between the restaurant and the delivery address without giving an exact calculation. i understand each driver has their own definition of what is and isn't an acceptable tip but when some drivers expect a tip before even accepting the order it makes it hard to establish.

ok so i guess i didn't know, redacted isn't the right word here. i should have used removed.

for clarity here i was offered 9.97 for the job, and afterwards reviewed 2.34 because the customer removed the portioned labeled as tip.

"can't cancel order even if items are not available. ordered food from a restaurant, but their kitchen is partially down. i can understand that. what i can't understand is why uber eats tells me it will charge the \_full price\_ on cancellation of such order, and provides no other logical option for cancellation. no way to contact the restaurant, nothing on deliver driver side, support bot is not helpful, etc.

the only option is to substitute, even if i don't want the resulting substitution because kitchen is partially down, or loose the entire price of the order for basically nothing.

service with uber/uber eats is slowly degrading, this may be the last straw until i just switch to another platform entirely.

upd on comments (can't even respond to comments due to subreddit rules!):

waiting the clock out: i don't want to wait for the food forever, so that's not really on the table. notably: there is no ""clock to wait out"" to speak of - app shows no timer etc, so i assume 20-30 minutes?

contacting the restaurant: through what? ui only allows me to chat with the driver who does not know/can't cancel either.

chargeback: i'd then just scam the restaurant in their eyes, so that's not a solution.

i mean... all 3 things are not great options considering the app is supposed to just have a ""cancel"" button which allows me to contact the restaurant, and even finding the button needs me to navigate support bot maze. option 3 is just punishing the restaurant and driver for uber's fault... so in all honesty i will just look for alternative platforms at this point. uber eats and uber in general only works if everything is going fine. let 1 thing go wrong, and you are left with no support.",2024-08-01 15:30:23,3,6,Reddit,UberEats

"“meet at door” order became a nightmare for the customer got a good mcdonald’s order this evening, $7 and some change for 3 miles. i thought it was unusual that she chose “meet at door” since it was past 9 pm. and i’m sure she regrets that because of what happened.

the customer had a dog which was barking pretty loud, i was a little worried at first when it came outside but it was just jumpy and didn’t want any part of me. the scary part happened when the dog noticed another dog taking a walk nearby. this customer’s dog ran full speed at the other dog and attacked it. i went back to my car pretty quickly because i wanted no part of dealing with two pissed off dogs. when i backed out of their driveway the dog owners were still trying to pry them apart. i turned onto another road and past their backyard and it looked like things had calmed down a little by then.

all of this could have been avoided if the customer just chose “leave at door.” she could have waited after i left and the dog wasn’t on high alert. but for some reason i just had to hand her the order. it will never cease to amaze me how some dog owners know their dogs’ behavior can be volatile and still aren’t careful with letting them around strangers or other dogs.",2024-07-29 01:46:39,6,11,Reddit,UberEats

"psa: check your total before you order and after your food is delivered this is ontario, canada, if that makes a difference.

i order food, and i get an email from paypal confirming the dollar amount. i then get my food, and afterwards, ubereats charges a 10 to13 cents extra to my total. i'm not just imagining it because this time paypal actually emailed me saying ubereats increase their price afterwards.

before i had an issue where i would tip while i initially order, and the tip in system afterwards would add an extra 10 cents. (so e.g. if i order $15 food, and tip $2, and when i go in to rate the food and driver, the tip would become $2.10, so if you don't check the amount, you're paying 10 cents more than you intended.)

i reached out to the customer representative regarding the tip changing in system because it happened on multiple orders, but they would cycle through representatives that either doesn't understand what my issue is or just says tip can be adjusted after an hour. so their system is either glitching or is doing this on purpose, and my only solution is to ""fix"" the problem on my end by being diligent. this means then i can't tip beforehand, and potentially affect (someone correct me if i'm wrong) whether a delivery person takes my order or not. which sucks.

but now that i don't tip beforehand, they're changing the price of the food after it's delivered. i submitted a form to the customer representative on why the price increased after my food's delivered, and we'll see what they say... hopefully it won't take 5 emails just to get 5 different representatives not understanding what the issue is. just wanted to give everyone a heads up in case this is affecting other people.",2024-07-27 17:45:04,0,3,Reddit,UberEats

"guessed dara's email, sent a rant, got called by support 😲 the phone call came in fast, shocking. if i publish the email, is he going to change it? 🤔

no resolution to my issue, got the same song and dance that chat and twitter support gave. he then said, ""meet me over at chat support."" why? so you can copy and paste the same script? no thanks, hung up. 

however, if you have a legit problem like unfair deactivation, i think the email is useful since the call came in quickly. i said, ""8yrs as a driver, many of us are quitting and your doing nothing to retain us. your script is irrelevant, doesn't matter that you're american."" 

my e-mail rant was that delivery customer reduced tip by $2 for no reason. picked up his food, delivered it and tip reduction. stop allowing tip reduction for no reason! force the eats customer to give a reason then share the reason with the driver. shop & pay give plenty of feedback, but not eats? 

i told the rep that now everytime i accept a delivery, there's fear that the amount can change. all of the other times, uber reimbursed as an adjustment and with this they didn't. for this reason i officially quit uber. i found myself a new job within the span of a week and i start next week.

also, i don't take tip bait or reductions lying down. i found a way to reimburse myself through ubereats, trust and believe! be careful doing this, though, you can get deactivated. there's a way to do it so that the stolen item doesn't go to another driver and be careful doing it because if they see you do it over and over, they will see a pattern develop. i just wanted uber to know that they're literally losing an 8yr veteran driver over $2

i'll only be doing uber now and then for extra spending cash and i'll be cherry picking the heck out of everything

i'll only drive when others aren't, especially during freezing weather, snow, rain and high surge times.

and by the way, the delivery was already surged, so i'm happy abou that part. i bet that uber reduced it due to the surge and found a way to make it seem like the tip was reduced. uber is shady af.

"uber paying $200m over its ipo scandal  hey guys, here are probably some uber investors, so this info might be really useful for you (not like our infamous coupons). if you remember, uber had a scandal over its ipo — good news that they just recently decided to pay $200m to resolve it. 



for the newbies: back in 2020, uber increased subsidies for drivers and meals during its ipo, which also increased expenses for sales and marketing. moreover, they were also planning to cut the costs and turned out that it could have influenced the overall growth. 



so, after all this news, their stock dropped (obviously) and investors sued them afterwards. 



good news that just recently they finally decided to pay a $200m settlement to all damaged investors to resolve this scandal. so, if you bought it back then, you can check the details and file for the [payment here](https://11thestate.com/cases/uber-investor-settlement).



anyway, another day another scandal for uber. tbh i am not surprised by the scandal, but surprised that they decided to pay over this (well, at least something). were some of you investors back then? or how much did you lose on uber overall at this point?

"i was fully refunded a 150 dollar order because it “never arrived” but it did i ordered 150 dollars worth of food today on uber eats.

the app told me, my delivery person was arriving and to meet him at the door. i went and got the food and he didn’t take a picture, just left.

15 minutes into our meal, i noticed the order was still running in my phone. i assumed it was a glitch or that my internet had dropped out and we continued to eat. an hour later i picked up my phone again and it was still going. this time it said the delivery was past it’s latest estimate and it came with an apology. i looked for a button i could press to confirm the order had in fact been delivered and we had received it but i couldn’t find one. i didn’t think it was a big deal. i assumed again that it was either a technical glitch on my end or that my driver would notice soon and confirm the order had been handed over if it was on his end. i did some chores and took a nap, so i wasn’t on my phone again for a while and i forgot about it. 5 hours after we had received the order, i noticed a full refund from uber in my bank account.

i opened the app and it showed me a receipt for my order, saying “your order could not be delivered.” with a list of everything that had arrived that we had already eaten, and a full refund, making the total 0 dollars.

my bf thinks the drivers phone could have died just before he could end the order, or maybe he switched delivery apps and somehow forgot to confirm our order.

i’m conflicted. on one hand it feels like a lucky day for us. a free, fancy meal and leftovers. 

on the other, i’m worried about how expensive it was, where that money comes from and the possibility of the driver being responsible for it, even though he did his job and did it on time.

i guess my question is, will the driver have to pay for the meal or does it come out of the restaurant? will he just not get paid for that order? i know they are reprimanded if a customer reports that an order didn’t arrive when it did but i never reported anything. do i have a moral obligation to get in touch with someone at uber to see if i can pay it again?

so after cancelling the order, the next day ubereats charged my card for the order saying the food was already made. i send in my receipt to show that not only did i pay for the food, but the address and time matched the timeframe and restaurant i ordered from. they told me their hands were tied and to call the bank - which i guess is my mistake but thats literally the instruction the person on the phone told me to do.

the bank reverses the charge. no biggie. i hadnt used ubereats since then until today. i put in an order and everything looked fine. the order once submitted gave me a ""payment declined"" message which i thought was odd - so i resubmitted using the same card. it goes through fine. out of curiosity, i check my acct and notice it took out the amount for the order i just placed and a separate charge for the order placed a month and a half ago.

i tried to put in a help request via ubereats' app, and i cannot even send a message since it says the order was placed over 2 days ago, and the options for help for that order only gives me one option - ""this order was cancelled but i was still charged""

i've searched everywhere and there doesn't seem to be any way to contact ubereats directly outside of the app unless i put in a help ticket for the order i just placed - which i dont want to do because that delivery went very well!

is there a way to handle this that i am overlooking besides going to my bank again with the pics of the receipt i happened to take or am i just out of that amount?

thank you!",2024-07-25 14:07:55,0,6,Reddit,UberEats

me: customer tip baited me and i want reimbursement.

me: i delivered on time, customer texted “thank you!” and she did not downvoted me, this is tip baiting!! connect me to supervisor

"driver said i needed to “confirm” the order being $30+ over the estimated total, then my order changed drivers? i’ve only used uber eats a few times, and this is my first getting groceries. it’s only 8 items, i scheduled ahead of time yesterday, and i left at least a 20% tip. around 11 am i was assigned a driver, and by 11:15 am it said that they got all my items and were in the process of checking out. then about half an hour later, they messaged me saying that the order ended up being $30 over the estimated total, and that it wouldn’t let them check out until i approve it. 

however, on my order progress page, it still said checking out, and had no notification about, or option to, approve the total being higher. i told the driver this, they said “right”, and then suddenly my order was placed back in the queue. my delivery time is now an hour later than scheduled and i’m having to reschedule some other commitments while i wait. 

what did i miss/where could i have missed a notification like that? or was this some kind of attempted scam?

"tip your drivers generously [edit: i am a customer. i do not work for ue or dd ] 
i have become a much more frequent customer of uber eats in the last couple of years. my hourly wage is high enough that if i have to take an hour to go to the store and come back, i’ve lost around $200. [edit: $100] i cannot emphasize how absolutely important you all are in this new economy.

i cannot do what i do if you do not do what you do.

i’m not sure if people actually realize the tremendous service and value that you all provide for us.

if i don’t have to leave the house for an hour and a half to go buy a quick dinner, that saves me a ton of money. it allows me to make money.

i tip at a level that shows the amount of appreciation i have for everything that you all do.

i think to myself “if everybody tipped an extra $10 per order and that person was able to complete 5 orders in an hour, that’s a damn good hourly wage!“ and you all are absolutely worth it. you do what you do because i can’t. i mean i could, but i’d lose a lot of money by doing it.

you deserve to reap the rewards that you afford me.

i think we need to rethink the whole notion about tipping drivers. we way underestimate the importance of your job. and it’s high time we fix that.

i do my part in communicating in public what an asset you all are.

i do my small part and helping change this industry.

i always send an appreciation text with an additional tips saying “i can’t do what i do if you didn’t do what you do. you are so appreciated!“

i already disputed with paypal and got my $75 back but posting here because it seems outrageous. how did he get my pin? we called through the app to figure out where he was and immediately after that the app says thank you for your order. i thought uber gave users an anonymous phone number, but him seeing my real number is the only way he could have gotten that pin.

"uber one cancellation issue caused uber a lost customer good morning  
i would like to share a story about uber one subscriptions and the shadiness behind them. for background i use uber eats about once a week. my story starts on monday of this week when i received an email from uber one indicating my credit card has been charged for the subscription.... when using the uber eats app i am always very diligent when checking out as they like to slide in the free trial for uber one before you confirm your order. i want to state **that i am 99.9% sure i did not sign up for the trial**.

i ended up googling my way to the cancellation page for uber one and was unable to cancel it due to ""being within 48 hours of the renewal period"" (they for obvious reasons make this very difficult to find - i have read on other reddit posts). i ended up opening a ticket with customer service and they where of no help at all. playing very dumb, and giving me the run around. they said that they could not locate an uber one subscription under my account, i then told them that my credit card had been charged and i received a confirmation email for the charge from them. then they started asking for:

* first 6 digits of my cc
* last 4 digits of my cc
* amount of the charge
* date of the charge

they also wanted a screenshot of my online banking which i outright refused. i told them this is a breach of my privacy and the bullets above should be more then enough to resolve my problem. customer service then said that the email address i am emailing from does not match the one on my account (to make a long story short i switched email addresses years ago and my gmail forwards to my new email):

>hello \[name redacted\],

>while reviewing your concern, we noted some common identifiers with your account and the account that incurred the charge.

>before we can go ahead with our investigation, as mentioned earlier, please confirm whether you know an account that shares your first name and is associated with the email address \[my gmail address, masked\] which our privacy notice permits us to let you know.

>if you recognize whoever used your card and would like to unblock the payment method, please let us know. if not, we recommend that you follow up with your bank or card issuer to request a new card.

>we appreciate your patience and understanding in this matter.

i did mention that i still own the email address to them but it made no difference and they sent me this email twice in response to ""yes, [blahblahblah@blah.com](mailto:blahblahblah@blah.com) is my email address"" and ""no, nobody in my family has been using my uber account. please cancel my uber one and refund me."":

>i’m sorry to hear about the confusion here, but i’m happy to help clarify \[name redacted\].

>based on similar reports that we’ve received in the past, charges like those you’ve described can occur due to the following common causes:

>- a family member or someone you know has access to your device.

>- a family member or someone you know has access to your login credentials.

>since these common causes don’t always involve someone illegally obtaining your uber login information and may be due to a miscommunication, we suggest reaching out to anyone who may have access to your device and making them aware that they are using your payment method.

>if there’s anything else i can help you with, just let us know. we’re here to help.

i then told them:

>no problem. i will never use uber again and i'm calling visa right now to have the charges reversed. my account has not been compromised, and i have provided all the necessary information.

> have a nice day.

"[serious] we should start a class action lawsuit against uber or a union for drivers rights. hi! im sure a lot of you are very upset with how things have been going on with uber eats delivery driving as a sustainable job. i have been a driver with over 3500 confirmed deliveries,  overwhelming positive feedback from both customers and restaurants, and have been delivering for over 2 years, but lately, i have been getting fewer requests on my app, i have sat in my car for 3 hours at a time with the app only ringing once or sometimes not at all. even when i get requests they have been ridiculously low rates that do not pay the mileage and the wear and tear of the car at all. i am speaking of drives that pay $6 for over 14 miles or $2 for 3 miles. before anyone starts assuming, i live in one of the busiest and most populated/expensive cities in the united states, so yes, there are tons of deliveries and activity in the city throughout all hours of the day. even in the dead hours of 12 am all the way to 4 am there are deliveries being done at all times and i also work every single time in zones that have the most activity and are busy. i can prove it as well since i myself do not get deliveries but i see drivers all the time pulling into the locale to pick up deliveries as well as sometimes i stand inside the place and hear the application go off at all times and can confirm that they are uber orders being placed. i have worked well over 40 hours a week for a few weeks where i do not even get the minimum federal requirement of my state for my rate per hour and im sure some of you have the same experience.

  
with all that being said, i feel like a lot of drivers here are also people that have also worked in uber for many years that have not committed any infractions and have been putting honest and hard work whenever they start their shift. i want to gather as many people as we can with as many resources as we possibly can gather to get a call of action against uber. we will need tons of evidence of wrongdoing and false flagging of our accounts, bad trip request as in ridiculous rates that do not pay us a fair wage and any legal advice/action that we can take. i think this whole thing has gone a bit too far at this point as i keep seeing distaste of people working for this company as well as i have talked to local drivers that also have express distaste for the things that the company has done.

the place that i've found pays minimum wage (£8.60 for me)/hour + £1,00\~£1,30 per delivery (depending on the distance). they cover relatively a huge area of the city, so if i deliver to the region that the pizza place is at, i get paid £1.00, and if i delivery to neighboring regions, i get paid up to £1,30 per delivery.

my question is, is there an actual rule the restaurants are meant to follow (when you report it it has a received substitution option so it seems regular)? and which do we prefer? as a picky eater, usually the substitute doesn't jive for me. but then i feel bad when they've given more than the cost in a replacement. is something better than nothing?

well, anyway, since the uber eats app is depicted in great detail in the manga, i am trying to get the exact german translation. ""so get the app yourself and look it up!"" some of are already shouting from behind. my friends: i would do it, but i live in austria and uber eats has withdrawn from the austrian market 5 years ago. or in other words: i can't use uber eats in austria.

* how was ubereatsdriver's service?
* please rate your ubereatsdriver
* ubereatsdriver is delivering/moving on his bicycle
* send message
* do you want to tip your ubereatsdriver?
* edit tip / change tip (that's the option where you've tip-options like 10%, 5% and so on and then you have the only option withot any percentage.)
* preparing your order
* expected arrival time

well, i hope this request is not too weird, but i certainly hope, that at least one person here has a good heart and can help me out.

"just reported an offer to the dol for misleading offers at this point, every time i get an offer showing like ""$40"" and i get to the restaurant, and they say ""this has already been picked up"" i've been escalating to a supervisor. if the supervisor hooks me up, it's chill. but today it was different. the first customer service agent cancelled the order without my consent, and when i escalated they did not compensate me past the $3. so i did what i told them i'd do, and i filed a complaint via the dol's website for misleading offers.

"thinking of being a driver and i have a couple of questions!  my main one is: can you see the address of the person you’re delivering to? there are some very sketchy places dt and i don’t want to go there at all, so if i could just like decline orders for there.. that would be great, but all the videos i’ve seen don’t show the address until after you pickup. 

2) also to go along with that, when an order pops up it says how far it is, does that mean the whole trip in general or just to the food place and then tells you after how far the place is to deliver to? i could try to avoid sketchy areas by only doing orders within a certain distance if i can’t see the address until after picking up the order

3) do i need an insulated bag?? the app doesn’t mention it anywhere 

4) i’m in canada, does it still say x amount of miles? or would it say km?

"uber vs door dash - comparing what they do to provide customers with a good experience i have a good job but have driven for both platforms  on the side for a little over a year, specifically to earn uber’s asu scholarship.  over almost 3000 trips, i’ve maintained 99% satisfaction and on time percentage with 0% cancellations = i try to do a good job for these companies and especially their end-users.  this is a long post because i tried to make it as comprehensive as possible…

what are the differences between these two companies when looking at how they go about quality control?  *note this is market-dependent but i am in a fairly standard situation = medium-large population and density with lots of orders but an excessive supply of drivers.*

door dash makes drivers input order numbers upon pickups from busy or poorly run stores to ensure the proper order was picked up.  uber does not.

door dash has pickup and delivery deadlines for drivers and monitors ontime%, including it in their driver metrics.  uber does not (for food, they do consider ontime for rides).  

door dash makes it extremely difficult to unassign from an order, and automatically deactivates drivers that fall below 90% completion rate.  uber allows drivers to unassign without hassle nor consequence (choose “excessive wait time” the second you arrive and you are off the hook).

door dash allows drivers to rearrange the order of stacked deliveries and contact any of the customers immediately upon dispatch.  example - i get a double with one of the pickups involving ice cream.  i can deliver the ice cream first.  uber not only won’t let drivers change their routes, you are also not able to contact the second or third customer until their delivery has begun.  this includes receiving messages from customers - a customer might have sent me a text to grab a couple hot sauce packets, but i won’t get it until i’ve picked up *and* delivered every order in the route before theirs.     

door dash will pay drivers an additional $1 to confirm all items are present before accepting an order at pickup from restaurants with a track-record of missing items.  this often involves making the restaurant open up the sealed bag, point out each item, and then resealing the bag.  uber does not, and as you know, after a refund or three, they stop reimbursing customers for restaurant mistakes. 

door dash prioritizes drivers with top satisfaction, ontime, and cancellation stats.  despite their public focus on acceptance rate and platinum or top dasher tiers, i usually hovered only around 5-10% ar yet still was consistently offered solid orders based on my customer-focused stats.  there are zero benefits to maintaining high satisfaction, ontime, or cancellation %’s with uber, all drivers regardless of stats seem to receive the same orders.  i’ve seen uber drivers with abysmal performance stats consistently get the same quality and frequency of offers that i do.

door dash still does surge pricing - when orders are stacking up and drivers are scarce, you’ll often see $1-$5 premiums added to *all* orders.  uber stopped doing this a long time ago.  if uber does get absolutely slammed, they’ll resort to gimmicky nonsense like quests (ex: complete 10 deliveries for an extra $4 total).

door dash will send me a message if i appear headed in the wrong direction or am sitting somewhere for any period of time (like if i stopped for gas).  on uber, i can pick up someone’s food, drive all over the place doing deliveries for competitors for an hour before finally delivering, and never hear a peep from them.   

door dash usually has a much higher volume and density of market share and drivers in most markets = door dash pickups are typically within a mile or two away.  uber pickups are usually 4-10+ miles away when they are dispatched = much longer delivery times = colder food.

while i am starting to see hidden tips on door dash lately, it has been uber’s practice for quite a while to hide tips over $8.   you get nothing in terms of quicker dispatch/acceptance or driver care for any tip amount over $8 with uber.  in fact, if you placed an order with a lot of delivery miles, your order will appear like garbage until an hour after it is delivered when the full tip finally displays.  ex you tipped $25 because you know the restaurant is 20 miles away, uber will bid it at $10 (their $2 base + $8 of the tip).  $10 for 25 miles (5 miles to pick up + 20 to deliver) orders are junk and will get bounced around for a long time before some desperate driver takes it.  however, $27 displayed for 25 miles, while still not great, is much more likely to be grabbed quickly.  

the *one* customer benefit uber has that door dash doesn’t is the ability for the customer to remove a tip up to an hour after delivery.  they basically make it the customers’ responsibility to discipline their drivers.  even just the threat that this is possible is effective - i am probably a little more careful about doing a perfect job and especially communicating pleasantly on uber trips.  

tldr/summary - it might seem like i’m hating on uber, but they are the ones giving me a scholarship and i actually prefer driving for them because they babysit me way less and i have way more freedom to operate.  i’ve done 5x more uber trips than dd.  however, it is absolutely night and day how these two competitors attempt to service their customer.  while dd leans on their drivers a lot harder in terms of quality control/consequences, and often incentivizes drivers with extra money to provide good service for their customers, uber seems to have only one focus at this point - paying as little as they possibly can to *barely* get the job done.

i contacted uber, told them i was missing my full order, been back and forth with them today with my order number, receipt etc, it even shows delivered to another address that isn’t mine, and they’ve basically said “unfortunately we are unable to review your concern further” and left it.

1) how do you get paid? does ubereats issue you a credit card with your pay/tips on it to use, or do they direct deposit it to your bank account? also, what’s the pay period like? 

2) what do you do for filling out tax forms for this job? i’m assuming since drivers would be considered contractors, you’d have to fill out a 1099 or something. would you have any tips on how to save that money earned in order to not get screwed over by the irs during tax season? 

3) is ubereats the only delivery service you work with, or do you also work with others like doordash, gopuff, grub hub, etc? if you use more than one, what is your experience with all of them? and which do you prefer whether it be in terms of pay, customer experiences, or anything else that comes to mind?

"ubereats cheaper than deliveroo & justeat for groceries but not much else just decided to do a comparison of prices when doing a grocery shop between the 3 sites and the actual location price and thought i'd share just in case anyone is interested in the differences.

using the co-op as an example:

base co-op price  
ubereats always 10p more than store price  
deliveroo 20p more than store price  
justeat up to 30p more than store price

so all of their discounts as basically nonsense and just making up for them charging more for each item when all they do is supply delivery, and their fees at the end are just added extra, and then delivery at the end is also extra.

somewhere like starbucks they are all even with each other though still more per item than getting it yourself at your local location, but price per location varies a bit.

for takeaway restaurants however ubereats & deliveroo are coming out often 50p - £1 more per item than justeat, on top of what they already add on from the actual restaurant price which is at least £1.

for example my local restaurant doing bao buns and katsu curry, restaurant price 10.95, uber eats price £12.40. and all items are around £1.50 more expensive than the restaurant itself.

so basically what's the point in the 'fees' if they are already adding on lots of nonsense fees and addition prices to every single item, and why are takeaways so much more expensive now than actually eating out in the restaurant?

"ubereats drivers scammed me - anymore insight? yesterday i ordered ubereats. i was able to see the courier (a man in a car) on the live map view coming to deliver to my home (correct address specified), all was well.

however half way through his journey, it suddenly switched from a man in a car, to a woman on a bike and then instantly showed 'your food has been delivered', when it had not. immediately after the quick switch it displayed that my food had been delivered by the woman in 'record time'.

since my food wasn't here, i used the app to contact the driver, instead of the woman speaking, it was the man, at first he seem confused as if he didn't know who was calling him, but when i asked him who he was he said 'delivery driver'. i told him my name and address and he told me he just has 2 deliveries (and the addresses weren't mine), he also told me the people he delivered to 'confirmed it was theirs' (which is odd, because this is already assumed in a typical delivery and these things aren't discussed), after repeating this a few times, i realised he couldn't help me.

so with no food, i requested a refund from ubereats, which i received very quickly.

i also checked the addresses stored in my ubereats account, and the only address i've ever entered was my home address, so it didn't make sense.

i then viewed the receipt for the order and saw the address the driver had delivered it to was completely different. the address he/she delivered to was one of the 2 addresses the man had stated on the phone, but it was't mine. some fishy is going here - the switch from the man to the woman at the last second seems to be identity masking, bottom line is they stole my food but if anyone knows or has anymore insight this would appreciated?",2024-07-19 07:00:12,4,11,Reddit,UberEats

the original order was for $11 and i didn’t mind that because i was already near the taco shop and the delivery address was less than 2 miles away. because the app glitched the order was canceled by the agent and i lost out on whatever tip the customer would’ve given. i was given $3 for my time and effort and i’m still awaiting a refund for the $20.53 i spent of my own money and it’s been 48 hours! 

 the agent was very rude about it and basically told me tipping is not mandatory even though i didn’t cancel the order. i’m really considering not driving for them anymore. that’s the last time i try to go above and beyond. it also sucks they don’t value drivers and there is no way to speak to someone higher up to make a complaint. screw you uber eats! just venting here but it sucks donkey balls!

"ubereats and doordash algo are still stealing tips and this need to change - its just in another manners so - basically what they do is that - they will send the order with the minimum base pay possible in the system. aka : 1 $ no matter what millage

so , if you have an order that have good tip - it will look like its a good order - but in fact - the customer is paying for this - so basically - they pay us with customer tips and not base pay + tips ( extra )

  
what need to change is that we need to have a mininum delivery base pay per order , it just cant go under that - no matter how many driver is available -

"uber still abuse of tips to reduce their base pay ! pretty sure doordash does the same ! and this need to change ! 

because tips is suppose to be extra income and not part of the income ! 

  
what they do , in my market , is that they put the order with an amount an try to find who is willing to do this for the lowest amount - and that sound fair to me. 

  
but what is not fair is, that amount already have the tips include - so like this , the customer pay with tips for this delivery - not uber. 

  
uber have the right to continue to find the lowest willing driver to do his trip - but we need to have a base salary that cannot uber cannot be under that. 



it have to be base on 

the amount of  pick up and drop location 

the amount killometers

  
in cad $ - ( my market ) - the base pay per location should be 1.5$ and we should get 0.7 to - 0.8$ per kilo.

  
all this can be charge at the customer when they order and easelly manage

  
as you can see , i do not put time variant - as time waste is part of the game. 

  
and by hour is just not going to make it - i dont want to have my sallary drop because of all those slow drivers out there. 

  
and it need to be clear - it will never go lower than that as base pay -  and all tips is extra.

"why is there so much hate around adjusting tips? hey everyone,

i’ve been using ue for a while now, and i keep seeing posts and comments from drivers who are really upset about something called “tip baiting.” i’m genuinely curious – why is there so much hate around it?

from my perspective, the app allows us to adjust tips based on the service we receive. sometimes, i set a higher tip upfront to ensure quicker service, but if things don’t go as expected (like a late delivery or missing items), i adjust the tip accordingly. isn't this fair? 

i mean, we’re all dealing with rising costs, and sometimes it’s hard to justify a big tip when the service doesn’t match up. am i missing something here? i’m not trying to be unfair or cause any trouble, just trying to understand the other side.

then when i tell them i want a refund for my order that never arrived they tell me ""that's out of my control i have to transfer you to a higher level of support""

like what?? you just lied to me then.. wtf???

why is this company straight up lying to their customers??

my order does not show up in past orders even though it said it was delivered an hour ago, so i can not use the system to request a refund as one of the chat agents suggested.

no matter what i do, they keep giving me the runaround and even though i've ""reached the highest level of support"" they keep needing to transfer me to a ""higher level of support"" but those transfers never go anywhere. estimated time of 4 minutes for over 30 minutes.

if this agent i'm talking to now doesn't deal with.. oh, as we speak he says he needs to transfer me to a higher level of support. which will apparently take 6-12 hours... o.o

i was annoyed to say the least, but i did as i was told and canceled the order through support chat. however, since this was my first time ever canceling an ubereats order, it was only then that i found out i'd still have to pay a cancellation fee that seemed to be equal to my order subtotal. i asked if i could possibly get a refund since the order was unfulfilled. the chat directed me to a page that said refunds are not possible once the restaurant confirms the order. this led me to believe that had the restaurant workers just double checked their inventory before confirming the order, they could have just canceled it on their end, and i would have been able to get a refund.",2024-07-11 17:20:06,6,34,Reddit,UberEats

"so why doesnt my uber cash work as uber cash ive resently been visiting the states and have been using uber to get around alot mainly because i cant really drive over there and it has been working fine with a travel card ( basicaly a debit card but preloaded with usd so theres not conversion tax) and there hasnt been a problem ith getting a uber around the place but every single time i go to use it for uber eats it never works. no matter what information i put in or how much is on that card it allways just says some bs like "" there was an error "" and just refuses to elaborate. so what i then did was just directly put in ubercash or whatever which worked and did take my money but when i went to pay and selected ubercash to be on and to be the payment method it still didnt go though which is just either dumb or a opsie daisy. so i ask does anyone know why????",2024-07-09 18:22:19,0,1,Reddit,UberEats

i hate tip baiters i had an order today. it wasn’t a big order and it wasn’t far but the customer pulled the tip after delivery. no i didn’t do anything wrong. it was a leave at door delivery. no contact at all. thankfully i have a great memory and will not deliver to her again. yes i know too is optional but we are not out there doing this to pass the time. we are trying to make money to pay our bills. bottom line if you can’t afford to tip then don’t order delivery. peel yourself off your couch and go get it yourself. ,2024-07-09 15:14:25,10,12,Reddit,UberEats
"dealing with a double charge i’ve been dealing with an annoying situation the last few days with uber. 

i placed an order for costco through the app on the 30th because there was a 20% off promotion going on. i was charged the amount of the order and the tip separately. everything’s going smooth but there was an item out of stock. no big deal because in the past i usually get a correction a few days later. 

since we had a stat holiday on the first the original transaction didn’t show posted until the 2nd in my bank. 

on the 3rd i saw all my corrections for the tip as well as other apps. it will always show as a credit for the original amount then immediately after a debit for the actual amount charged. 

i saw the tip was credited then debited back with no issue but i was then debited the actual amount after the adjustment for the updated total.

my account still showed the original amount of $153.60 and showed it as purchase, not temp authorization hold.

my account when into the negative and i called uber right away and they said they only see the one charge of 135.60 and the other charge should drop off in a few days. 

i called my bank right after because i was concerned about nsf fees and they said it should be fine and to call back in 3 days if it’s not showing the credit. 

well it’s been 3 days and i see both charges still saying purchased. the new charge of $135.60 doesn’t even show correction like the others do. 

i called my bank back this morning and they confirmed it looks like a double charge and wanted to transfer me to have it charged back. 

i was concerned if i go this route my account will be banned which i don’t want to happen (i just paid for the year subscription because it was 50% off not to long ago)

i called uber support back and they are still swearing that they only see the one charge of $135.60 and the other will drop off. i told them my bank had said it was showing purchase and wanted to do a charge back. 

the agent told me she will have this escalated and sent me an email with information to fill out and to include screenshots of my bank. 

now that i’ve done that i’m getting stuck in an endless look of agents sending copy and paste messages saying the charge will drop off. 

i feel like i’m stuck right now and don’t know how to proceed. ",2024-07-09 12:43:08,5,5,Reddit,UberEats

"ubereats has possibly been stealing from me, anyone else have this issue? i have been an uberone member for over 2 years and order quite often (multiple times per week) and never really checked my bank statements compared to my order history because i never really felt the need as i have a good idea of how much money i have spent just looking at my balance.

sunday i placed an order as i usually do and monday my account balance seemed off when i checked so i decided to actually look at the statement for once and it showed 2 separate orders from ubereats for different amounts pending. i go check my order history and no order matched that dollar amount and i went back 3-4 months worth of orders. ubereats chat feature and customer support is terrible unfortunately so i had to contact my bank to get it sorted and get a new card because my initial thought was that someone got ahold of my card info and was ordering for themselves. then today i log on to my banking app and see yet another pending charge from an ubereats order. i placed no orders yesterday or today. this was after i cancelled my card already and haven’t updated to a new one in the app. 

in the process of doing all of this i went down a rabbit hole of comparing my ubereats order history with my bank statements and found an excessive amount of discrepancies in the last 3-4 months alone: duplicate charges, orders i didn’t even place, etc. i have no idea how much money has been swindled out of my account and whether uber is to blame or not, but given that i had cancelled my card yesterday morning and didn’t have a pending charge yet and then wake up today to a pending charge from yesterday i can only assume it is uber themselves charging me for nothing because my new card is in my apple wallet only so no other person could have gained access to its numbers so quickly. if it was a person that just had my old card info the card would have declined. apple pay transactions still show as a card transaction on my bank statements and that’s what was used. 

has anyone else experienced anything like this? i know it sounds very accusatory but the facts are the facts and i’m not sure what i should do considering the amount of money that has been siphoned out of my account from ubereats charges.",2024-07-09 10:27:15,5,19,Reddit,UberEats

after the declined call was when i actually noticed the doormat and honestly i don't blame them for not wanting to return to that house, i wouldn't want to potentially get shot over retrieving a stupid food order either, but refusing to communicate with me is just crappy. zeroed the tip and sought a refund. i'd have left the tip if they at least answered the call and apologized for the mistake but this seems like yet another driver that just doesn't give a crap.

i've been easygoing up until recently, but i think this is wrong because it's taking away from other drivers and it's also putting me in a weird position because my order is half ruined from him taking the best part of 2 hours to get it to me (that was the worst time and my final straw). the place will bag everything ip and then it'll just sit there waiting for him. the other day frozen items were ruined and i was unable to get a refund because it then said the order had been cancelled?

i believe he takes a long time because he's accepting the orders off multiple accounts, but is only one person so takes ages to fulfil them. i am aware that ubereats does not care, as they allow for people to deliver on behalf of others, but i don't know if they necessarily allow for this. what do you think is happening here? is what he's doing allowed?",2024-07-08 12:18:39,13,24,Reddit,UberEats

"i'm getting more orders on ue and dd after doing this so like most or maybe not like most i have been struggling to even make $50 with ue and dd running at the same time. somedays i wouldn't even get 1 dd offer. i had just about given up with dd. so here's what i did to fix my problem. 

the problem was my phone. i have a s24+. i'm not sure if this first step is needed but this is what i did. 

first i factory reset my phone. 

second after it was all set up i deleted or disabled every app i didn't use or need. 

third i went into settings then apps and manually turned off allow background usage for every app except important ones like google stuff. 

i also turned off bluetooth. if you check in running services it has like 13 services running.

so basically i think there was too much stuff running in the background that was making uber and doordash get killed by my phone.
 
delete all apps you don't use have never used. disable apps you never use that you can't uninstall. turn off background data for every app except important ones. 

after doing this it was like night and day. i did this during a shift and i though maybe it was because it was lunch time it got busy but the fact i was getting doordash orders again it couldn't be a coincidence. since i've done this i've made over $100 everyday compared to if i'm lucky $50. plus my doordash is working again.

"why are restaurants showing on my uber eats but not my bf’s? me and my bf were both on uber eats looking for restaurants to order dinner from. i get restaurants come up that are quite far away and they will deliver to me. however, when he pulls up the same restaurants it says it’s too far to deliver. we thought it might just be a glitch so we ordered from one of these restaurants via my app on friday night and they delivered it. why is it different for both of us?

"accident question i recently got into an accident where i was at a stop sign and 2 other cars crashed causing one of the cars to hit mine from the impact. i have insurance companies calling me. i already had contacted uber about the accident. i was in the middle of a delivery and had not dropped the food off yet.

 i see so many mixed things about accidents. i am honestly not sure what to do. i was considering talking to a personal injury lawyer about getting checked up because i've been having headaches since the crash. i also want to make sure my vehicle is fixed properly. the injury lawyer told me they don't really deal with the repairs but i just would like to make sure my insurance doesn't go up and that my car gets repaired properly.

 from my understanding since i was in the middle of a delivery uber has some insurance that would cover me? and also i was not at fault so possibly the at fault parties insurance will beresponsible? if anyone has experienced anything similar please let me know.

"how do i go about reporting an uber driver who stole my food and is abusing the system? i ordered some dinner using uber eats for my friend and myself.

the original driver picked up my meal, before kicking (or passing the order along) to a new driver, taking my food. this way he won't appear in the system as the driver that delivered.

the new driver and the restaraunt confirmed that the food was taken. the restaurant was thankfully very understanding and remade the meal and i got the meal albeit an hour later. 

i remember the original driver's name thankfully, and of course, the area he drove around.

i tried to report this incident but the uber help centre doesn't actually have an option for this. i emailed the uber's business email as it was too late to call. they replied telling me to use the help centre and that they can only reply to business enquiries. i then got a refund following their instructions, but still no way to report the thieving og driver.

driver picked it up, took an extra 30 minutes after latest delivery and then reported they delivered it with a picture of it in their car and the gps still showing them 10 minutes away. i was suspicious cause they delivered it 10 minutes earlier than the 4th estimated delivery time, and my cameras also didn't see a car or someone drop off food.

i then tried calling them only to go straight to voice mail twice and then contacted support only for them to say they didn't follow protocol and refund the order.

wasted 2 hours waiting for food only for the customer support to be more concerned about me leaving a good review for them rather than a driver stealing food.

i log into my app - then i receive an pop up that give me a 50% off for 45$ max . 

i go great - and then proceed to shop a walmart order - all was fine the coupon was apply in the preorder price and all - and then when my order arrive - i look at my total and was charge the full amount . i just did not understand why it happen , but i see that the coupon was not apply , so i go back into my account and the coupon was just not there anymore.

i try to contact the support team about it - but it was not possible to have anything from them as they need the screenshot of the coupon that was just , not there anymore . 

so now - when you use coupon for the uber app , you need to screen shot them as they might just vanish from the app - and the remedy to this will be to receive an email when we place the order , so we have the proof. ",2024-07-05 03:00:02,0,2,Reddit,UberEats

so i messaged support and they told me i had to select the item twice for it to be applied. i then tested it in the app by changing the quantity to two and the price doubled with no reduction in price in the final checkout. there was no other option, and the listing for regular whopper at regular price was unavailable. 

so i’m confused. did i mess up or did the restaurant?

" clicking ""cancel order"" = ""please rob me"" button. here me out had an experience recently that has finally sworn me off ubereats for good. i had been ordering breakfast for me and one other person and foolishly decided to use the ubereats app to do it. immediately after placing my order i noticed i made a mistake on one of the orders. i then call the restaurant and inform them on my mistake and the employee who answered assured me that they had yet to begin making my order and that he's unable to cancel the order from his end, but that i should be able to cancel it and re-order. 

  
so i did that thinking everything will be okay, and expecting the then pending payment to be canceled and awaiting the money i had spent to automatically be charged back onto my card, you know like what happens in a regular service. i mean what else should any normal individual expect to happen when they're ubereats app is telling them that they've successfully canceled the order.

  
so i wait a day, no refund issued yet, but i'm sure it will happen soon, second day comes and goes, still nothing, but it sometimes takes a while, i'm sure i'll get it eventually. day 3 after i ordered and now i've become suspicious. so i go to the ubereats app and speak to live chat and i explain to them my issue only to then be told that i will not be receiving any refund and the reason they gave me was that ""it has been 48 hours after i have ordered and they can't give me a refund on the order"". and i'm sitting there thinking ""????"". what do you mean i can't refunded cause 48 hours have passed? i expect the charge to be canceled and a refund to automatically be processed the moment i click your ""cancel order"" button, like what happens at literally any other normal business. 

so what tf then is the point of a ""cancel order"" button?

and think about it, the only way they would've ever even potentially honored a refund at all is if i had contacted them prior to 48hours. and the only reason i know this info is because i actually decided i would contact them. had i been like the majority of people and not contacted them at all, and assumed hitting ""cancel order"" would eventually refund me, uber would just stay silent about it, pocketing the money while i'm stuck indefinitely waiting on that refund that will never come.

and the kickers here is that you are literally better off not canceling the order you've made a mistake on, as once you press it, not only will you not be refunded, but now you won't get the food you ordered, cause again, you've just cancelled it.  at least by not canceling, i would've received something for the money, but now i've spent \~$40 for literally nothing in return. money just out of my wallet and into thin air(aka uber's pockets)

"i hate when restaurants start asking me questions about the order i go to pick up an order from this korean bbq place. pretty decent, $15 for 8 miles. one lady was about to hand me the bag. then some other women starts asking me what kind of protein did they want with their fried rice. hell, i don’t know lady, it just says fried rice.

 she then says hold on a minute. i don’t have time for you to fumble around. if it’s that big of a damn deal call the customer yourself. i wasn’t going to wait 15-20 minutes for them to cook something else when the food was already bagged smh.

"uber eats has removed the option for me to receive food deliveries and refused to fix it.  https://preview.redd.it/36w4czf7edad1.png?width=1179&format=png&auto=webp&s=8075494714abeec37209ab6069c11fdb7e2ad8e7

when uber rolled out their new package delivery option ""connect"" at the start of june, they removed the option for me to receive food orders. the picture i have attached shows that the food delivery box is missing from my account. 

the option for food deliveries appears for me only on sundays and tuesday mornings. it may appear at the start of my shift, but i have found that it can vanish again mid shift. 

i am in los angeles and i deliver on a motorcycle. i have a 95% rating and have never had any complaints. prior to this i have a held a platinum status. 

  
i have run experiments. i managed to leave myself online for 17 hours in the middle of a busy restaurant area and not receive a single ping. weirdly, it allows me to be online well over the legal time limit. 

uber support have been extremely frustrating. they continuously tell me they have escalated my issue to a dedicated team. after 2 months of being told this i have come to the conclusion that this team might not exist. 

they seem to hold no records of my past interactions with support. each time i reach out , i have to start all over again explaining my issue. even more frustrating is the fact they close any ticket after a few days by sending the same cut and paste response about updating the app or turning it on and off again. these kind of responses show that they aren't understanding my issue.

  
i have allowed uber support to record my phone screen while i walk them through my app settings and prove to them that the option to get deliveries has been removed. they will admit that something is wrong and promise to send my issue up the chain. i then hear nothing. 

no one at support has ever delivered on their promise to reach back out to me. when i call back they can't tell me any dates about when my last inquiry was escalated. 

some of their responses are just ridiculous. i will send them a detailed message with a screen shot explaining how the food delivery box is missing and my reset button is deactivated. they will respond by telling me to tick the box that is missing and hit the reset button that isn't functioning. 

the worst part about this is all the hours i have wasted riding around believing uber that everything is fine with my account. 

i have spoken to other riders on forums who have experienced the same issue. none of us have been able to get past the inept support system. some of us are risking losing our homes due to this. 

it is without a doubt the most frustrating customer support experience i have ever had. 

i am now trying to find any lawyer or journalist who is willing to try and shake this case up. uber shouldn't be able to play with our lives like this.

"drivers: beware of this uber pro card scam # actual specifics of the scam and how it works are in bold.

i usually turn down most offers for mcdonalds, because . . . well, that would be a really long post if i had to list all the reasons . . . but if the price is right, sure, i'll take a mcdonald's offer.  **i received an offer to pick up a mcdonalds order for $20, 2 miles total trip.**    i was surprised to see that it was just a large sprite.  i've had orders for just a drink before, so i'm thinking that the offer is $20 because they are out of sprite, so drivers were canceling the order, so i'm like ""big deal.  i'll just pick up a sprite at burger king and explain it to the customer.  they will probably tip extra for going above and beyond.""  **when i arrive at the restaurant, i get a phone call.**  **i should have known it wasn't uber.  the accent was american and the comp was too high.  also, now i know that they almost never call us.  you have to call them.**

**the person on the line tells me that they are uber driver support and the customer called and said they had put in the wrong address and that i needed to cancel the order through the app but that i would receive a $20 credit.**  (usually, it's just a $3 credit, but the dude sounded official, so my greed led me to cancel the order, when i should have just fulfilled it and let the scammer be out whatever they paid for it, even though it was most definitely a dummy address).

**but the credit wasn't showing up in my** **drive**r **app, so they said there was another way to send my credit.  they asked if i had an uber pro card.**  **i'm thinking 'that's not really their business', but i tell them yes.   immediately, i know it's a scam because the second step (after ""go into your uber pro card app"") is to tell him the balance of my account.  i ask him why he needs that.  he rattles some jargony spill and then asks again for my balance, to which i say i'm not comfortable providing that, so he says ""that's okay, we can still continue with the credit.""**

**i play along because i want to give a full report to uber so they can cancel this account**.

**he tells me to hit the minus sign with ""move funds"" under it.    i ask ""but isn't that for moving funds out of my account?"" he says it will make sense when we've completed the credit.**

**basically, they ask you to add a credit card to your uber pro bank account (they provide you with the credit card number, which they say is the gift card that will add the $20 credit to your account. )   and then they coach you to the next step, which is to type in the entire balance of your bank account and put that balance on that credit card.**  i know what you are thinking.  ""who would actually fall for that?"" i think that perhaps a young person with english as their second language would be vulnerable, or if you are just a very trusting person in general.  the scammer did sound very official at first.   as one redditor in the comments said, a lot happens on the road and we can become distracted, and overwhelmed by the constant influx of trash offers. 

**even though i thought it was obvious that i was on to him** (**i mean, he hung up when i tried to put him on hold (i wanted to get him on a call with law enforcement)),** **he still tried calling me back twice to finish things**.   (why so persistent? )

**when i called uber to report the account, they said that they pretty much never call drivers and obviously, they always add credits to your driver account, never directly your uber pro card.** i felt dumb for not immediately knowing it was a scam when they said they were with uber; sometimes the greed almost wins, what can i say?

**i kind of wish that i had written down the credit card number that they gave me.  i could have reported it to visa as fraudulent.**

anyway, my driver (on a bike) messaged me and said he wasn't allowed to bring the order up. i thought that was strange because i get an order every couple of weeks with no issues about bringing it up and often the driver is on a bike. but, ok. i went down to get. i had no intention of reducing the tip. but, when i asked the woman at the desk if he was told he wasn't allowed to bring it up to me, she said absolutely not. she said she was waiting for him to say who the order was for so she could send him up. but he just dropped it off and left. the tip went to $3.

honestly thought it was a bug first and should be fixed at some point. but three months later i still don't receive promotions and offers. 

contacted support, and obviously it took me hundreds of messages to get the answer i wanted, which is that for some reason i have been picked for one of their experiments for 'improving' their offer & promotion experience.

so made the order at around 4:30pm from a take away store about 15 minutes away and was given an arrival time of around 5pm..

the driver arrived at the shop fairly quick around 4:40ish and app stated the order was ""wrapping up"" he then left the restaurant and started driving about 15 minutes away in the opposite direction.

first thought was maybe the shop was busy and he took another order first.

5pm comes and goes and driver is still 10 minutes away from the shop and app is still saying wrapping up... so i called the restaurant and they stated my food was picked up at 4:45pm by the driver... even offered proof via camera for me.

apparently the driver had food already in his bag ad spotted by the staff.

he then gets close to the restaurant and now it says on its way but still a good 5 minutes away from the actual shop.

of course food gets here cold and soggy packaging i questioned the driver and he stated ""oh the shop was busy sorry"" 

uber support was no help as they stated he must be stuck in traffic and im not eligible for a refund.

i get to room 218 and knocked, no response, so i called the customer to let them know that i was outside of their room. he replied that he was actually in room 201. the room was a little further down the hall so i walked over and noticed the safety latch was used to leave the door slightly ajar.   i knock and there was no answer. the customer calls and tells me to come on in. 😐 i immediately tell him no, but he can come out and grab his wine so i can be on my way. he got a little aggressive and kept saying there are no rules saying i can't deliver inside of a hotel room and i need to bring the wine in the room. i flat out told him under no circumstances was i setting foot in that room and if he wanted his wine, he needed to come to the door and get it. he kept trying to argue so i just hung up and called support.

"drivers; be honest, if you see a higher tip on the order, does it reflect in how you hand the order? now be honest guys

this is a follow up to my last post about getting rid of the tip edit. 

so drivers, when you get a higher tip on an order do you treat it differently than orders with lower tips? do you do things differently like be extra careful, or drive with the ac low? 


my honest answer, yes. may be messed up but when i see someone sees my value and appreciates what i'm doing, i want to go above and beyond to earn that tip vs seeing a 2$ tip that says they are only doing it because they don't wanna be that person that doesn't tip but doesn't want to actually spend any money. i see they really don't appreciate me making their day a little easier and battling the traffic, and terrible drivers on the road so they don't have to leave their house to get some yummy food. but those are just my opinions. at the end of the day each order does still matter and is treated with respect (just different levels of it) that is why i write thank you cards with every single order. 

i'm very curious to see if other drivers do the same or if you just treat every order exactly the same, or don't give two craps about anyone's food (really hope the last one isn't anyone's answer lol)",2024-06-30 07:35:55,12,110,Reddit,UberEats
"instant payout never arrived - has my money just been stolen? i finished some deliveries and added my paypal account and then did the instant cash out. the money never arrived in my paypal. i looked through my payment methods and somehow the paypal email address that it has listed in my payment methods section was different than the actual paypal account that i had just connected to the driver app. i tried asking for help but two different live chat reps responded with gibberish that had no connection to anything that i was even saying, each insisting that the money had settled in my paypal account (it has not). i asked the second rep to reverse the instant payout transaction and he told me to attach a bank statement and then immediately closed the chat before i could attach the document he asked for.

"uber cancels order while i'm picking up, tells me to keep food.  i accepted a pretty good offer at a local pizza joint last night, i went inside, confirmed the customer's name in the app, the restaurant handed the food over to me, i walked the food to my car, and when i went to the app to confirm pickup, the order was gone. at some point during the 15 seconds after i picked up the food and took it to my car, the order vanished -- i had the order open 15 seconds earlier so i could verify the customer's name. i called support and they mumbled their usual garbled broken english nonsense (i'm a diamond driver and they promise top tier support which is a joke). something about ""sometimes orders get canceled due to technical issues, the order has been reassigned now"". i said, ""why don't you just assign it back to me, i'm sitting here with the food."" she said, ""please just continue on with other deliveries, you may dispose of the food you have in any way you see fit"". haha. what a business model. i'm only posting this because after nearly 1000 deliveries with uber eats this is the first time this has happened to me. can't say i'm surprised, but good lord, how dumb is that.

update: i just got a message from uber telling me that they noticed i cancelled an order (uber cancelled it, i didn't) at the pick up time, and that i should have left the food with the restaurant, haha. i confirmed with the support agent that i ""dispose"" of the food and she confirmed it twice. oh, uber support. what nonsense will they think of next. these auto-generated messages are so dumb. i imagine a bunch of support agents at uber just bumping into each other, reading off scripts and waiting for their paychecks to arrive. i would call support asking about the message if i didn't know any better.",2024-06-29 14:15:27,17,29,Reddit,UberEats

"tired of ubereats, customer service is terrible. this is post for venting. i am really tired of ubereats and their stupid policies. 

1) the other day, i ordered an item for my friend in a different city (chicago). the driver didn’t even bother delivering the order. took an image of an entirely different order, from a different restaurant, that was already lying there in the lobby, submitted of that order as a proof of delivery and completed the trip. 

outcome: i paid an insane amount for the food, which ubereats claims was delivered (as per their policies) and hence it’s not eligible for refund. i paid for a delivery that never happened. 

2) today i ordered 2 items which included a can of coke. upon delivery, i see the coke can is missing. i file a complaint again stating my drink is missing. 

this is the response i get 

> after looking into this order and the information provided, it was determined that the delivery matches the order. therefore this order can't be refunded.
in addition, after reviewing your account, we’ve noticed repeated violations of our refund policy. we encourage you to review the uber community guidelines if there are further questions.

what did i do for that i get flagged for repeated violations?
 it’s not like i’m claiming refunds for every order i make (i order often and i have good enough history for that).

the complaints i filed are genuine cases where one or the whole is stolen from me and i still have to pay it. 

i think messing around with customers is part of their policy. might as well steal my money and call it a part of their policy.



edit: 
for case #1, here’s a little background. 

in my friend's building, there is a common food delivery point in the lobby where all orders are placed, and residents come down to collect their orders. the driver picked up the order from the restaurant and came to deliver it to my friend's house. however, the proof of delivery showed a random order from a different restaurant intended for someone else. the driver took a picture of an order that was already there and used it as proof of delivery, but my friend's order was never delivered. 
(my friend was tracking the order as well). it's absurd that the order in the picture clearly came from a different restaurant, as it had distinct packaging and the restaurant's name on it. you can't claim the order was delivered when the restaurant name in the submitted proof doesn't even match. yet, ubereats said otherwise.

"rant against uber eats background check i can be a state employee, i can work in my cities public school system, but i cannot work for uber eats.

i caught a retail theft charge in 2017 (stealing food from a kroger) and this has completely disqualified me from delivering. i had over 100 deliveries under my belt that could speak to my competency and i think that my credibility on the app should speak more than my record. i have completed over 100 deliveries and had no reports of food being stolen. 

has anyone else experienced this? maybe a different charge on their record has disqualified you? thinking outside the context of my situation, this is a job where there is not intimate contact with the public, as opposed to being a teachers aid in a middle school (which i have done), or a state employee in a library or museum, etc. my point is that this job, more than most, should be available to people with criminal histories.

frankly i think it is bullshit and a fraught attempt to lower the likelihood that a delivery driver steals someones food. i personally believe it is a huge moral distinction between stealing from a grocery store and an individual, but that is just my opinion.

when they dropped off my food they were eyeballing my security camera hard. glanced at it as he was walking up, set my food down, gave it a good hard 3 second stare, looked down at his phone, gave the camera another good hard stare and walked off. also they did not look like the person in the photo, maybe it was because they got a haircut, not sure.

anyways, i tell my mom to hold on and go to grab the food, but he would not let the bag go even though his arms were fully out extending it to me…  like we were both holding opposite sides of the bag for 10 seconds as he was just staring at me. i asked if everything was okay / if i was good to go, and he finally let’s go of the bag and just responds by asking what i’m doing right now and if i want to go to a bar with him? at this point i gave a nervous chuckle and said i was busy working. he then suggested dinner tomorrow to which i politely said sorry i can’t and hurried back inside (i had met him on my front porch steps after receiving several messages that he couldn’t find me even though the instructions said to leave it at the door). and yes, my mom was on the phone for this entire ordeal and heard everything. 

but things got even weirder after i got back inside. i peered out the window to make sure he was leaving, but he just stood outside leaning against his car staring towards the house (while also glancing at his phone at times) for about 10 minutes. he finally got in his car but sat in there for another 5+ minutes before pulling away.

tl, dr: scammer tried to call me and demand my information to extract money and also potentially hack my account, under the guise of being an uber eats support agent. never give anyone from uber any info outside what is necessary- uber will only ask for restaurant name, customer name, your full name, and/or your dob, as they apply, case by case. remember this, and you will never be scammed. safe driving",2024-06-24 20:17:22,4,3,Reddit,UberEats

after delivering, the total amount of $38.01 immediately showed up and it showed customer tipped $5.78. base fare shows $32.23! so uber paid me $32.23 for this order? order was only 2 items from a bar. i'm happy but at the same time very confused. ",2024-06-23 20:41:33,10,11,Reddit,UberEats

eta: i figured it out. it's a little hard to explain what went wrong, but basically there was a glitch where i couldn't see any chat messages and the chat window always just said ""pending"" and appeared empty. i updated my app, and now when i click on my chat history (far right tab > help), i can see my chats. they tried connecting with me with help multiple times and would message me asking if i was still there, but then they'd disconnect due to my lack of response. the final time i messages them they responded and said they'd refund me",2024-06-23 16:09:25,2,9,Reddit,UberEats
"drivers: general tips & tricks thread... feel free to add anything you think may help other drivers make better tips, money, save time, save fuel, and overall have a better experience...

i don't claim to know it all. not by a longshot. but over the past 2 years, here are a few tricks and tips i have assumed to be true. they work for me about 90% of the time.

**1. don't speed.**

go with the flow of traffic. or drive in the far right lane at or very slightly above the speed limit. no need to burn yourself getting a ticket. the time estimate on most ue deliveries has a +10% travel time - up to 8-minutes - buffer. uber's drive time is an estimate, taking into account stop signs, red lights, etc. it does not take into account any railroad crossings, though, so if you see a freight train, check the map for alternate routes.

**2. don't accept any delivery that has dollar amount** ***lower*** **than mile/km total.**

2 miles = $2+ / 10 miles = $10+. higher is better, of course. lower is gonna cost you. with gas being over $4.50 a gallon for the most part, even those of us in hybrids are aching at the pump.

**3. don't immediately tap the ""x"" cancel button.**

when you are given an offer that sucks (see #2), don't instantly tap the ""x"" to reject the offer. let the 10-15 second timer run through. because the offer on your screen is also showing up on 2-4 other drivers' screens. there's a chance one of them may accept the order first. if that happens before the 10-15 second timer ends, it counts as accepted by someone before you could accept it. if you tap the ""x"" it deducts from your acceptance rate percentage.

**4. check the order contents before entering the restaurant.**

on your accepted order screen, tap the order info box. scan what it contains. note any drinks, note how big or small the order is. if there's any hot food or just cold stuff. if you have a thermal bag, only bring it into the restaurant if you need it. this has saved me a lot of effort quite often.

**5. 8 minutes and walk.**

uber's policy on order pickup is... if the restaurant has not prepped the order by the time you arrive, if the employees ignore you or refuse to give you the order within 8 minutes of you arriving, walk away and cancel the order pickup. this is true of many pizza restaurants, a lot of fast-food places, and anywhere they are understaffed and overflowing with customers. just walk. don't waste your time waiting without getting paid. unless the order is a huge tip, it's not worth it.

**6. upside app is a scam**

what? what's wrong with upside? i'll tell you... upside only has the most expensive gas stations listed. they never list any discounted or member reward hosted gas stations. shell, mobil, amoco, bp, etc. where the gas price is 15-35 cents higher than the discounted places like speedway, thorntons, truck stops, walmart, etc. so their alleged 5 cents-25 cents per gallon refund makes zero difference, if you can simply use a less expensive gas station.

**7. do not swipe ""pickup complete"" until you are in your car.**

i have been able to get double or triple orders by *pretending* to swipe ""pickup complete"" in front of a persistent restaurant employee and - by the time i get to my car, i have a second or third pickup offer. this doesn't always happen. but a ""+1"" order that goes the same general direction and uses far less miles for a decent or awesome tip is worth waiting and ""faking"" that you swiped ""complete"" in front of the restaurant employee.

**8. hot restaurants may be worth taking low-paying offers.**

sometimes i get orders for restaurants that i know will very likely have a second or third offer by the time i arrive. in chicago suburb, johnnie's grill in melrose park is one of these. every morning and evening, they have 10-20 orders all at once. many of the orders are low or no tip, but at least half of the orders pay 2-3x $/mile tip. that means, sometimes taking a really horrible offer from a hot restaurant could double or triple you up with high-paying second or third offers.

**9. toll roads - avoid them!**

either use a secondary navigation app or get to know the side-roads around tollways. uber claims they will pay the toll as a fee to you after the delivery is marked as complete. but more often than not, they don't follow through. between jan and june 2024, i racked up $42 in tolls. uber gave me $5 for that. no matter what they claim, they are stingy and claim you were not legitimately on a drive for them when you used the toll road. they also try to have us use tollways for literally 1/2 mile - 1 mile then get off after paying 2 tolls for that tiny stretch of ""fast"" road access. in general, avoid them.

**10. park in a proper space - not near ""no parking"" signs.**

watch out for fire hydrants, avoid handicapped spaces, and even if there is a line of other vehicles with flashers blinking parked in the ""fire lane"" where abundant ""no parking"" signs are... do not follow their example. murphy's law will guarantee you a fire lane parking violation of $30-$50 per instance. if no parking exists, and the tip is not worth it, cancel the order with the reason ""can't find parking"". ditto for paid-only street parking.

**11. cancel any and all heavy item grocery pickups or package pickups.**

shop & pay, package delivery, gopuff, walmart, etc. if you have a pickup order that includes multiple cases of bottled water, multiple cases of soda, bicycles!! or huge, heavy items (menards - had a 100 lb air conditioner once), just cancel the pickup. unless you can lift all that stuff, and unless you are prepared to climb up to 5 flights of stairs carrying these  - multiple trips more likely than not - don't even try. just turn your back and drive away.

"sending ""thank you"" on stacked orders i like to hit the ""thank you"" for tip button when someone tips generously, i'm sure as most of you do as well. my question is (or maybe it's just more of a rant), when you do a stacked order where one customer tipped $12 and the other $2, is there a way to send ""thank you"" to just the first customer? lol i know there probably isn't a way, but damn it, i don't want to hit the button and send it to both. second customer can go kick rocks.",2024-06-23 12:43:55,23,22,Reddit,UberEats

$10 or more per order or i don't go out, and i drive back home after each order unless a good order comes up.

i keep the app on for 12 hours a day, and i only technically work 4 hours out of that day.i use the rest of the time to work on other things. so far i've been making $200 in that 4 hours that i work, and i make about $30 an hour on average now.",2024-06-23 11:36:14,68,46,Reddit,UberEats
customers should be able to lock in drivers that do a good job? might be stupid but i wish the customers can have the option of locking in the driver's after a delivery to avoid all the bs..if they aren't available then they aren't available but the drivers that are doing what they are supposed to do can get more offers...sounds good but a nightmare for the system lol,2024-06-23 10:28:31,38,41,Reddit,UberEats
"anyone ever done these guaranteed payout things? this is my first time receiving an offer for a guaranteed payout after x amount of trips. normally as a delivery driver i only take larger orders, like minimum $8 but i try to wait for orders of at least $10 or more. the $10-20 range is ideal for me even if it’s two trips bundled into one because i like to do less trips for a bigger yield. 

now uber sent me this offer of 170 deliveries for a guaranteed payout of $1270. some quick math says that’s about $7.47 per trip. so if i do 170 trips and only make $1000 that means uber will make up the difference of $270 yes? it’s not a bonus, it’s a minimum payout guarantee. that much i understand. 

so that would mean to maximize the benefit of this little program they’re offering i should take the shortest trips available that way i can do more trips in less time, regardless of the base pay or tip. it would be all about doing 170 trips in the least amount of miles to get the most out of this. i see why uber would do this because it incentivizes drivers to actually take those $2.50 no tip orders, although only if they’re low mileage. 

for those of you who have done these guaranteed payout promotion things - how was your experience? did you do many small trips like i think would be optimal? did uber pay you out in a timely fashion and did they give you a hard time getting your money? is this even worth it when i live in a high traffic area, high volume of orders almost every day of the week, and i am normally used to cherry picking my orders to do less orders for more money?

do tips count against the guarantee or is it just base pay? i doubt they would exclude tips. that would be too good to be true. 

i feel like this is just a scam to get me to take those small no tip orders and rush around doing lots of small trips. because the worst part about ubereats delivery in my area is the wait times in restaurants/fast food. the places just don’t seem all too keen on preparing and handing out mobile delivery orders. it’s like a chore to them and they take their sweet ass time while i’m trying to get in and get out and do my deliveries as fast as possible. time is money as a driver and while i do cherry pick and wait for orders that are worth my time, that doesn’t mean i’m slow or lazy. i try and get the order and deliver it as fast as possible so i can get on to the next order and make more money. i feel like this promotion defeats the purpose of that because instead of maximizing my dollar value per mile/per hour i’d only be concerned with the number of trips per hour and the amount of miles per trip to save time and gas to hit the promotions 170 trip mark. and if i’m taking more trips with less miles that means more stopping at restaurants and more waiting for orders to be ready to go. i feel like i’d just be waiting around. 

not to mention uber could give these offers out and then specifically not give that driver short trips. i mean they control what trips we get sent through the app and i could see them doing some shady tactics to make sure they get their moneys worth out of drivers using the offer. maybe i’m paranoid but i’m used to these corporations pulling shady moves like that on people.

"thank you customer! i'd like to thank the customer who made my day today. delivering food can sometimes take you a good distance from your home, by the time you're ready to sign out. today was like that. 

i was about 40 minutes from home,  when an order came up that was paying almost $40 to pick up something where i was,  and deliver it to my neighborhood. obviously,  i jumped on it.

it turned out to be a 4 pack of some kind of beer i'd never heard of, at a store about a mile from where i was.

i picked up the order,  and confirmed it, then started to drive towards home.  a few minutes later the order canceled. 

i lost the $4 tip, but i'm still getting the $35 delivery fee, and i have to get rid of the beer myself, because the store closed.

"shadow ban hi guys! it's strange that there's little information here about how uber lowers drivers' priority in the system as punishment for what it considers ""violations"".

what does this look like? usually, it's a reduction in the ratio of active time to online time, meaning the algorithm simply puts you in a kind of shadow ban and stops giving you orders. you can sit in your car for 6-8 hours, and either there are no pings, or just 1-2, and of course, they're cheap and shitty.

surely someone has found themselves in such a situation after canceling an already accepted order, ending up with customer food that they didn't pick up for some reason, significantly speeding, receiving several dislikes in a row, etc.

"driver demanded cash tip at door after i tipped in the app  i ordered a pizza from uber eats yesterday and added a generous $7.75 tip for the driver. 

when i answered the door the first thing she said was ""are you going to tip me in cash or...?""

i was like ?? i tipped in the app. ""no you didn't there was no tip on this order i only made $4 see"" and she showed me her phone which showed a $4 ""balance"". i tried to bring up the receipt on my phone but 1) it was not itemized and 2) the receipt was for $28, just the food, not the total of $35 i paid with the tip.

she didn't want to hand over my pizza and we argued about it a little, giving me a sob story about how she had to drive so far and almost broke her car getting here before i finally gave her a $20 bill, the only cash i had on me. at this point this pizza has now cost me over $50!! 

i was pissed and my pizza got cold as i tried to contact uber support. finally, i was at least able to adjust my tip in the app to a penny when i was prompted to rate my order, but i was asking for a $12 credit. the difference between the tip i ended up giving her and what i intended to give her. it sounds like they credited my account the $7.75 tho i don't think they understand what happened.

"random suspension & no consistent answer from support? what can i do? for ubereats, i used it almost weekly. for uber (rides), i never take trips over $10.00, and i always tip $5.00.

as a person with a disability, it was very helpful, and they often had the best deals and promotions.

maybe i used those too much?... but, they've suspended me, and i'm unable to use their service now. can't create a new account, because i only have one phone number.

they said that i violated terms and conditions, but they couldn't/wouldn't tell me which ones. like i asked several times, several different contacts.

they also said that they sent notifications warning me that i had violated terms and would need to correct my behavior, but i looked through my email history and do not have any such notifications.

i appreciated their service, and as a person with a disability, it was very helpful. it's deeply frustrating and just affirms that society really just hates people who are physically disabled. i don't know if there's anything else i can do?",2024-06-21 14:44:46,1,2,Reddit,UberEats

"why uber eats is pushing trip radar. it’s a scam. why i think they're pushing trip radar. it's a scam.

i've been doing uber eats deliveries for two weeks now, so sorry if this is already known. lately, i've noticed uber is pushing a lot of trip radar gigs. i wondered why, since regular trip requests seem to work fine. it doesn't make sense for drivers.

then i thought about it from uber's perspective. they want to improve delivery times and lower costs (for our cut, not uber's cut).

first, trip radar doesn't show the map, just the addresses. so, unless you know the area well, you might end up taking bad trips you wouldn't usually accept.

second, trip radar sends the gig to many drivers at once, making us compete for it. regular requests go to one driver at a time, giving us about 10 seconds to decide. when it's a bad trip, and multiple drivers decline it, those seconds add up.

(i also think there's a psychological trick here. trip radar might make us feel like there's always competition, so we accept bad trips for fear of getting nothing.)

**tl;dr:** uber eats is making changes that make our job harder and more stressful.",2024-06-20 20:50:03,15,33,Reddit,UberEats

another time an agent said something similar but said it would cancel on its own since it got declined. i pretty received one of two variations of the same copy and pasted message during every chat session. well forgot to lock my card and it charged me again (i guess it just keep trying every day which in itself is nuts). 

so i contact support again for probably the 5th time. this time the agent didn't pretend to not see my membership at all. he immediately addressed the issue and said he would cancel the membership (something the other agents claimed they couldnt do) but i would still have it for the month. i said no, i wanted it canceled and refunded and showed the screenshots of the other messages. pretty much after all of that, he puts me on a hold ""to see"" if he can issue a refund, in which he eventually did. but it was just crazy to see the tactics their customer service department is trained to use to steal your money

i'm currently on vacation in a state park. to get into the state park there's a $10 fee. when i made my order, the 25% tip was like 9.50. i put the tip at $20 and made a comment in the delivery instructions that i set it to $20 due to fee to get on the island. so even deducting the $10 fee, they would still be getting a tip of over 25%.

in the chat, my driver asked if i could increase the tip again due to the fee. i explained why the tip was so high and he again asked if i could increase it again. 

i felt uncomfortable because he kept asking so i ended up getting ubereats to give the order to another driver. 

how does uber handle fees like this (are they reimbursed or reflected in the amount paid)? can drivers see delivery instructions before they accept the order? and was my tip appropriate?

edit: i see now that i was in the wrong and i will not be doing this again. before i honestly believed that drivers saw the tip amount, distance, and address before accepting an order so i believed that the order just wouldn't be accepted if it was too difficult. i see now that i was wrong. my intentions were good but i see that i was very mistaken. when my order was delivered, i gave the driver an additional $20 in cash on top of the tip in the app. we chatted for a bit and she told me that she's intending on using the pass all night to deliver in the park (it's a big thing with a lot of tourists). thanks for educating me so i can be a more considerate customer in the future.

"instructions on how to get your order cancelled by a driver. before contacting your driver, it's probably a good idea to see how many deliveries they have. those of us that have 4 digit deliveries don't tolerate much bs because we've been through the ringer a few times. a higher order count should also be an indication that we have some notion of how to do our work because you can't get that high without knowing *something.*

i'm 1/4 mile away from the the liquor store, which i took as an indication that there may be a reason others aren't taking it.

i immediately get a text from the customer: ""my son will be outside to take the box.""

as a general rule, i will immediately cancel any order that isn't something simple like: ""hey, i forgot to ask for chop sticks, can you grab some?""

i hop on the freeway and get to the store. i park in the lot and send a text to the customer: ""the app will require your id to do the order.""

his response: ""it worked with my son's id the last time.""

okay...

look, the rules of ue are pretty clear: we're *supposed* to match the name of the id to the name on the order, but we aren't the fbi. we know that there are shared accounts and fake names. it's pretty unlikely someone's given name is donkey face, i get it. just hand me an id, if it isn't blatantly obvious that it isn't yours, i ask no question, scan it, and move along with my day.

i've never had to return an id order. we can *low key* work it out at the door, but i draw the line at scanning my own id or entering fake information in the app (yes, people have asked me, but i'm firm on this). putting a blatant violation of the tos in writing is a step too far.

also note that ue is making certain things more difficult lately. it used to be easy to quickly override pins, but it's not possible anymore. i don't know if alcohol orders will be more strict on the app, and i'm not losing my account over this by even taking an order with *that* in writing.

today, on my new account, all of a sudden i received a receipt for an uber one subscription which made no sense. my new uber account is still running a trial, so i emailed support, and they said that the uber one charge was tied to my old account, and that they will not refund the uber one payment, and that it has been blocked on the system to ever be used again. they suggested that i should take this upon my payment issuer (paypal in this case).

for 1, this original account has already been deleted. it makes zero sense for them to be charging me on a now defunct account. secondly, it also makes no sense for them to block my paypal, when it's their fault for charging an account that is no longer active. now i am going through a paypal dispute.

tldr: ubereats charged an inactive account for an uber one subscription which was likely running on a free trial. bunch of scammers.",2024-06-17 22:14:48,5,7,Reddit,UberEats

"toll roads many of us live in or near a major city, which has its fair share of toll roads...

i live near chicago, which has 5-6 major tollways sprawling north, south, and west for up to 100 miles.

uber eats app does not have a method of disabling toll road use.

and before you start yelling at me again... i know, i know... some of you will say to use a different navigation app. i simply prefer to have it all-in-one, so i stick to the uber eats navigation 90% of the time.

that being said, i contacted uber support about it. i asked if there was a function to disable use of toll roads.. tl;dr: nope! it's hard-wired to push toll roads as the primary option for traveling through the suburbs of chicago, whenever possible.

for example: i-355 is a high-speed toll road stretching between elgin, il and o'hare airport. coming in 2025-2026, it will literally wrap around o'hare airport in a loop. (under construction right now).

there are on-ramps and off-ramps every mile or so... uber eats - whenever i am within 1/2 mile of 355 - will direct me to take an on-ramp and then take the next off-ramp. a 4 minute detour from the side street which would take 2.5 minutes instead.

i-94 is a north-south toll road that gets used the same way... i've had trips that could have taken 8 min on side roads, but uber navigation directs me to take 94 north for 6 miles, take an off-ramp, then turn around and get back on to go south for 1/2 mile...

in total, i have accumulated over $60 in toll fees in the past year.

uber support claims we are compensated for all tolls while on a delivery and while approaching the restaurant after accepting the pickup offer. that is a lie. i have received - at most - $10 worth of compensation in that same year of being directed to toll roads.

now, while i have lived in the suburbs of chicago for over 20 years, i am completely unfamiliar with many (most) of the suburbs and side roads. so many times i have no choice but to follow uber's suggestion and eat the cost of tolls.

and i'l say it once again: i simply prefer to have navigation and order info all-in-one, so i stick to the uber eats navigation 90% of the time.",2024-06-17 10:21:07,0,5,Reddit,UberEats

"how was everyone's deliveries go on father's day? went really well here in nj, was nice to see the big pay day with how slow it's been this week.

i went online at 8am this morning on both uber & doordash since i was able to get scheduled on doordash from 8am to 3pm, though i ended up dashing longer since it let me stay online cause it was 'busy'.

made out with $131.84 between the two. $35.94 coming from doordash with earn by time (i get more orders that way since my acceptance rating is so low). and $95.90 from uber.

biggest deliveries of the day were:

1) a double order from lowes & ihop. picked up a garden hose then someone's breakfast, delivered them both. second customer ended up tipping. $14.28, bringing the total for the two to $22.48. first order for lowes was the cheap order, i seen it show up on trip rader for $3 and change before it was offered to me for $22.48.

2) best order of the day was another double order both pickups from ihop. ended up paying out $32.42 with a $3.00 tip & $29.42 base pay.

worst delivery was to a store (which i won't name) dropped off an employee's breakfast to her. unfortunately the lid to her coffee cup for her green tea came loose in my delivery bag and when i picked it up from my cup holder, i handed it to her said 'here you go you can snap the lid back on, that way i don't have to touch it since you drink from the lid. sorry it came loose.' everything else was fine, nothing spilled. and...she removed her $5 tip, but didn't thumb me down. it is what it is.",2024-06-16 22:56:06,5,32,Reddit,UberEats
"stolen order got me thumbs down! this absolutely ruined my week and today which was also a very good day including bonus tips and even my first bonus cash tip.    so what happened is i got my first order, simple $8 for 5 miles...average order, then got an add on for $5 basically for an extra 1.2 miles so why not?   first mistake here is that i didn't notice the add-on order is basically in the slum area of my small city market,  aka absolutely wouldn't feel safe here at night.

2nd red flag,  i arrived at the restaurant and a staff member was confused because the order had already been picked up aka **stolen**, but they would remake the order so i was like sure why not, and delivered the first order which gave me a $2 cash tip bonus on top of the tip,  then went to the 2nd drop off with plenty of time to spare, and followed the instructions to the letter and dropped off at the correct address/apartment number even though i hate this neighborhood, its a high crime slum and **would never deliver here at night period,** for reference there was a murder in this area just 2 months ago and has known gangs in the area, if it was possible for uber not to give me orders to this particular area, i would opt-out of these deliveries all the time. 

on the way back to my busy area, i stopped off at a gas station to get a drink since it was hot and checked the app, i was greeted with another warning and that my satisfaction rating had gone down from 94% to 89% with another thumbs down, nothing was done wrong - period,  this time i contacted uber support and basically this story that someone could have downvoted by at any time during the week and its just showing up now story, aka but it looks fairly obvious the stolen order was what did it.

what is more annoying is that, afterwards i got two thumbs up and that only increased my rating back to 90% so it is heavily looking like the uber pro status is heavily stacked against the drivers to maintain especially if you can get a thumbs down at any time, for any reason, now i don't care about the tiers because in my area they are useless, i have no costco etc,  it is the principle that someone could downvote you for basically any reason here and uber isn't going to have your back is the worrying part for me.",2024-06-16 22:29:33,3,15,Reddit,UberEats

more and more i am running into other drivers who are waiting for orders at restaurants. 8/10 don’t have hot bags. they just pick up the order, hug it against them and head to the car.  my guess is it’s not going in a bag when in the car.  i wish it was mandatory.

this explains why my food is literally cold when i get it a lot of the time. i just assumed ya it’s delivery. but after seeing how hot the food stays when in a bag when i deliver it all makes sense.

these past 2 weeks have been really confusing and frustrating trying to deal with support. support pretty much ignores most of my responses and closes out tickets on me. i've taken to reaching out to them on social media to flag and i've at least gotten people who seem like real people who seem interested in flagging my issues only to get back to the black hole in support. i've tried to call the support number for ubereats only to realize they just file tickets in the app.

so i've gone through the ringer in terms of reasons... there's literally nothing wrong with my account, they can't replicate it, they thought some of my activity was suspicious and they've fixed it, to it'll be restored in 24 hours, and now ultimately somehow i've ""violated their terms of service"" but won't tell me what i did or why.

has anyone had any issues with anything like this? i don't think i've ever done anything wrong, the closest thing i can think of is that i tried to place an order for bourbon recently because there was a nice bottle in my area at a decent price, i told them not to substitute if it wasn't in, for some reason the drivers weren't respecting that and i had to reach out to support to cancel, but i've had order access one or two times since then. i don't mind using a different app or create a new account if not for all of the money i have tied up into this account. any advice would definitely be appreciated.",2024-06-12 16:44:20,2,2,Reddit,UberEats

"uber eats promo fraud (scam) - not honouring the 40% promos  
**tl;dr i was sent an email with the 40% off promo, but it wasn't showing up in my app. i contacted customer service about this and was told to make my order first and then contact them again after the order had been marked complete/delivered to have them manually apply the promo to my order. i did this and was basically told to go f myself by 4 different agents** 
i know i wasn't the nicest to customer service but i really feel like they were determined to rip me off and from the beginning they knew they weren't going to help. 


my question is, is this how is it legal to contact a customer directly to advertise and offer a (invalid) discount, then have a representative say that they can and will apply it despite it not showing up on the app (but only after i make an order), then refuse to honour any of this??? isn't this coercion and misleading advertisement and can i submit a complaint about this to the competition bureau?  


lastly, would my bank/credit card company be able to do something about the charge? i'm not even looking for a full refund, just the $10 from the still very valid merchant discount?

**original post below**

i just had the most frustrating experience with customer support today and am shocked at how this was handled. i cancelled my uber one subscription after they stopped allowing me to use promotions, and then stopped sending the promotions all together (this was after i had signed up for a 1 year subscription so that money went down the drain). months later, i receive an email with the 40% off of $40 on the next 5 orders promo they used to send all the time (coincidentally, i received this promo email today when my 1 year subscription expires). i clicked on the link in the email and it redirected to the uber eats app, but the promo wouldn't show up in the app. i contacted customer support about this and was told by the agent: ""i request you to reach out to us once your order is marked as delivered/completed, and we will apply the promotion to your order manually.""

so i proceed to make a $60 order. the merchant had a $10 discount that i chose not to use as i was told i could have the 40% off promo applied retroactively. when my order arrived i contacted customer support again, only to be told by a series of customer support agents:

1. ""for this promo, you have to place five orders and order up to $40"" (??????). when i told the agent this wasn't the case, i was told to just apply the code to my next order, despite me detailing initially that the promo would not show up in my app. i asked to be transferred to a supervisor. the agent declined to do so and then the agent ended the chat.

2. the next agent told me that i was not eligible for the promo as it was not added to my account. i pointed out that the email i received was sent directly from uber eats to my email, which is associated with only one uber eats account, states ""discount is available on your next 5 orders only. pickup orders excluded. **you must receive this email directly from uber eats to be eligible.**"" the agent told me she is not able to add/activate promos on customers' accounts so i asked for a refund of $20 to my credit card, which was denied and before she ended the chat. 

3. i went karen mode on the next agent and told him that coercing a customer into making an order by sending emails with invalid promos and having customer service agents reassure the customer that the discount from the promo could still be applied but only after making the order, was deceptive marketing and against the competitions act in canada where i am. he told me that everything said and done aligned with their policies and ended the chat. he said i could email them regarding the issue but never provided me with an email address, i haven't been able to find the email address online either

4. with the last agent i talked to before giving up, i only asked for the merchant promo for $10 off to be applied, as the only reason i hadn't used it was because i was told i could get a greater discount applied after making the order. he asked for a screenshot, which i sent him before be being told that the promo had been deactivated (it was still there and active until june 30th, 2024). he also said to ""keep in mind that, according to the terms and conditions, uber reserves the right to disable promo codes and marketing campaigns. you can still continue to order from the uber eats app."" before ending the chat.   
(i'm guessing he's saying that no promos will ever work in the future for me, but they will still graciously allow me the luxury of continuing to order from them after calling them out for fraud?)",2024-06-11 19:15:37,10,24,Reddit,UberEats

i know its not efficient having to park the car and walk into a building,  but i always boost the delivery person tip one level up for doing so, especially if its raining. it was also clearly stated in the order details what i expected. this delivery person's behavior really bothered me. she was talking to me like she was a victim of my instructions and how unfair it was for her. i don't know what she did but i did not walk outside to get my order. i gave her a bad review, zero tip and asked for a refund.

"toll roads... (rant) short version:

i try my damndest to avoid toll roads. uber navigation insisits i use them all the time. i avoid them purposefully, but...

today...

chickfila... $10 offer for 4 miles. sweet!

**not!**

it ended up being: a broken down semi truck on the off-ramp of the highway. the map directions (verified trough google maps) directed me to drive south down the non-highway main road, cross over the toll road highway - bypassing the drop-off spot marked on the map - then take an off-ramp and u-turn to get back on going north and return to the road directly opposite the drop off spot marked.

this meant i would double my distance, then have to cross on foot over an 8-lane highway overpass intersection, with the average of non stop vehicles going 50-60mph. and locate the guy stuck in a broken-down semi.

i drove by, saw nothing. looked up and down the off-ramps and on-ramps. saw nothing. followed the u-turn directions, looked again, nothing.

texted the customer. he said ""i'm by the chips pile""... uhh... what? (he meant a huge pile of gravel)

in the end, i incurred $13 of tolls to find the customer. in a construction staging area off the side of an on-ramp.

i contacted uber support. they said they will not compensate for any tolls not incurred as part of the delivery. i told them to check my driving to deliver this. they said no toll compensation.

ffs!

just checked the order. the broken-down truck driver complained and deleted the tip!

so i got $1.59 for the miles and lost $13 in tolls. + fuel + time + it caused the next 6 orders to be late. (i had pre-accepted a dunkin order and was scheduled for a walmart pickup for 5 customers).

-------------

there have been countless occasions uber maps has insisted i take toll roads... for 1/2 mile - 3 miles when an access or non-toll road is the same time or faster. i can usually bypass them. but this was... gah! yah know?",2024-06-10 14:33:51,0,7,Reddit,UberEats

however, every other time i got on with support, they refused to give me anything at all except for one other time. this recent interaction made me so angry. support flagrantly lied to me saying if i cancelled the order i took (which was already taken by someone else when i got to the restaurant) i would be compensated the 3 (wow) dollars for my effort.

however, after i cancelled the order, he practically admitted to lying and went back on his words when i cancelled. idk if anyone else in this sub drives in tallahassee, fl, but if you see this please let me know in the comments. anyone have any tips on how to navigate this?

"thumbs down is a huge problem for new drivers! i lost 10% satisfaction in one random down thumb rating today, my first one after 75 deliveries and i'm pissed because for the life of me, i cannot figure out what i did wrong.    i always check orders for accuracy to make sure the orders line up - i'm always trying to be nice to people, wishing people a good day etc -  i'm usually either on time or sometimes early - i always use insulated bags and generally, cannot understand what i did wrong today outside of being slightly late due to circumstances beyond my control - this should have been a good day as i hit platinum rating today and then discovered this on my account meaning that i cannot hit diamond until i get up to 95% and who knows how many deliveries that could take! 

here is the problem,  i've found that hardly anyone leaves a thumbs up - i've got 9 thumbs up and now 1 thumbs down which, you do the math is an 90% satisfaction drop just because apparently one person didn't like what i did,  the only thing i can think off today which was different was that i was 10 minutes late on an order because police had completely barricaded the road to the customer and everyone had to take a detour around the road block (house fire on the street) which caused me to arrive to the customer later than expected, food was still piping hot.

now, because from what i understand of ue satisfaction rating system......new delivery drivers are absolutely at the mercy of customers,  it probably wouldn't take more than a couple of thumbs down to get deactivated especially considering that more than likely you are not going to get merchants to rate you, nor can you expect the majority of customers to give you a thumbs up and i'd hate to keep asking customers to give me a thumbs up just to protect my account,  surely there must be a better way?",2024-06-08 22:33:21,19,43,Reddit,UberEats

"""adjustments"" in recipe so, long story short.  
i ordered from ubereats, because they offered minus 60$, and because they have been sending me notifications for the last few days... i thought why not

my original total was \~122.  
after some time, an additional $85 is charged from the credit card  
when i received my order, i start doing the math and everything was ok, except this ""adjustments"".  
so i wrote to the customer support, and they told me that ""strip loin grilling steak"" price has been raised, because of more weight, that's why i have this ""adjustments"". but i send them photo twice, with actual price tags and they just don't care.  
support was telling me, that 2 steak was 205$ (instead of actual price on price tags of 150).

here is the recipe:

tax section looks weird also, to be honest  
i still can't figure out what number they got the $11 tax from (13%).  
and the image of actual price tags.

"tips not being processed and my queries being ignored? so this is kind of just a rant post and i suppose it'd be good if someone can give me a logical answer/let me know if they've had similar issues ordering through ubereats. i'm not sure if it's just because i haven't ordered in like a year and the system has changed, or whether it's different here (canada) than in my home country, but yeah, i'm confused and annoyed at the customer service i got today.

so a few days ago i made an order, established a tip before paying, later received the order, and then got an update from my bank that the transaction amount had changed. it had changed to a lower amount, by the same amount as the tip i'd left.  
i reached out to customer service and they only told me how to change the tip.  
later the tip seemed to go through (as a separate transaction) so i wrote it off as a weird glitch or that the customer service agent had done something on their end.

today i made an order (to the same place too) and the same thing happened. order was placed with an established tip, received the order, the transaction amount changed (same amount as the tip), and so i went to customer service again.

i explained my issue and told them it'd happened before, gave them details on it, and asked if there was something in place where tips only went through after an hour or something because of the tip changing timeframe.

they gave me the same spiel as the previous agent (how to change the tip), adding onto this the option to rate the driver, and when i asked a clarifying question - 

""ohhhh okay so the tip only goes through if you rate them, even if you establish a tip prior?""

they then responded with - 

""since i have already provided you with the best possible resolution and there are no further resolutions to this issue and i do not want you to waste another precious time here with no resolution, i am now closing this chat from my end. you can write back to us if you have further queries. thank you for using our live chat service. thank you for using uber.""

this feels to me like they're saying ""stop wasting my time."" i just want to understand why this is happening, i'm not trying to waste their time!

  
now, an hour later, the tip finally went through, so i'm thinking it's as i suspected prior - it's based on the tip change timeframe.

but then why is it so hard to just say ""yes, tips are only finalised and charged after the tipping timeframe."" ??



in my home country we don't tip! so this makes me anxious to think about someone being promised a tip and not getting it. i never want someone to feel like they've been conned out of a tip :(",2024-06-08 17:45:55,1,4,Reddit,UberEats

"aitah??? bad experience at a high end resort bell desk…not the first time with this guy.

shop and pay from safeway.  11 minute drive to customer.  notes say leave at bells desk and let them know it’s for john room 498 (order placed by sam).

before i leave safeway, i message to ask if john will pick up from bell desk or if i should ask them to deliver to the room, because i know they’ll ask.  no response.

5 minutes go by and i message again asking for a response.  no reply

a few more minutes go by, at this point i’m almost pulling into the resort, i call.  no answer.  leave a vm.

get to the resort.  as soon as i see who is working the bell desk, i mentally prepare myself for attitude, which i receive immediately by him ignoring me.  i say excuse me and let him know it’s an ue delivery for john in room 498, which i have written on the bag.

he continues to ignore me.  so i  say excuse me again and he finally looks at me.  so i repeat, ue delivery for john in 498.  he tells me he needs a last name, which i don’t have and tell him that.  then he asks for the phone number, which i don’t have and i tell him that.  he asks for the room number, which i give him.  he tells me he can’t do anything without a last name.

i message the customer again and wait. no reply.  so i snap a picture, tell him again that it’s for john in 498 and start to walk away.

he yells at me to come back, so i do.  he again asks me for the last name.  i tell him the customers first name is john room number 498.  he tells me to do my job and get the customers last name.  to which i reply, i cannot force the customer to answer his phone.  he tells me, then maybe you shouldn’t do this if you can’t do your job.

i am now getting very frustrated and start to walk away.  he yells at me again that he’s going to throw it in the trash if i leave it.  so i walk back and calmly tell him it’s for john in room 498, call the room.  he finally does, customer answers, confirms order, asks for it to be delivered to his room, done…or so you would think.

as i’m walking away, he calls me stupid and hopeless.  my blood is now boiling.  i turn back and ask him what he said.  the 2 other young bell man are looking at me with sympathy, because they both know that i am super nice and friendly.  he tells me you need to know the customers last name and room number next time.  i just walked away.  as i was, he called me stupid again.

as i’m driving away, i called the resort management, explained what happened and said that something similar had happened before with this same guy.  she was very nice and apologetic and said she would have his manager speak with him.  i verified with her that their guests are not told they cannot use these services, that we are not allowed to deliver to the rooms, and my only recourse is to leave at the bell desk, who will contact the customer and make arrangements, or that the customer needs to meet me at valet.

"technical issues leading to issues not only have i experienced extremely poor customer service due to customer support not understanding how the ubereats app works from a customer's perspective, but technical issues with the app made my order for pickup vs delivery. which i had to take the charge for and place a separate order to delivery. they told me they have no technical support team or number for further inquiries and it's my fault for the issue. it's frustrating knowing they can't offer any fixes especially for long time members with an uberone, i won't be spending money with this app once my membership expires in a month.",2024-06-07 16:22:06,2,1,Reddit,UberEats

"priority delivery issue so, i know this has been asked a lot, but i wanted to get some clarity.   
  
i pay for priority delivery almost every time i order from ubereats.  drivers on here have claimed they can't see if someone has paid for priority delivery, while others have claimed that they've gotten more than one priority at a time. so it can't be both. while i don't want to call anyone a liar, i find the not seeing priority side a bit hard to believe. we can see where the driver is at all times on the map in the app, from the moment the order is accepted by a driver. the times i've not paid for priority, the app will tell me that the driver has picked up my order when i can see them, on the map, leaving the restaurant. and i can see that it says they're on their way, but may stop at another house first. if i don't pay for priority, i don't have any issues with that.   
  
but, almost every order i've made for the past couple of months, when i do pay for priority delivery, i can see the driver at the restaurant, then leaving the restaurant, but it'll still be on the, ""picking up your order"" setting until they go to another address, drop off that delivery, then mark my order as picked up and on the way. i've talked to one delivery driver about this when he delivered my order after another, and he all but admitted he was lying about not seeing priority when i brought up that i saw my order was not marked as picked up until the previous delivery was made. my solution to this is usually to call ubereats and have these drivers blocked from my account.   
  
before these past couple months, i'd only had this issue once, a few years back. other than that, i've always seen my order picked up and brought right to me. this is a very recent issue for me. so i'm trying to sort out if priority delivery is really a scam, or if the drivers in my area are gaming the system by not marking priority orders as picked up until they complete other deliveries. also, i always tip well. over 20%, so i don't think that's the issue.",2024-06-07 11:06:44,3,41,Reddit,UberEats

"$25 restocking fee ?! had the most disappointing experience being on the customer side of uber eats. so i ordered some items and it included alcohol which required id check. i tipped and provided clear directions to get to my apartment because it’s a new complex but easy to find the only thing is i live on the third floor and i made that clear. i see her arrive, she parks in front of the incorrect building but no big deal because it was right next to mine. i text her i’m the middle building and she says “i’m here can you come down and get your order.” i tell her “unfortunately i can’t come down that’s why i chose the meet at door option” and then she says “i cannot come upstairs i don’t feel safe” so in my mind i’m like you don’t feel safe ? why ? the suns out no one is outside so i called her and asked “what makes you feel unsafe” and she starts with “are you coming to get your order or not”. i told her “i’m unable to come down but i can’t stand outside of my door” and she says “ i’m just going to call uber support” and starts to back out of the parking lot. this scammer drives the order back to the store and returns my items cancelling my order. when i contacted uber support they tell me they have to charge me $25 for a restocking fee which is non refundable and there’s nothing they can do about it. im livid because not only am i charged for not getting my order while i am home and can fully see her in her vehicle but the driver has gotten paid for picking up my order and returning it back to the store ! why give me a “meet at my door” option when the driver isnt even willing to get out the car ?! frustrating.",2024-06-06 21:04:56,3,27,Reddit,UberEats

oddest uber eats experience just happened  like the title states i just had the oddest experience with uber eats. i placed an order to my local mcdonald’s and only received half my order. so i got a refund and reordered the missing items. i’ve have this happen and the past and ya it’s annoying but this time it’s was just odd and incredibly frustrating. got the notification the driver was picking up the food and then about 5 minutes later a call from what i thought was the driver. upon picking up the phone all i heard was the sound of the kitchen and beeping and a mcdonald’s employee just said “hey we don’t have your order” and i was very thrown off by that and asked what they meant. all of a sudden the employee just started talking to his boss about my missing order and then the call ended. i immediately called back and no one said a word to me for 2 minutes just employees talking the background about what was going on. i tried getting their attention thinking maybe i was on speaker and finally after 2 minutes a different employee says “so looks like someone stole your order and now there’s nothing for the driver to pick up.” i asked them “what do you mean? what am i supposed to do about that?” then the manger spoke and said “your drivers gonna call support and get your order replaced but there’s nothing we can do.” i’ve never had this happen before where the driver has given the phone to the employees or my food being stolen at the restaurant. as soon as the call ended i saw the order got cancelled which seemed odd since they said they were gonna call to get it replaced so i called support. let me tell you my least favorite thing to do is call uber eats support because 9 times outta 10 it’s a waste of time and they can’t actually do anything to help. surprise surprise it was a waste of time… all they said was that since the order was canceled i have to reorder it my self and they can’t do anything about it. i asked about the fact the driver who canceled had stolen my food and if there was anything they can do about that and they said no because there’s no proof. even though i had explained the situation entirely and told them everything the mcdonald’s employees were telling me and they still didn’t care. if i’m being completely honest i don’t even really care that i had to reorder it i’m mad that y’all got some of the worst customer service i’ve ever seen. i’ve worked in customer service my whole life and what could have made that call feel like y’all actually care about the customer is by addressing the problem even if there isn’t anything you can do about it you always apologize. a simple “i’m sorry to hear that happened we’ll make a note a look further into this” would have completely made that call a good customer service call. nope i got “theres no proof” to my concerns about a possible theft problem with a driver. y’all really need some better customer service training because even though the mcdonald’s call was the oddest thing i’ve experienced they had better customer service at the end of the day.,2024-06-06 17:03:53,1,0,Reddit,UberEats

tonight, i delivered to a hotel that needed a keycard to get in. the customer wanted it delivered to a meet at their room with a pin, but also would not answer. i again had no way to get inside the building. as this was likely my last delivery for the night, i stayed for about 5-7 minutes, texted a couple times, and called about 5 times; they did not answer. i left the order on the floor inside the front door, as there was absolutely no better place to put it (in an area in the city with homeless people sometimes late at night, no furniture inside the entryway, etc.). however, about 10-15 minutes after i got home (20-25 minutes after i dropped it off overall), he called me with an angry tone questioning why i just left it on the floor. i tried to be as polite as possible in telling him there was no other place to leave it, but he still seemed upset.

"uber eats accident insurance  let this post be a cautionary tale of luck, tenacity, and what not to do if you should ever be unfortunate enough to find yourself in this scenario.

i want to outline a couple of things just so you all know what your dealing with when you put your car and finances on the line doing ride-share (yes uber eats is considered ride-share).

1. make sure your personal auto insurance covers rideshare. if it doesn’t, switch immediately to a company that does. the deductible for uber eats is insane. i believe allstate, aaa , farmers and progressive offer rideshare depending on your state.

2. you’re deductible for uber eats if you get into an accident is $2500. unless you like to put a down payment on a car every time you get in an accident get your personal insurance in order. i’m sure uber does this because they cover millions of vehicles in the us so be warned. they also don’t offer rental assistance either so unless you have another vehicle or a family member who can drive you around you are at the mercy of the process (nothing moves slower than insurance; take my word for it).

3. ubers coverage only counts if you have a delivery in the vehicle. there’s some debate if you’ve accepted an order and are en-route but technically you are on the clock when you are “online”. the reason i stress this is so you know if you have physical food in the vehicle you fall under their coverage (-2500). if you are online with no delivery you fall under personal insurance. 

4. if you don’t have rideshare coverage don’t tell your insurance company you’re doing uber eats. most don’t like it and probably will refuse to cover you and will drop your claim.

5. uber only logs deliveries that you accept, confirm and complete. if you ever need to prove to your insurance you didn’t have a delivery with you, just go into your “see earnings activity” function under earnings. this can make or break your case with your insurance company. 

i got into an accident while online and accepted a delivery but cancelled right after the accident. i reported it to my insurance (gieco) who put me through the wringer and reviewed my eligibility for the claim because i said i was doing uber eats. thank god for learning about lesson #5 because it ultimately saved me $2000 in a deductible. i was also going through a sh*t storm in my personal life so the added stress of affording a 2500 deductible with no rental option was wearing me thin. i stayed on top of both insurance companies (progressive and gieco) and tried to get every little detail i needed out of the claim rep each time i called. some were helpful, some were rude, but i didn’t let that stop me. i figured out what i needed and by sheer luck my insurance agreed to cover the collision. i know this is not normal and i will switch my insurance after this claim resolves to cover rideshare. it was a nightmare to experience this. heed my warning and arm yourselves with knowledge.",2024-06-04 13:43:37,19,36,Reddit,UberEats

"flat rates? *(long explanation, question at bottom)*

hey guys, so i have been delivering with ubereats for about 5 years now. 

this year/summer has probably been the worst with earning $ through ubereats, which made me super excited when ubereats introduced flat rates in cleveland just this past month. but now i am not so sure? 

today i signed up for 5-8pm $15.50 active hour. i was online from 5 to about 7:30 and did not get a rq for two hours until a walmart order came in. i never do walmart orders because its always unpredictable and time consuming (would love to hear peoples thoughts on those orders, worth it?). 

i deny the rq and then am told i have one more to decline then my fix rate is over. i decline another walmart order it sent me and then immediately get taken off the fixed rate. 

i have talked to multiple support people about this and never can get a straight answer.

i first assumed that since i was online this whole time (2 hrs 30) i was still going to get paid at least $15.50 for the hours i spent waiting around, which feels fair but obvi not the case unfortunately. 

the question: 

how does the pay for fixed rate work? 

from what i gather, it is only during the time you spend going to and dropping off the order. 

but if the order is 30 mins long, and then you do not get an order for the next 30, you should still get half of the fixed rate price ? (done this but was told within the next hour since i forfeited two orders the rate was dropped). 

is this worth signing up for at all?

like i said, i’ve been with uber for years, just wondering if this is just more of their smoke and mirrors. 

any thoughts/advice welcome.

"educate me on the ""autofill/clipboard"" features plz. you know those deliveries where you just drop off the food and you are required to take a picture to finish the order? after submitting a picture you are given the option to send a 160 character message to the customer about where you left the food. sometimes whenever i'm about to send a message, i can't access my clipboard, only the autofill button when i wanna send my custom message (which does nothing btw, i have to manually type out the message i want to send.) i do not believe it is a phone hardware issue as the option for me to send messages is either random or there is a feature i don't know about that let's customers toggle custom messages sent by the food delivery person.

this is the message i usually send to customers when given the chance: (159 characters)

logically speaking, if the dressing is on the counter, that proves it was never put in your bag. essentially the restaurant dropped the ball not me! i am not an investigator nor do i open or inspect peoples food once it has been bagged. so i kindly explain to her, my job is to pick up and deliver. when i’m picking up an order, i’m expecting all contents of the order to be in your bag. she goes “well i paid extra for the dressing”…

"tips - question all the delivery companies say they give 100% of the tip to the person delivering the food. in all my orders i have no choice except to use a credit card. i know credit card companies charge merchants a certain percentage. let’s say it’s 2%. so if my tip is $10 then the delivery company is going to pay $0.20 so you get the full $10 tip?

i ask because i rarely tip … on the app. i don’t trust any of the delivery companies - all equally suspect. what i do is tip the driver in person. that way i know they get the full amount. 

last week i had a delivery of some bottled water and some snacks. i’m disabled so i asked the delivery person to bring it to my apartment door. the nice young man was very pleasant and look surprised when i asked him to wait so i could get the tip out of my pocket. when he saw the $5 he seemed pretty happy. when he realized there were four $5 bills he got very happy. 

for me it isn’t about the bill but what i get. so a nice young man who brings up some bottled water and some snacks to my door is doing me the service. i value that at $20 regardless of what the company pays. i also understand you are “independent contractors” so what you want to declare to the government is your business.

"dear drivers, please stop placing orders directly outside the customer's door. i honestly thought that it would just kind of be common sense  to not place an order directly in front of someone's front door. on the ground, nonetheless.

"no tip = no food my god. this morning, my acceptance rate has plummeted from 80% to 40% in less than an hour. 

to keep it short, no one is tipping today. 

90% of the delivery offers are for over 15 to 20 mi and less than $2-$3. gas is $4.50 - $5 a gallon in the chicago area. and you want me to use a gallon and a half of gas and only pay me $2? 

never gonna happen. 

i know many of us drivers come on here to complain about this. we post images, screenshots, examples. i could do the same but i'm not going to. because i would have to add about 30 different screenshots showing $2 for a 15-mile drive. that's just stupid.

regardless of the cost of your food. regardless of the fees that uber charges. you are hiring a driver to use their own car and their own fuel to deliver your food for you. if you do not compensate that driver for at least the cost of the fuel, not to mention the time it takes to go to the restaurant and drive all the way to your house, don't expect very many (if any)  drivers to accept that offer.",2024-06-01 07:46:34,26,213,Reddit,UberEats
"is it ok for drivers to sit at the restaurant for half an hour after picking up your order? i've ordered uber eats a few times recently and it's often taken nearly an hour for food to arrive (by which time it is completely cold and soggy) even though i'm ordering from restaurants less than 15min drive away. obviously food takes time to cook, that part has nothing to do with the driver. but then i see them arrive at the restaurant, they app says ""heading your way"", and the car just sits there on the map, at the restaurant, for half an hour, sometimes 40minutes. and then when they finally do get on the way, the drive time is estimated at double what it would realistically take, and they're dropping off another order on the way.

i don't understand - is this actually the norm/allowed? are they sitting at the restaurant waiting for another new order to be placed so that they can stack more before going to delivery locations? or has the restaurant made them swipe on the thing to say the order is ""collected"" when it's not actually ready yet, hiding their own wait times? 

when an order arrives an hour after ordering (during off-peak times, from a nearby restaurant) and it's cold and soggy and knocked about, i want to ask for my money back. but i don't want to cause drivers to not be paid/lose bonuses/lose commissions or however it works, i don't want someone to be harshly punished, i just think that uber should take some responsibility for the very poor service and idk.... maybe pay their drivers enough that they don't need to stack heaps of orders and inflate wait times?

"just a word of warning regarding offers from restaurants. beware when using offers that are from the restaurant!!!

we ordered from a restaurant we really like (we don't order much because we cannot afford it) because they had an offer for an item we really enjoy, and we also had a $5 coupon code through uber.

when the driver got to the restaurant, he found that they had missed part of the order, so he waited for them to make the missing 2 items. then, they ended up making the wrong items, so they threw the entire order out (because it was too old, which is so terribly wasteful) and started the entire order over. i added an extra tip for the driver for having to wait so long, and i was relieved when he was finally on the way, after he made another stop first. eventually, the order arrived... but almost half of it was missing (and the packets of sauce i didn't order were exploded all over the contents of the bag, too -- this was just not my night lol).

i went through the help process in the uber app to get the missing items refunded, but the total on my order actually increased. i contacted support, very confused, and they said because after the refund my order no longer met the minimum total of $35 for the offer from the restaurant, so the offer was removed. they also said they cannot do anything about it because the offer was from the restaurant and not uber, and i pushed because this didn't seem right... eventually, the rep said they'd give us $5 as a courtesy, and i was too exhausted at this point, so i took the offer -- however, they then came back and said that, because we'd used a $5 off coupon on the order (which was from a previous order that had problems and was automatically put on our account by uber), they couldn't give us any credit, and then immediately exited the chat -- so, no help there. i didn't bother with trying the restaurant because i know how they operate (i do delivery from there a lot) and they would only tell me to call uber.

i **ended up paying more than my original total, for less food**, (it ended up being the same price it would have been without the offer but only if we had actually received the missing items!) because part of my order -- through no fault of my own -- was not delivered. i calculated it all up, and i actually lost $14 (the cost of the missing items) by reporting the missing items.

"help: i will be deactivated in 7 days and uber is doing it on purpose; after speaking with several other bike couriers i believe uber is forcing bike couriers to get cars or leave the platform i have gotten a warning from the application saying i perform deliveries too quickly to be on a bike before. i immediately contacted uber support to let them know about the notice and they reassured me that it was simply a message and not a warning or cause for deactivation. today, several weeks after the first incident, i receive the same notification. however, this time i also receive a message about ""recent delivery delays"" for the same delivery. the delivery in question was an order 8 miles away and the in-app route estimate was 12 minutes, meanwhile the real estimate using a third-party application (google maps) was 29 minutes. the google maps application's car estimate was 13 minutes. i took screenshots of everything and spoke to two different uber support agents, amandeep and robert. they initially listened and then began returning automated responses. i know this because the second half of both conversations matched verbatim up u til their final good bye. i was basically ignored and told that my account will automatically switch to car delivery in 7 days. i will need to provide proof of insurance, a driver's license, and other pertinent vehicle registration info by then or i will not be able to go online: my account will be deactivated. how does uber expect me to buy a car in a week? i spoke to two other drivers who mentioned the same problem. one skirted the issue by simply delivering on dd as he had been multi-apping before.

"why are my payouts less than the advertised amount? hey guys i'm new to uber. unfortunately i got banned from doordash, and i'll be honest... i miss being a dasher. 

so i did my first two deliveries yesterday. the first one said $6 and the second said $10. i received the $6 for the first one but nothing for the 2nd after completing the delivery. messaged customer service, they confirmed they saw the $10 order but to wait 24 hours for it to show up in my earnings. 24 hours later i only got $6 for that 2nd order. 

why am i getting paid a different amount than what they are advertising when accepting an order? at doordash, the pay offered was guaranteed and i never had to worry about receiving compensation. 

now i'm reluctant to accept orders because 9/10 times they offer a high price, but i get half of that at payout. 

is this because people are removing their tips after i deliver their food? do they offer higher tips at first to get their order faster, only to remove the tip once we drop it off? are customers actively scamming drivers or am i just crazy? 

also, when i did doordash, i could make am easy $15 in an hour. i've been barely making $8 an hour with uber eats. wtf is up with that?

"slightly raging at starbucks manager for incompetence  i admit, i got a little bit agitated with their worker and manager.

starbucks service is always mediocre, i know.

i had a pickup. store was empty and no customer at the counter.

i enter the store. no greeting. i go to the counter to check for my order. nothing.
waited patiently. still no eye contact or greeting. zero communication.

then i got agitated for the lack of respect and asked if nobody greets and communicates with the customer.
they deflected they didn’t notice a 6‘2“ guy coming in.
then they said to pick up “ over there” where the sign was covered .
then the order was saying six out of seven out of eight and was covered by tape.

 just noticed it when i dropped it off, drove back to make sure that the order was complete and then the manager waited there for me and i said how am i supposed to know if the order is complete and she deflected” our regular drivers know and that’s how we do that.
“ maybe you should not pick up here then”

“ the customer orders here every day”

how the hell do you supposed to know all  these details, i just need the greetings and direction and the completion.

would’ve taken 30 seconds to get in and out the store. but nooo

again  i got more agitated. normally, i stay calm, but they pissed me off so much.

what would you do if they just mess up everything regarding reading, communication, and marking the packages?

thankfully, it was four minutes drive back.

almost 99% of all restaurants bandaged to mark to take pictures correctly and communicate.

didn't get any reports up until 2 days ago for the same thing. chronologically, that report should've come from an order i did that day or the day before. and because of the pasts reports, i always make sure whenever i got the pin code deliveries, i actually call and wait till the customer shows up or uber prompts me to take a pic and leave. 
but now i'm convinced some of them just want free food at this point, i once had a guy call me after i delivered his order(which was a meet at door order but customer instructions were to leave at door) saying that there was some items missing in his mcdonald's order and implying i stole them. i got a little annoyed and made it very clear that it's impossible for me to have done that, since there is a seal and you would know right away if it has been tampered. about a few minutes later, i get a notification from uber saying that i was not the person that did the delivery. that's actually annoying if it is indeed a refund tactic to have free food from uber, because we are the ones taking the hit.

"bait and switch pricing methods and fake inflating pricing schemes. redux. i was a bit confused with how uber labels and charges for the items listed in the app. i'm still a little on the unsure side about it but this is what i'm sure about.

1. uber inflates the prices in the app for certain items. i don't know if this is to quietly pocket the difference themselves or to have a buffer against whatever the promo offer you might have available. either way it seems unethical.
2. they list a stated ""discounted"" price as being a special perk from them directly but the price they show as discounted is the same price the store sells it on a regular basis to the general public. the price which they claim is the regular store price before their exclusive discount is bogus, completely made up by them because it never existed in the store for that price.

maybe someone can explain to me what the deal is. here's what happened:

i ordered a few items from safeway via ubereats, all of the items that had alcohol were priced ambiguously. for example, see first two images. both of the items show a large price in green next to a smaller crossed out price. i understood this to mean, one is the normal price and the other is a current sale price. however, the price shown in green is the actual store price. the price beside it is a completely random figure made up by uber for reasons unknown. i even spoke to safeway this morning to have the prices checked and they informed me that the store prices matched the green colored prices from the night before.

https://preview.redd.it/ngm9ea9qwv2d1.png?width=1096&format=png&auto=webp&s=cea51597d784f692a7a8e8fb2f4769211be7e463

https://preview.redd.it/orgw799qwv2d1.png?width=1096&format=png&auto=webp&s=b2f3e2f7d2f1a5dd05336fa686846ef5947199be

when speaking with uber about why they inflated the prices and charged for those fake prices instead of the real price, they made up several different excuses. they said because the receipt shows the price before any sales were totaled then subtracted later. this is untrue because other items on the receipt reflected the lower in-store prices in real time and even stated so on the receipt. however, the prices for any alcoholic item was charged at the crossed out price instead of their fake sale price (or real in-store price). they also tried to say that the discount i'd received reflected the pricing difference. that may be slightly true but actually wouldn't make sense because the receipt should say the price actually charged and reflect the in-store price if different. so if i had any promotional deal activated, that should be on-top of the total showing the actual prices and not made up inflated prices by uber. since they inflated three items to bogus prices, the ""promo"" discount in fact did nothing as it took from the already overinflated total.

[the receipt via app, showing other items that already reflected lower in-store prices charged. however, the items that had pre-inflated prices and were shown offering a discount price were now listed at those inflated, completely made-up by uber prices.](https://preview.redd.it/5sx66txywv2d1.png?width=1096&format=png&auto=webp&s=1834fe8fe3bd18852e2b383172fdd01dd3ed4912)

[shows a discount offer from the active promotion.. but in reality there is no discount because they've already charged inflated prices to offset any available discount. i'm not sure how it would show if you didn't have an active promotion, if they would then just charge you the inflated made-up price and just pocket it.](https://preview.redd.it/j6mwwtxywv2d1.png?width=1096&format=png&auto=webp&s=d9b88b4045564e9445e0af43cb80837027b5104e)

  
when i spoke with them this morning via the app, i had to go through four customer service reps to get an explanation before finally getting cut-off and notified that someone would respond within 6 to 12 hours. going on roughly ten hours now and nothing heard back yet. 

i'll post the chat with uber below. the chat shows the connections to all four chat representatives but the first three chats have not been included to save time, as they all just go over the same things and are mostly me just explaining the issue i was trying to figure out and that i've already explained in the main post. otherwise, text hasn't been changed or edited for spelling, grammar or context.

>!we are sorry for the inconvenience caused to you. can you elaborate on your concern? so i can better assist you.!<

>!in the app you advertise a certain price and then on the final receipt you change that price and charge on average $10 more per item. when you say that you give discounts at the end in a bundle that's just so you can obscure the fact that you're stealing so much money. because the other items that were actually discounted or changed in the store because they were lower show on the receipt and the other items that you inflate to steal money you don't change those you actually charge more than msrp so that you can steal money from that!<

>!so even if you give a discount the price is reflected on the receipt should show the prices that are in store and the price that you advertised in the app not the inflated price so that when you go to take your discount you're not actually giving a discount because you've already inflated the prices over what they regularly should be or you even advertised!<

>!i can see you have concerns regarding this order's total fare. i would like to confirm that you have already got the promotion of $24.70 which is the estimated offer for the discounted items that you were talking about.!<

>!right but you took out that promotion after you inflated all the prices so that you didn't actually give any discount or anything because you inflated fake prices so that that discount comes out to zero so you gave nothing and you lied it;s fraud, like bait and switch!<

>!did you use the promo code in this order?!<

>!how can you advertise a price and then charge way over that price and then say that the discount is whats coming off the price that you advertise how can that be an additional discount when it's over what you even advertised!<

>!no i didn't use a promo code, there was one active that was something like : up to 40% off your next three orders i just went by the prices that you had in your app that you lied about and then inflated and then pretended that to give a discount because you took a percentage off of already overly inflated prices that you had stolen so the discount equaled out to be nothing!<

>!as i already informed you about the estimated offer of $24.70 for the discounted items that you were talking about that is the advertise a price.!<

>!the problem has nothing to do with the discount the problem has to do with you lying about an advertised price and the price that it is in store pretending that it's on a discount when the price of your advertising is the actual price and then charging well over that price in the end and then taking a discount from that over inflated total charge!<

>!nope that's not true because the other items were discounted they were shown on the receipt is discounted but you kept these prices inflated so that you could steal additional money!<

>!you can see the final charges on the receipt sent to the email on your account!<

>!yes i've already done that!<

>!you've been caught already why don't you just honor the prices that you said it was and then refund the different!<

>!nick, which particular item you talking about?!<

>!i've got screenshots i'll send them to you!<

>!you clearly advertise the in-store price although it looks like it's at a discount because that is the inflated price that you discounted it to but then at the end you took out the full inflated price that's even over msrp!<

>!the actual charge may vary due to in-store prices, item availability, item substitutions, and special instructions.!<

>!if item prices are different in store, we’ll use the actual item prices to update your final subtotal and tax.!<

>!but you didn't you didn't change the prices to reflect what they really were in store you kept them at the over-inflated pre discounted price so that you can steal money!<

"driver stole food, unclear how to get help so frustrated, and ubereats limited customer service menu is not addressing the issue. driver sat at an intersection for like 20-30 min (we were tracking) and then marked order as delivered despite being 20 min away from us. not sure why uber even let them mark it as delivered given how far they are from the drop off location, seems pretty obvious it wasn’t delivered, but i digress.

anyway, the menu of support options in app is limited and nothing will connect us to a live person or give an option to dispute charge. do i have to raise this with my credit card company to get my money back? or is there a way to get ubereats to act?

also, how can i make sure i’m never paired with the driver again? i called 4 times and left messages giving the benefit of the doubt but they always either answered the call to hang up immediately or sent straight to voicemail.

i have done a few orders so far and wondered if any pros had some tips? 

some of the orders aren't worth it for a 45 min drive and $2 tip, but that impacts the acceptance rate. is the acceptance rate really that important? rather than wasting gas and stress on driving that far? last night, i drove 45 minutes and got $1 tip on one order, $0 on the other. what's your take on the acceptance and cancelation rate?

"my big writeup comparing doing uber eats to a traditional pizza delivery job well i did my first night on uber eats yesterday on friday.  i use to be a pizza delivery driver back around 2008 when gas shot up to $4/gallon.  i delivered pizzas for about 3 years, so i figured i’d go ahead and compare what uber eats was like compared to being a pizza delivery guy.

for some context on where i worked, it was at a regional pizza franchise.  double daves pizza.  this was in 2008, so this predates everyone having a smartphone.

***the tl:dr is;*** uber eats you work for free, working at a traditional pizza place you make some money.

**pay:**

at the pizza place i made $6.50/hr, the store paid $2/delivery, and customers on average tipped $3/delivery.  a typical busy friday night i’d work from 5pm until 10:30pm, and our ‘busy’ night might consist of 10 deliveries.  i’d end the shift with $85.75 total in 2008 dollars.  approximately $50 in cash consisting of tips and the shop delivery reimbursement, and another $35.75 coming in a weekly paycheck.  taking that $85.75 and converting it to 2023 dollars would be $124.8, or $22.69/hr.

it should be noted though that at other pizza places at the time, such as at dominoes, the hourly rate was $5.15/hr and the per delivery compensation was closer to $0.50/delivery.  customers don’t tip as well so the average tip would have been closer to the $2/delivery range.  but those stores would be much busier so you’d be delivering almost your entire shift.

with uber eats, the pay is solely whatever ue is paying plus whatever the customer tips.  with the tips i ended up doing $38.03 over 2.5 hours, or $15.21/hr.

**pizza place wins on pay ($22.69/hr vs $15.21/hr)**

**driving distance:**

at the pizza place, we had a 3 mile delivery radius from our store.  basically worst case scenario would be taking a single delivery to a house on the edge of our delivery zone, costing about 6 miles round trip.  over that 5.5 hour shift taking 10 deliveries that could total up to 60 miles driven, or 10.9 miles driven per hour.

uber eats seems to have deliveries going all over the place.  of the 2.5 hours, the last 30 minutes of that was driving back home.  i started out about 3 miles west of my home and ended 25 miles east.  counting the 25 miles of deadheading back home, i ended up driving a total of 71 miles.  so over the 2.5 hours that comes out to 28.4 miles driven per hour.

**pizza place wins on miles (10.9 miles/hr vs 28.4 miles/hr)**

**net pay:**

we all know it’s not solely how many dollars per hour you make when it comes to these jobs that use your personal car.  you have to pay for your own gas, your own maintenance, your own repairs, and eventually to replace your own car.

i believe for a car the main factor in depreciation is age much more so than miles.  a 5 year old car with 60,000 miles on it will sell for more than a 5 year old car with 120,000 miles on it, but you’re only going to get maybe $1k or $2k more.  that 120k mile 5 year old car will still get more money than an 8 year old car with 100k miles.

at the pizza place in 2008, we had $4/gallon gas and i was getting about 25mpg.  so my gas cost was $0.16/mile.  when i did the math on maintenance i came up to about $0.10/mile.  just ball parking, a new car at the time was around $25,000 and if you get 120,000 miles out of it over 10 years that’s about $0.21/mile.  so at least with my peabrain math, $0.16+0.10+0.21=$0.47/mile, or $0.70/mile in 2023 dollars.  so driving 10.9 miles per hour cost  $7.63 2023 dollars, the $22.69-$7.63=$15.06/hr net in 2023 dollars.

doing uber eats in 2024, the comparison is a bit different.  current gas prices where i’m at is $3.06/gallon.  my car gets 42mpg.  it’s actually a plug-in hybrid so the first 40 miles or so are electric, then the 42mpg happens after, but i’ll just ignore that to keep this comparison simple.  so the gas cost, $0.07/mile.  maintenance, idk but i’ll ballpark it at $0.15/mile.  that’s what lines up with inflation so it’s probably about right.  the car itself was $37,000 and with the same 120,000 miles now we’re at $0.31/mile.  so again with the peabrain math $0.07+0.15+0.31=$0.53/mile.  so driving 28.4 miles per hour costs $15.05.  the $15.21-$15.05=$0.16/hr.

so yeah, 16 cents per hour.  this isn’t taking the irs mileage rate and saying i don’t have to pay any taxes, this is taking actual income and removing actual expected expenses.  even if we ignore the cost of the car solely look at fuel and maintenance costs… that’s still just $8.96/hr net.

**pizza place wins on net pay ($15.06/hr vs $0.16/hr)**

**responsibilities:**

at the pizza place, when you weren’t out delivering you were at the store.  you had to answer the phone when it rang to take orders.  you had to run the oven, taking the pizzas out, slicing them, boxing them.  you had to do prep-work, slicing the onions, peppers, mushrooms, etc.  you had to wash the dishes, the dirty pans, dirty silverware, and dirty plates and cups from the dining room.

when it was your turn to take an order, you’d have to look at the map and figure out how to get there.  you’d have to write down the directions somewhere.  then you’d have to bag up the order yourself.

if the order was to someone that never tips, too bad, you’re taking it anyway.  if it’s to a place that’s difficult to deliver to, like a large 10,000+ employee business campus, too bad, you’re taking it anyway.

when doing the deliveries you’d have to mentally figure out how much change to give back to the customer and count that out.  not everyone can go “hmm, they gave me $40 and their total was $27.03 and i only have paper bills… that’s $12 i need to give back to them.  five, ten, eleven, twelve, here ya go!”

while you were out delivering if you were taking too long the owner or manager would call you and tell you to pick up the pace.  on top of this, this was a job where you had scheduled shifts.  so if you’re supposed to be there at 5pm on friday, then you needed to be there at 5pm otherwise you’d get in some trouble for being late.

at the end of the night you’d have to help close the store.  so there’s sweeping and mopping that has to happen.

additionally since this was a job, you had a uniform.  had to wear the company t-shirt.  had to wear the company hat.  ending every day with hat-hair sucked.  then for your car you had to put that magnetic sign on the top of it, advertising to everyone you’re delivering.

with uber eats, wow i get that whole “be your own boss” thing.  go online on the app when you want to work, go offline when you don’t.  see a delivery you don’t want to take?  then don’t take it.  just show up at the store, get the food, drop it off at the customer site, done.  i had one delivery yesterday that wasn’t ready when i showed up, the guy working there basically turned around and said “i don’t see it sitting on the shelf, so it’s not ready.  and i’m not going to check on it since they’re back there cooking.”  took me 10 minutes to figure out how to cancel, but i canceled it and moved on to the next one.

when it was all said and done, with the pizza job i had to take a shower each night when i got home.  the uber eats you really don’t.

**uber eats wins on responsibilities (just deliver vs all the other restaurant stuff)**

**safety factor:**

both jobs are inherently dangerous since you are out on the road driving.  i’d argue the pizza place was more dangerous since you would drive around with that giant light on top of your car while wearing a uniform, since it was known you’d be walking around with large amounts of cash, anyone who saw you could see an opportunity to rob you.  most customers paid in cash and we didn’t cash out until the end of the night.  with our average orders being $25 and taking 10 orders, i was easily walking around with $250 by the end of the shift.

add in all the prep work, the dishwashing, running the ovens, and the end of night cleanup.  there’s risks of cutting yourself, burning yourself, or slipping and falling on the mopped floors.  i usually had a cut or a burn on an almost weekly basis.

uber eats, you don’t carry any cash.  you don’t have anything that advertises you’re delivering.  that doesn’t mean you won’t get robbed, but their isn’t nearly as much to be robbed of so i’d think the risk is lower.

**uber eats wins on safety factor (no giant advertisement that you’re walking around with lots of money in an unfamiliar place)**

**ease of delivery:**

at the pizza place, most orders were paid in cash.  maybe that’s changed some today since everyone just orders on-line, but every delivery you’d have to knock on the door and ring the doorbell, wait for it to be answered, get the money or get the credit card slip signed, hand over the pizza.  half the times the doorbell didn’t work so you’re having to pound on the door hoping someone hears it.

uber eats seemed like almost every delivery was a “leave at door” order.  very simple, just set the food there, take a picture, and press that “order delivered” button.  for the orders where they do want to meet you at the door, the customer already gets a bunch of notifications when you arrive so they’re already up and ready to get the food.

technology wise, not having to write down directions is great.  but these apps that put a dot directly on the house you’re going to is great too.  i remember having to find one house that was like 1177 oak street, then having to count up or down to find the house i was delivering to just because half the homes you can’t read the numbers.  “ok that’s 1200, i’m going to 1177 so it’ll be on the other side of the street.  ok there’s 1201… cant read the number on the next house… can’t read it on the next one either… ok 1207, dang, i need to turn around… ok there’s 1201 again, there’s a cross-street so now we should be in the 1100’s but i can’t read this house… can’t read this one either… ok 1183, this next one must be 1181, ok then 1179, ok this one is the house”.

**uber eats wins on ease of delivery (just pick up and drop off)**

so in summation, uber eats is easier and safer, but you basically are working for free.  y’all are more than welcome to try and figure out a better “net pay” for uber eats but it just doesn’t math out right to me.  but even as i said if your car was free… still the “net dollars per hour” you’re making is significantly less than in 2008.  this of course is true across all professional fields, not just food delivery.  our standard of living continues to degrade in the usa :(",2024-05-25 12:31:09,9,17,Reddit,UberEats

"observation after ordering in nyc area for the second time so i ordered from this place nearby with an estimated delivery time of 10-15 minutes. after the driver picked up the food he stood still at the same location for almost 20 minutes before he started biking towards my house (a 4 minute bike ride). 

that’s when i realized this also happened a few days earlier when i placed my first order here in nyc. both drivers “froze” on the map for several minutes and timed their deliveries to be completed just before the ‘latest arrival time’ shown in the app. 

i’m almost certain this is happening because of the drivers’ new pay by the hour structure that was implemented in nyc a few months back. i don’t know how to feel about this. i’ve always tipped drivers a minimum of $5 regardless of how close the restaurant is, many times much more than that. i even tipped the first driver despite him being purposely late. but now i’m not so sure i want to even order delivery anymore. if drivers keep doing this then it will be faster (and much cheaper)  if i just pick up the food myself from now on",2024-05-23 23:58:41,0,4,Reddit,UberEats

"priority orders not getting priority delivery i have had this happen several times in the last year. i want to figure out what i can do to understand, and prevent it.

there are a few places i order from that a speedy delivery is vital. others, it's less important. when it is important i pay the $3 (and now $4) for priority delivery. when i get an alert that the driver has the order, i look at the map and see them drive in a completely opposite direction or make a stop along the way that is in a neighborhood or two stops, one at a restaurant and another in a neighborhood.

are they buying multiple apps? are they ignoring priority delivery? are they not aware of the priority order info? 

i have tried to report these events, but it seems uber doesn't want to know. the last event of this kind made my food an hour late. i was unable to describe the issue to uber, because the reporting process was all radio buttons... no place to type  words. i did get a refund, but what i'd really like is for it to not happen again. 

most often when this happens i'll adjust the tip downward and carry on with my cold or no longer fresh food.

what's the trick? what do i need to know? how to prevent?

"bogo deals becoming a red flag 
i've noticed 3 things commonly occurring when ordering bogo items on uber eats and have thus started avoiding them when not attached to a known franchise. i am considering making a comprehensive list of offending businesses through reporting from myself and others.

1. many restaurants will double the price of an item for a bogo special, meaning you are not actually getting two for half price, you are paying for 2 and paying tax for 4

2. reduced portions for bogo orders are becoming common. occasionally an item will be shown as a full serving, but be a small side. or they will take the meat portion of a menu item and divide between two meals and then add filler like rice and such.

3. deceptively poor quality. we are talking spaghetti noodles, ground beef and soy sauce being sold as korean bbq beef noodles. a ketchup container with a small portion of canned chili sold as a 10$ side soup.

"trying to offer good customer support as a driver, to our customers is being increasingly punished  i spent 25 minutes on a panda express order because someone stole the order, and they refused to remake it unless uber gave permission to (some restaurants remake it no problem, but not this place!) so i called the customer, they said they didn't get their food delivered, and to please get uber and the restaurant to remake it, the guy said it was for his wife and asked really nicely, i also let him talk with the panda express worker over speaker phone and she told him the same thing about needing uber's permission. 

so i finally call uber, they just canceled the order and paid me $3, i asked if they would contact the customer and help him with his order, uber support tells me ""we need to have the customer resend an order to remake it"". 

so they screwed over the customer and paid me $3. lesson learned, any restaurant that hands out food to thieves without at least remaking the order is screwing their customers, delivery drivers, and uber eats support is helping them make this platform terrible for everyone involved. sorry panda express guy, your wife isn't getting her work lunch apparently ",2024-05-23 14:37:50,11,46,Reddit,UberEats

i then sent an email to the ubereats support, explaining the whole situation and stating that i was filing for a refund with paypal, since support was no help at all. i got an automatic response saying i’d hear back in 24 hours.

update that no one asked for but i hope it provides more context i contacted ubereats support about it soon after making this post and they responded to me at around 4 pm saying that because my order was made more than 48 hours ago they cannot resolve it monetarily. it hasn't been more than 48 hours though...... it's been less than 24 hours.

no problem, theres enough of the $6-$12 orders to make it worth it.

but then. you get the restaurant a couple miles away and.... ""its already picked up, you're the 5th driver to come in for that order"".

or, you can get to the restaurant and the order is there and ready for pickup :claps hands: you drop off the order without issue and you smile slowly weath teary eyes.

only to wait an hour for the tip to confirm and see the message ""customer has reduced their tip"" so now an order that you drove and picked up then delivered because of its $9 payout, is now $3.13 

too many mind games. too much wasted time. thats was when it was possible to contact a supervisor and get the full payout that you actually accepted this job for. now, they wont even send you to a supervisor ""we can only schedule a call back"" only for one to never come.

$3 compensation is bullshit really tired of accepting orders with huge payouts only to drive over to the store and learn that i’m the 5th driver that’s stopped by and that the order was either picked up or not in their system. 9 times out of 10 the store doesn’t want to fulfill the order as well. not to mention when you’re forced to cancel the order you don’t get a boost nor is it applied to any active quests. it has to be the worst tactic this app has to get drivers to resolve issues with orders.,2024-05-19 15:31:56,67,106,Reddit,UberEats

"health and safety... omg today, i experienced two very disturbing events... i have currently turned off shop & pay because i refuse to do any more of those gd cases of water up flights of stairs... nope. that's over and done.

what i have to say may not be something everyone wants to hear, but... well... it's something i can't get out of my head.

----

simply put: i stopped at an outdoor pickup restaurant that is simply a kitchen with a walk-up window. kind of like the old ice cream shops. this one is a roast beef and polish sausage place...

after backing into the parking space, i grabbed my thermal bag and was about to get out of the car when a woman walked directly in front of my car, stopped, (nsfw)>!pulled her bottoms down, and picked her buttocks. not skin. literally inside.!< (end nsfw)

then she walked up to the window in front of me, her cell phone in hand, and wiped the dirty hand through her hair. she proceeded to order an instant meal then - after i had returned to my car with the pick up order - she was eating the food using that same completely unwashed hand.

i apologize if this disgusts anyone. i feel queasy just remembering it... i tried to keep it as pg as possible in descriptions.

idk how this woman is still alive. i did mention to the cook at the window to wash his hands and sanitize the cash she gave him. i whispered loud enough for him to hear what she had done with the same fingers his own fingers had touched when taking her cash.

----

the second incident was at a delivery location. i was dropping off the food for a customer, ""leave at door"" style. as i was about to take the picture, the man opened his front door and stepped outside to grab his food. he smiled and waved, asking if i wanted him to pose for the camera. i quickly put my phone away and ran to my car.

this was a man in his mid 50s, (nsfw)  >!hairy as an ape, quite... robust in size... and he was completely nude. it was all hanging out there. worse... he was... dripping... and not sweat. and some of it dripped on the bag of food. and when he turned around to re-enter his home... he was... unwashed... unwiped...!< (end nsfw)

----

i get it some people have no taboos, but... that was... very triggering and made my mind up to take the next week off. omg.

smh.

i apologize if these events disturb you. i imagine some of you are laughing your asses off... i have already showered once since i got home... i'll probably shower before bed and again in the morning just to feel clean.",2024-05-18 20:04:00,4,7,Reddit,UberEats

the app said it required a pin. i think customers can request it? and its the last 4 digits of your phone??

i'm at front entrance and she says she doesn't see me. (texting btw). i said i was at the entrance.... they said they were on the third floor lol...

so i get in the elevator and go up. they say leave it at the desk... i said i need a pin i'm coming up, there is no room number..

elevator opens and the girl is right there, an employee. i hand food and they give me the wrong pin twice.

then they opened the bag, and checked to make sure everything was there, that took 15 seconds, then i get the correct pin.

we both go down and btw, there was someone she was escorting and she had to wait until were done, then her co workers came up and said ""yo.. when you get food?? when you get good?"" really loud ( it was lunch time in the lobby, the cafeteria was there, and they were the only people making noise.

she said ""cans you help me please???"" trying to push her cart over the elevator gap. the guys kept giving her attitude so i picked up the end of her cart and help her over and told her have a nice day.

my tip was removed. she wanted me to leave the food in the lobby without the pin. she gave me the wrong pin twice. she checked 100% of the order before giving me the pin....

she works in a nursing home. this person is stealing left and right. i can't help but feel she wouldn't hesitate to steal from the patients.

"adjustment scam? i ordered uber eats for lunch when they had an add-on option. i realized i was out of pet food (turns out it was in a different cabinet, face palm) so i ordered it because i wouldn’t get off work before the store closed. 

market cost for item:
price at target/walmart in store: $5-6
price at cvs/walgreens: $6-7
price for cvs in uber: $8.79 with a dollar discount so $7.79.  

it gets delivered and i get an adjustment notification. they’ve added $3.49 to my order. the justification my one item cost more money. i checked the drugstore app, it’s currently priced at $6.49. uber is trying to charge me $11.28 for something almost half the price in store. there’s no way the drugstore jacked up their prices in store that much that it would cost the uber total to get that high and the drugstore app wouldn’t be multiple dollars off. 

 this feels like a made up charge. i messaged support and got it refunded, but has anyone seen anything similar? to be clear, it was not a different size or brand. my pet refuses to eat anything but one type of food, i know the market price on this one bag of food very well over the last few years.

you cant get a free side of fries now if you want a discount too.
if theres an item thats discounted 10%, better hope its not something you wanted, because you cant use a 40% off if you have that item in your cart now.

prices are already inflated sometimes up to 50%, then add onto that the fees, then the driver tip. using 1 deal makes laziness justifiable. using 2 deals made you maybe pay normal price. and using multiple deals and picking it up yourself could actually save u a buck or 2 and make the app feel worth keeping.

quite frankly this is now just a rich lazy person app. i mean things were already getting bad and hard to justify with prices rising like 25% for me the past year but this is the nail in the coffin.

ue coming in with the real hot promotions! ,2024-05-16 01:31:55,1,1,Reddit,UberEats
"customers need to realize ue keeps most of the delivery & service fee for example if you don't tip. it will show approx $5 for 15mi trip for the driver...(30m round trip) it's laughable. sad really. without at least a $5 tip. no one should be accepting these orders (it doesn't even cover gas let alone wear and tear on your vehicle). this would force uber to increase its base pay & not force customers to tip so much.
the tip is what we rely on sadly for the income. customers need to think of it as a bidding, for a service that otherwise would be unavailable...you have all these other customers out there and the ones who tip the best get their food the fastest by the best drivers most of the time.
if you don't tip most drivers will decline. if you tip bait me, you will be reported, your account does get flagged and uber reimburses us most of the time if you know how to talk to them...
ubers ceo did uber eats as an undercover boss and was tip baited. leave at least a $5 dollar tip... if you want your food faster, make it $10. if you get a crappy driver, you can always reduce it within an hour. just don't get your account flagged for tip baiting. if there was no issue and you had an excellent delivery.

"uber is run by bots i had a cvs shopping order today is an insanely busy part of town where that was absolutely zero parking except for a parking garage. thankfully, it has a 15 grace period (presumably for delivery drivers etc that don't need to park for hours). unfortunately for me, my particular customer was not very responsive when it came to choosing replacements for items they wanted that weren't in stock which caused me to be in the store for over that 15 minute grace period. 

they didn't respond so i cancelled the item in question and hurriedly rushed back to my car only to be slapped with a whopping 18 dollar parking fee (the ride paid about 7 dollars). after i dropped off the customers order, i hit up uber support for a reimbursement and they literally juggled me back and forth 7 times between 2 departments. they all used the same pre selected messages and keywords too before one of them eventually told me they weren't going to pay me back. 

it's so immeasurably disappointing to be forced to spend my own money on this type of stuff with absolutely no recourse. i'm new to uber eats but i'm quickly learning that the best way to earn money efficiently is to just be an dick about everything. it sucks too cuz part of me wants to enjoy bringing people food (mostly cuz i love when i get my food after a long day or whatever) but if i jump through any hoops of my own accord or inconvenience myself at all, it just turns around a bites me.

come the next day where i give this driver the same instructions, he still wasn't there. went to the parking lot, found him, and he said that uber sent him there instead of where i placed the pin. so i felt bad for the first guy since it was a misunderstanding on the location, and i kinda don't want to cause someone who is probably an immigrant lose their job and/or be blamed for something that was the restraunts fault. so how can i re-rate him?",2024-05-14 17:48:55,1,1,Reddit,UberEats

"10 dollar price adjustment on a grocery order i ordered groceries from uber eats and after they were delivered i got an email receipt and the total was 10 dollars higher than the original total due to “adjustments”. i was taking the mcat that weekend so i had to focus on studying but i reached out to support yesterday to clarify the total. they tried to tell me it was due to price differences in the store so i sent screenshots of the prices of all the items i purchased showing they are actually cheaper in store. they then replied saying it’s been more than 48 hours so there’s nothing they can do. is there anything i could do? should i try going through my bank? i’ve been an uber one member for literal years and this is the first time they’ve been difficult. 

edit: i called uber eats customer support like somebody had suggested and they did verify the 10 dollar adjustment was incorrect. however, because i reached out to them after more than 48 hours had passed since the order was delivered there’s nothing they can do. i don’t want to do a chargeback through my bank because it sounds like it’ll get me banned. sufficient to say i’m annoyed but defeated. 

to clarify, i just got a few of those sargento snack packs to take with me to my exam and panko since i was busy cramming and my husband would’ve gotten out of work too late, so weight differences don’t come into play in this situation. i compared the prices in the app with the prices in the store and of course the app prices were more expensive (which i knew is the case when i placed the order), hence why the adjustment on top of the already higher prices made no sense.

"rough night i really needed some money soon, so i have been trying to deliveried via uber eats. i guess i was tired if i made a mistake, but i ended up taking a request at a restaurant. while i was at said restaurant, i got another request for an order at that store. i accepted it, but my app stalled in that it was ""checking to see if i was the best match"" for a hot minute. i think my app refreshed itself, but it appeared as if i had to re-verify the first order again. in other words, it looked like i didn't get the second request. to verify the orders at the restaurant, i had to scan a qr code on the order receipt. the app accepted the qr code both times, which supported my thought that i had to verify the same order (why use qr codes that aren't unique for a period of time?). one of the restaurant clerks saw this too. 

i left the store and finished the first delivery, but then the second delivery showed up. since i didn't have the food, i messaged the customer saying that i would have to return to the store for his order, and that i would contact support too. the customer was okay with this. however, the support agent i spoke to accused me of canceling without intending to make the delivery despite my explicitly telling them that i just needed to go back to the store. by telling support anything, i was hoping that they would understand that this trip would tske more time. the agent ultimately insisted that i not worry, and cancelled this second trip. several minutes from when i started this post i saw an warning email from the app about fraud.

how do you or how did you transition out of delivery apps? or did you add new apps? i used to easily make $800+ a week doing delivery apps(some weeks over $1000 during stimulus heaven) now i’m working same amount of time and making $600. idk if i should pick up the hours and try to become a shopper to on spark. i’m guessing i could still make $800 plus in 60 hours but i’m starting to panic. does anyone know of any escape routes for unskilled delivery app drivers?,2024-05-11 23:51:31,3,3,Reddit,UberEats

"driver taking forever? what could be the reason?  i ordered food for a late night snack. took awhile for someone to be assigned but it’s late so i didn’t think much of it. finally someone accepted and i watched the map. they sat on a residential street for almost 45 minutes. did not move. i reached out to support and about 5 minutes after that the driver drove to the restaurant. now they have been sitting at the restaurant for 30 minutes…. i am getting extremely irritated at this point. it’s been nearly 2 hours since i ordered and it’s now an hour past the “expected delivery time”. she has a horrible rating too…and now i see why. ughhh…. what in the world could be causing this delay??

"driver shopped wrong items, what do i do?   i had a pet food order, i have to be really careful with my cat because he has health issues so the flavors have to be really specific. they were out of a box of multi flavor cat food, so instead of switching it for another box of flavors, i texted hey can we just get the individual cans of the flavors from that box instead. and i called him just to make sure he understood. he said no problem. 

he said okay he got it i just had to accept the alternative item (which was another box, but i figured we talked about it, so he wouldn’t be getting the box) 

when i looked at the bags, he didn’t do what i talked to him about and just brought a box of other flavors my cat can’t eat some of. i also ordered individual cans of three flavors and he got the wrong type for all of them. 

i worked for lyft for a little bit and i know how fucked up these companies are so i don’t want t to screw over the driver… it was an honest mistake. but at the same time i am so short on cash i can’t afford another order and to just let it go. but i’m worried if i complain to uber and they refund it will he not get paid? or is there a better solution here?

you either weren't responsible enough to come collect your food on time before *someone else* came and intercepted it and took it or, you're just straight up lying to try and get a refund.

please don't do this. have some integrity. be a good human being. tell your friends/family not to do this either. what if i go to your job and make up some fabricated story about you where you get written up or possibly fired? and there is no hr who can protect you. no one would like that. please don't do this.",2024-05-11 18:27:40,59,61,Reddit,UberEats

"big dogs... disclaimer: i understand millions of people around the world have deep affection for dogs of all types. i have a strong phobia of all dogs, especially those that could tackle me to the ground. this is not at all a harp against anyone who loves a dog it is simply my opinion and my out look.

i feel that customers who have dogs outside their home, who have been trained to protect the family within that home, should consider the safety of delivery drivers when they choose to leave their dog outside and place orders. 

today was an average ue delivery day for me. in fact, a dead slow saturday in comparison to previous saturdays. but just as it was about to pick up around 11:30 a.m., i took a delivery to a home. the home had a gated entryway. a tall white wooden gate that hid behind it an unexpected surprise.

the delivery instructions were to enter the gate and place the food by the door on the stairs. i tried to do that. but then a giant dog appeared and ran straight for me. 

my fight or fight reflex kicked in and i immediately froze. the dog roughly brushed against me, sniffing my legs and crotch. it sniffed the thermal bag that contains the customer's food and the bottom of the cup of coca-cola that i was holding. 

i could not move. i was petrified. this dog was not making any direct threat to me, but i remembered the incident that caused my phobia of dogs and was triggered. 

it was only when the dog started growling and moaning that my flight instincts kicked in and i carefully placed the food and drink on the concrete steps and slowly escaped. 

i would advise anyone who has a dog even in a fenced-in outdoor area to keep it from approaching delivery people. certainly, the majority of delivery people would be happy to see the dog and greet them. but if your dog is not trained properly to respect people who are calmly and slowly delivering something, please keep that dog inside. 

___

context: 

when i was 16 years old, i had a job. my first real job at mcdonald's. i was learning how to prepare and serve all of the freeze dried ingredients. the supervising manager of that mcdonald's was an alpha male man's man. he was a chain smoking, beer chugging, gun wielding, monster truck driving son of a b**** who treated everyone like s*** and looked at any woman with anything more than a b cup as if she was his personal play thing. that's just context for who this person is. 

on one of my days off, several months into my employment, i was heading to the library on my 18 speed bicycle. i noticed the manager walking down the street in plain clothes. he was also walking a massive rottweiler. having been intimidated and treated like s*** by him at work, i chose to ignore him and keep riding...

and then i heard...  ""sick em!!""

in less than 30 seconds, that giant rottweiler had my left leg in its teeth clamped down to the bone. in shock and pain, i was ripped from my bicycle and thrown across the street by this giant beast. i was nearly run over by a car as this growling menace attacked me. 

i somehow managed to get to my feet and run to my bike, avoiding the dog, and bleeding down my pant leg, i fled at the fastest possible speed i could pedal. 

in the end, my mother pressed charges and had the rottweiler put down and i was fired from mcdonald's because i had been attacked and the dog was being walked without a leash and had been trained to kill. 

so every time i see a dog, my initial instinct is that fight or flight and the memory of what happened. i completely understand not all dogs are like that. i completely understand that most dogs are gentle, loving creatures. but it still stands in my mind, when i see a dog, run!",2024-05-11 16:42:04,2,2,Reddit,UberEats
"ubereats doesn’t care about paying customers! it’s important for us to understand that as consumers we have the rights to call out when big corporations try to take advantage of us or lack the ability to take responsibility!

i had such an experience while using ubereats service last week. 

for context, i was away with family to the peak district where we used the app to order some food. the order was accepted immediately as expected but then we received a notification that our order has been cancelled!

we received an email claiming that we had requested the order to be cancelled! this was absolutely not true!

we called the restaurant and they told us that they have cancelled the order by mistake and that uber customer care would help us get a refund, apparently!

at this point i tried to contact uber customer care only to be redirected from one page to another page without being able to connect with a human! in frustration i reached out to @uber_support on 𝕏, only to be told to go back on the app and they provided me a link which once again took me around in circles! i don’t know how but finally i managed to see a prompt where i could type out my concerns.

after explaining everything with a some hope, i received a very prompt canned response from uber that nothing could be done about it!

to that, my frustration full response was to point out that they didn’t do any investigation about the concern raised at all. 

and to my astonishment the response from uber was that they’ll not do anything about it!

this is beyond ridiculous! i can’t believe this is actually happening to paying customers. 

many of my friends also mentioned that they have never received refunds from ubereats ever when there was an issue! 

i’m now £40 out of pocket without them ever even acknowledging that there was a problem.

my workplace has a free cafeteria with pretty good food for breakfast and lunch on the weekdays. so basically daily dinner and most meals on the weekends are via this platform.

"uber eats is greedy! last week, i ordered from uber eats at least 5 times. out of those 5, 3 orders were either messed up or missing some or quite a bit of my order. 

i always immediately try to contact the driver to inquire if any of my order was left in the car but, once they have delivered i never can reach the driver again. 

so, one order was missing a $50 steak meal from red lobster. i called the restaurant directly and spoke to a unicorn. the manager was very apologetic and understanding but, his hands were tied since it was ordered thru uber eats. extremely, bothered that i had to make the oh so familiar call to y eats, i prepared myself mentally because it’s always some bs. 

as i suspected, they wanted to interrogate me about a $300+ order. i went along with answering the questions but, then the stupid question was asked…”did you take a picture of the missing food”? 🤯🧐
silence came over the phone. i advised i had not as it is not possible, because it is missing! 

they finally refunded the missing items $60+. so, i called the restaurant back and he was more than willing to make the order but, he needed to call uber to see if they would send a driver to deliver the missing items. uber, understandably refused because it wasn’t their mistake. 
after wasting almost an hour back and forth, it was too late to reorder because everyone else was done eating and my son just made a sandwich. 

next day, i ordered food from a place called dirty burger. i had never ordered from here but, since they had a great offer of anogo combo meal (which included a drink) i placed the order for 4 meals (which was 8 combo meals total). 

there were 3 full brown paper bags filled with only burger and fries. i immediately called the driver and no answer. the automated system they have has a middleman and each time i called there was a missed call because you don’t call the driver directly (in most cases unless the driver contacted you first for some reason). 

i finally called uber eats and the rep said that they “… needed to review my order”. i asked “how can you review the missing items”.  long story short, apparently if you have ever requested a refund because of a restaurant’s mistake, they look at your account to see how many times you have done so. i asked to speak to a supervisor and was told one would contact me. no call or correspondence. i called again and was told i would get an email. huh? all of my drinks are missing!

fast forward, o received a ridiculous and intelligence insulting canned response.

to paraphrase, they said since i didn’t have the receipt and a picture of the missing items i am not entitled to a refund and they didn’t see a replacement order made. 
why would i place another order which would require me to tip again and i am too generous with tipping to be held hostage by the restaurant.
i couldn’t order the drinks because it was a part of a combo and it wasn’t my fault . i didn’t make the order or forget to send all of the meal i paid for. so, i was refused a refund. 

they have done this several times where i just say forget it because it’s not a battle worth fighting but, they continue to rob me without a gun!

it enough to be fighting for my life but to have to also fight for the food i paid good money for is egregious and only the customer loses out! uber eats only want to take , take, take!

is it worth filing a complaint with the appropriate agencies (i.e. bbb which can’t really do anything, attorney general)? i’m sick of them screwing me out of money at no fault of my own😢

i thought i found my unicorn, a simple jack in the box order which i found odd for 32 miles away but since i needed the money, i went ahead either way              

i picked up and headed for the drop off, 
as i got closer to the address i realized, it was in the middle of nowhere,  no lights nor houses nor actual road, pure dirt and gravel 
i stopped 200ft from the house at a right turn , because it became a one way gravel road that led directly to the address and i was getting a weird feeling
 i called the customer and a google assistant kept picking up, and i know google assistants can be used to fake a phone number, so i texted the customer if they could come pick up, but no reply 

i decided to head down in my car, and turned off my lights just to not alert anybody, eventually i had to turn them back on because i couldn't see. and the moment i did so.
a pair of headlights came on from the address of the drop-off and started speeding down to me i made a quick u turn and gunned it out of there the vehicle that came out was able to get beside me on my car, and tried to overtake so i could not get out of the one lane road but i sped up and got out of there, before he could. 
called uber and cancelled the order, i am still shaking typing this.

"odd comment from delivery driver so i had an ubereats delivery and my preferences were meet at door and i saw the driver pulling up and by the time i got downstairs to open the door she was sitting it down on the porch. i thanked her and she asked ""you don't have dogs or anything do you?"" i said no she smiled and said ""ok good"" and left. 
i have cameras outside but i've yet to have a delivery driver ask me that. i didn't think about it in the moment but that's a weird question.  has anyone else had this happen?

and it couldn't have been a tipping issue, tip was 13 and the trip distance less than 1 mile. would have picked it up myself but my car won't be ready from repairs until tomorrow.",2024-05-09 19:12:47,2,14,Reddit,UberEats
"uber -25 minute wait, cold mcdonalds  we just spent $30 on 2 large fries, a large soda and a big mac delivered by ubereats. mcdonalds is literally 6 minutes from my house.  it arrived about 25 minutes later.  in the interim it sat on mcdonalds unheated pickup shelf.  5 minutes, 10….   

so everything’s cold. must be microwaved.  coulda done that from my freezer for a couple of bucks.  meanwhile people thought they were getting actual food instead of inedible crap. 

i’d love to address this with uber but, of course, you can’t call uber on the phone.  if anybody knows a number please let me know!!

"psa- customer instructions. hi! this is just a little psa to those who order uber eats... as a driver, we get a name for the pickup and what was ordered. at best, we don't see the instructions until we have confirmed the pickup and are in the car about to pull away. by this point, the restaurant does not want us to come back because they're busy, and if there was no one there when we did the pickup, we're not going to flag someone down if you've put in the instructions that you would like an extra little bit of bbq sauce. if we do, depending on who we're dealing with and the day they have had, that is a good way to get your food messed with and sealed up before they hand it to us.

at worst, if you ask for something like a little extra bbq, we might not see it until we are pulling up to your house because the comment section is used to let us as drivers know if you would like us to set your food on a table because you can't bend down, to knock/ring or don't, and whether you want us to put it in a specific place you designated out of the open because people keep stealing your food.

the best way to get your special instructions met is to order it through the app. if you can't do that then the next best bet is to either call the restaurant and make your special request, or to nicely message the driver as soon you've been notified that someone has accepted the order... again, this is not to be rude. i figured that i would let you guys know that we can't see those special food instructions until we've already picked up the order and are supposed to be headed to you for drop off. so if you leave it in the comment section, it likely won't be met.",2024-05-09 17:06:20,6,4,Reddit,UberEats

"i was delivered a frozen kfc burger, and uber eats is refusing a refund  i can't believe this situation, but i ordered, among other things, a vegan burger. this was delivered with a frozen (not cold, literally frozen solid) patty, clearly refrigerated bun, and with lettuce and sauce on top - so it looked like someone arranged the burger correctly, just didn't cook any part of it. 

uber eats is now refusing to refund it for me saying:

we’ve verified this situation carefully and considering the delivery time didn’t meet our minimum requirements for the refund, we are unable to issue an adjustment this time.

they refuse to elaborate further no matter what i do, and just keep sending me an automated message about apologising for the temperature of the food not being to my liking. bloody hell, i wanted a burger, not an ice cream. 

does anyone have any advice for how to get my money back for this?

their response was [""as i checked your account, i see that you've received a significant number of compensation.  i am really sorry for this inconvenience, because of this, we're unable to offer additional compensation for this trip.""](https://imgur.com/a/sysuwzh)

mind you, i don't call in all that often, maybe once or twice a week when a store already handed out the order.  i won't even accept an order if it's from a restaurant that i think might have any chance of being closed because the drive is usually not worth the measly $3 compensation they hand out.  but to not give your contractors any compensation when they had spend around 45 minutes helping uber fix an issue with **their** system seems absolutely insane to me.

i'm just at a loss.  has this happened to anybody else?  am i expected to just abandon orders or am i really expected to wait on hold knowing i won't receive any compensation for my time?  sorry i know this is a bit of a rant but it's also meant to be a warning to other drivers who might not be aware of this yet.",2024-05-09 02:47:40,1,6,Reddit,UberEats

contacted multiple times thru the app, no answer for 9 minutes.

"do agents get in trouble for sending drivers up to a supervisor? so on sunday night, i did an alcohol order for a customer. apparently i was the second order since the first guy spoke little english, so the communication was hard to do. long story short, the first guy cancelled the order, so when i delivered the goods to her, she was praising how i really helped her with this delivery. well, an hour goes by, and i check to see that she took away the tip. so i do my usual thing and call uber support. the agent tells me the usual “wait an hour and see what happens” excuse. mind you, it’s been over 2 hours since i completed the order.

she then proceeded to follow the script of “well we can’t do anything because customer don’t have to tip you.” so i was like cool, let me speak to a supervisor then. she then says “the supervisor will tell you the same thing. and that there aren’t any supervisors available until 6 am tomorrow.” so at this point, i know she’s lying because i’ve done this process before. i guess they try to deter you from a supervisor, but i know better. so after a bit of back and forth of asking for a supervisor, she hangs up the phone on me. second time around, same script, but i was actually able to get a supervisor and they were able to reimburse me.

"charged for items not received  i order from unereats pretty regularly and have mostly been satisfied with their customer service when an item was incorrect or, in one case, my whole order wasn’t delivered (stolen by the driver i think). well today has been a rough monday so i decided to treat myself to some take out and order from one of my new favorite restaurants. when i got the order i realized part of it was missing, so i checked the receipt to make sure i did actually place that order. well the recipe did indicate that order but in sharpie had marked out that specific item and wrote ‘out’ beneath it. i did have a thought that maybe the driver took that item and re-stapled the bag, but unless they were incredibly careful and did not add extra holes, i don’t think that’s likely. so i reported the missing item to ubereats. they wanted a picture of the missing item…so since there is no item to show, i sent a picture of the receipt showing where it was marked out. i was repeatedly informed that this part of my order is not eligible for refund. i understand that people probably try to scam the system this way, but i’m just really frustrated and disappointed. i guess i should’ve just directly contacted the restaurant instead, but i’m not sure i could have gotten a refund that way either since i paid through uber. 
i think i may start ordering directly through restaurants for takeout in the future. not the end of the world, just frustrated. ",2024-05-06 23:17:26,1,3,Reddit,UberEats
"never seen high base pay.. for both orders on the stack i was driving down from having dinner back to home, and turned on uber to do deliveries on the way. i started getting stacked offers for this chinese restaurant (about 3 miles on the same road i was on) and all 5 offers were low.. less than $1 per mile. i kept rejecting them.

i literally passed the restaurant and within a quarter mile after passing, app offered crazy pay for a stacked order. $54 total for this chinese restaurant and another one. about 15 miles total so obviously i jumped at the offer. if i were to guess, the algorithm made a rash decision to throw this offer at me possibly because i was the last driver in the area and i have just now passed the restaurant.

turns out the order at the chinese restaurant was sitting for an hour!  at the second restaurant the food wasn't ready, but the base pay on that was high too. the first delivery paid $28, and the second one for $16. customers paid a combined tip of $2. lmao! obviously 2 pickups that everyone kept rejecting, but there is no way the food at both these restaurants combined could've been more than what uber paid me.. they were simple orders. pickup and dropoff locations were in normal demand areas, not isolated or anything.

"restaurants that yield the worst customers it sucks that this is a thing, but i can definitely see that there’s an obvious correlation with restaurants (if you want to call some of these that) or restaurant types and quality of tip/interaction with customers.  some of it isn’t even as obvious as one would suspect. i would go even as far to say time of day also plays into this.  obviously market and socio economic regions  effect this too but not going to base this on that too much.  not ready to break out a spreadsheet but just some reoccurring themes that i’ve noticed:
1) popeyes and wienerschnitzel late night, always a bad combo for me, no tips, tip baits and my only 2 thumbs downs (for absolutely no reason, leave at door so no customer interaction, correct address, food hot and packaging unmolested, made sure all items included, both left no comment as to why)
2) sit down bbq chains (ie famous dave’s, texas roadhouse) on weekends (usually sunday) for dinner. usually full family order, long distance out of town, customers paid over 80$ for food and service charges, tip maybe 2$ if they tip
3) trendy restaurants, booze or pizza for weekday dinner going near university rush hour weekdays. college kids don’t tip, always busy pick up at restaurant and difficult drops at dorm or apartment, with bad or no instructions how to navigate in the apartment. forget things like parking, gate codes, don’t meet at door when i arrive. never worth the effort or time. which is a bummer cuz pizza usually tips well (non caesar’s, it’s just built in to pizza delivery culture or something. 
4) fast food right by highschools going to hs
for lunch. never a tip, annoying drop table, always busy at the restaurant. this also made me feel so old realizing this is a normal thing now and so many kids it there’s a whole set up
for drivers to bring it to all the students ordering

any that i’m missing or more specific to your market?

also i’m surprised by mcdonald’s and jack in the box. i’d say 75% of the time there is a tip that makes sense for the delivery and distance. kudos to you

uber will not help at all. on the phone they either hang up on me or tell me a ticket it already open. i keep getting support emails closing tickets i open when i call that say i dont qualify for a refund because i did not reorder the food. we were starving and pissed at uber for not giving us an immediate refund so of course we just cooked something ourselves. they also try to ask for a photo of the food, or they claim i did not respond to them within 48 hours of ordering (obviously insanely untrue).

"(uber eats onboarding) how fucked am i? hey all,

4 months ago i tried to get onboarded at uber eats. but i stupidly selected the busiest and worst city in my area (paris) and waited a month only to figure that it'd probably be years before i was accepted, due to how saturated it is.

after contacting support they told me i couldn't change my city. so i had no choice but to delete that account and make a new one. but my own smaller city was also full and i waited another month with no response.

after that, also stupidly, i made a total of 4 accounts (each time deleting the old one) to try and game the system. i tried a nearby small town, which is apparently what everyone is doing these days, but also waited weeks with no answer.

finally a few days ago, i met a guy who told me he was accepted in just one week after choosing the town we were in, which is right next to mine, and as big/busy as mine. wtf? so i tried to jump on the opportunity too: i deleted my account again, remade one, aaand it got instantly locked.

[and this is the reply i got from support.](https://i.imgur.com/dyicyj3.png)

the next thing i tried was make a new account with a different phone number (that i got just for this) and email. but same ip address and, of course, my full name... since they'll verify with my id card anyway, right? instantly locked again.

i tried once again this time with a different ip address, device, and a slightly misspelled name, instalocked. i believe their database probably instantly blacklisted that second phone number as well.

just now i tried to have a friend make an account with all of their info, but my self-employed business (required here in france), because i'm not about to ask my friend to make his own business and pay more taxes for me. as expected, since it's my name and not his on the documents, uber isn't accepting them.

i'm at my wit's end. i probably dug myself too far down.

in my town, i see _lots_ of illegal uber eats drivers. they have told me themselves the accounts they use are not theirs. one guy told me he rents his for like 200€ a month (or was it a week?). i'm a legal citizen who just wants to make a few bucks on the side and enjoy riding my bike. i fucked up by making so many accounts but it feels... it just feels really stupid.

i'm really disappointed. i'm on stuart right now, but i get about... oh, 5 times less orders than uber drivers. i go hours without orders. i was really looking forward to being able to stay out and stay active instead of waiting so much. i also signed up onto deliveroo 4 months ago and i'm just waiting.

"honor amongst thieves  i know this sub has a hard-on for anyone that delivers on a 'bike' when they're really in a car. i can admit for almost the first six years i was on this app (aug. 2018-apr. 2024) i did that. and i'm sure a lot of you doth protest too much and do it too, but i digress. whether you think it is wrong or not, it doesn't matter. we all know why people do it. and a large reason has to do with distance on trips.

we all know uber thinks of us as worthless drivel, so personally i didn't care that i was lying to them. because, like the title says there is no honor amongst thieves, and they thieve us all the time. because a customer reported that i was in a car and not on a bike, i recently had to switch to a car. while some of you can gloat and say karma, i say it's a step back for us all. (side note: how was i to carry two packs of water bottles on a bike)

attached is an example of a common order i now get because i had to switch. none of us would take that, well i'm sure some of you would with all the grandstanding you all do. but do we think this is fair and right? why is this type of order even allowed? especially in new jersey where everything is much more dense and a lot more traffic. if i now have to be more ethical and be honest, why do they then get to play in our face like that. i get nothing but orders of this nature now, and it's garbage. who should bother atp?

i think more than anything we should asking for trip limits. sweet churros is 2.3 miles from my house, why should anyone be able to order that far (19 miles). for example, no one would order jollibee from time square and have it delivered to harlem it's only six miles but a ridiculous waste of time. customers don't even realize they do this too, sometimes i'll get a request for a target order and i'll pass a closer target on the way to the persons residence. while i knew it was wrong to say i'm on a bike, but i'm glad i was for all this time. criticize me all you want, but you know i'm telling the truth.

i have been working with uber eats for approximately a week, and my most profitable day so far has been $75 in 5 hours. i have tried working with both uber eats and uberx, but i prefer uber eats as i have earned more from it. as this is my second job, i am available to work three days a week and i do not work on weekends due to my main career commitments. any suggestions on what i can do to maximize my earnings? thank you in advance.",2024-05-03 18:46:48,16,106,Reddit,UberEats
"scheduled order delivered way too early, no support help i have my two kids to plan dinner for fridays. as a treat we were doing pizza night anyway i scheduled a pizza order for when i’d be getting home from picking them both up. leaving and getting back for this can take over an hour.

the order arrived minutes after i left the house instead with me already in traffic.

i contacted support who said they’d escalate and get back to me within 1-2 days!

the food will be sitting outside for an hour because either the app or the restaurant did this order wrong.

if they sent me the complete wrong order i assume i’d get a refund but in this case it was uh we will get back to you.

i tried contacting support through chat instead and that agent just took 5 mins to respond then said nothing could be done and when i started to ask why they just ended the chat. the phone agent just hung up on me mid sentence.

"uber driver - delivery nj ok, i know my exp isn’t as long as other drivers but from what i’ve learned so far this are areas i’d avoid due to a high number of low paying orders. imo uber shouldn’t even allow service there. 

- newark, either stolen orders, low pay and a huge number of bikes/motorcycles

- elizabeth, although some restaurant are good, most orders aren’t that good and too many desperate drivers taking $3-$6 orders for almost the same amount of miles which is crazy, it’s also a very rare tipping zone. 

- plainfield, i’ve never gotten any good orders and usually uber matches long distance/low pay orders such as $6/20miles or $10-$15 for an hour ride. 

- edison, not ever have i gotten a decent order to that place. 

- carteret, same as edison, but i’ve seen some drivers take orders (awful ones like crazy) 

- east orange, although not as bad as the other ones but imo, low tips and barely decent orders. i usually take orders on my way home so i make an extra. 

- paterson, this one is obvious so no need to explain. 

and on a personal note, i understand we all try to make a living and earn some money but i’m completely against motorcycles, i’ve witnessed how good zones have become low paying ones due to motorcycles joining, a clear example is montclair, usually good af but after winter i’ve seen motorcycles and the good and short trips are now paying as any other zones. because they take whatever they can and yeah kinda ruin the market.

"had to return alcohol for the first time and lost money i had an alcohol delivery during the day a few days ago and the customer didn’t have a valid id. 

so can’t deliver it and uber says i need to take it back to the store (10 mile trip back) and i will get pay to return it to the store. 

what they failed to mention is that the return pay is garbage and they have now taken away the tip from the trip which was more than the return pay. as a result i’m now out $3 from what was promised for the trip when i had to do an extra return trip on top.

i’m typically a doordash driver and they never take the tip away when you go the full distance even if you need to return it.

uber really shouldn’t give a full refund to the customer and we should get paid as expected for our time when we do the full trip.

lesson learned is to not take longer distance alcohol deliveries for uber.",2024-05-03 07:36:22,7,19,Reddit,UberEats

so they can rob me as much as they want, but if i say one thing, i m somehow treated as the thief? that only happens because so many people report not legitimate issues that it punishes the good reports by making them look like fraudsters. how is this legal?

so, my problem is with using an uber eats account is that you sometimes need to take a photo of yourself before going online. i have 2 questions, how often do you need to take this picture, and if i can use an android virtual camera to project a picture of my mom’s face so that it goes online. the app doesn’t use any 3d scanners on your phone (because some phones don’t even have it), so projecting an image should theoretically work. correct me if i’m wrong.

i’m not going to complain but i am just curious to if it is deemed okay to do or not? as personally i wouldn’t have done that in any customer facing jobs i’ve had. i feel like it’s pretty standard to not comment on a persons appearance when delivering food but i also do think maybe he might have had some issues with what’s deemed appropriate. 

i did have one incident before where i did complain about a driver but that’s because he decided to text my number outside of delivering my food. (as in later on after delivery was completed). i complained about that as i felt very uncomfortable with him getting my number through the app and also knowing where i lived.

"delivery returns - customer not home/unable to contact **anyone else have some retail deliveries that you have had to return?** 

today i picked up 2 orders at apple store, with a solid delivery pay versus miles. i delivered the first order without issue, but the second one...

a home address in the middle of the day (around 12:30pm), i texted ""apple store delivery on the way"" in advance. then when i got there ""i've arrived"" - no reply.

i rang the 3 different doorbells (the customer did not specify which floor was theirs - a 3 story home with multiple mailboxes on front). no answer. i knocked on all 3 doors. waited. no answer. i called and got voicemail. left a message. ... ... doorbells again... no answer. i walked around back to see if perhaps they were there... nope.

i had driven 24 miles to deliver both orders (the pay was $37 combined). after waiting 20 mins (uber app recommended i return the apple device - which was again 24 miles back to the store)... i called the customer, explaining why i did not deliver their iphone. i told them to contact apple store or uber. then i grudgingly drove the 24 miles back and returned the iphone.

3 hours later, my phone rang. it was the customer asking where the hell his phone was. i told him everything above and he said i should have just left it on his doorstep. i explained it was a signature required $1200 purchase. i did not want to take the risk of someone stealing it and having to repay that for a bad delivery without a proper signature. (what i did not say - as well as him possibly claiming he never got it even if he did)...

i told him to contact apple store and uber support. i had returned his phone to apple, so it was still at that store.

all in all, i drove a round-trip of 50 miles for this. through heavy chicago traffic.

this is why - when i take deliveries - i usually try to keep it within 10 miles or less. ",2024-04-28 21:50:55,7,8,Reddit,UberEats

"was i in the wrong? hi all, 

i’m in my 3rd week of doing ubereats and i’m going pretty well so far. 

last night i had my first run in with a difficult order and i’d like to know what everyone else thinks.

so, it was a “meet at door” order. the destination was an apartment building in a very busy area of sydney. right outside the apartment building there’s plenty of foot traffic and there’s a ton of bus stops too.

so i got there with the order, messaged the person to say i’ve arrived and waited 3 minutes for them to respond.
they told me they weren’t home and gave me the code to complete the order but they also asked me if i could put it somewhere private.

as i mentioned earlier, it was peak hour in this particular part of sydney where there was a whole lot of foot traffic going to different bars, restaurants etc. so, i told them there isn’t really anywhere private i can leave their food and i can’t get into their building to put it in a safe place. again, it took them a lot longer than i’d have liked to reply to me, by now the 5 minute timer had been long past 0. 
they asked if there was anywhere private on the street i could leave it. like i should know??? it’s their street they live on!

i replied and said the best i could do is put it under the bench at the bus stop right in front of the door to their apartments.

then this doofus seriously had the gall to ask me to wait until they get home. 
i had enough and out of frustration left the food under the aforementioned bench, told them where it was (with a picture attached) and ended the order before they can message me again and went on my merry way.

an hour later i happened to drive past that same spot and the food was still sitting right where i left it.
so either they couldn’t find their food or they just weren’t home yet. 

am i in the wrong for doing what i did?

edit: thanks everyone for the replies! 
i forgot to mention there was no lobby in this building, just a door to a small corridor with an elevator in it. only residents can access.

at about 5:45pm my order was cancelled by the restaurant with the excuse that there was an issue with the driver.  i reordered because i didn't have any groceries to cook and i can't drive.  after 30 minutes with no progress, i contacted support again and after a long conversation was told i could cancel my order but still be charged for.

"i think switching to nights is killing my ratings. i got a job during the day, so when i drive, it's just evenings. i usually start heading home around 10 pm when things noticeably go to hell, but i'll stay out as long as i can keep getting orders worth taking.

for years before this, i would go out in the morning and come home early evening unless i got swept up in a good dinner rush. ever since i switched in january, the job has gotten noticeably grittier. i'm going to crappier areas to crappier people, stolen orders are way up, and the other drivers i run into scare me almost as much as the strung out teenagers they shuffle in to work the packed restaurants that stayed open. more than ever, i'm questioning what the hell i'm doing out there.

i've been doing this since 2021 and my ratings have always been between 98-100%. i don't do asinine stuff. i look somewhat presentable, i make small talk when they do (and i don't force it when they don't), i only drive straight to the restaurant and then straight to them with the order. i use thermal bag when it makes sense, i check orders when it makes sense to, and i follow delivery instructions when they make sense. my car is clean and i communicate if things come up. i have absolutely no idea who the hell is downvoting me, but as of today i'm down to 92%.

i'm pretty sure about two of them. one guy had a delivery note saying there was a cash tip inside an open cabinet next to the door. there very clearly wasn't, which happens often enough. then the mfer retracted the $2.00 he tipped on the app and downvoted me. dude was clearly just trying his hardest to be a giant pos, and uber eats is all for it. the other one had delivery notes saying ""make sure they included everything! they always leave out the chips and i'm paying for them!"" it was a stacked order and i didn't even get this until i was down the road from his house. of course i felt the bag and there were definitely no chips in there. my rating lowered a percent within an hour of completing that order.

as for the rest of them though, i have absolutely no idea. i wish they at least had to provide a reason or something. i've done about 400 orders on uber eats and none of the bad ones have dropped yet. i feel like people are more likely to pile on when they see someone with lower ratings. i can't stand how much power these absolute pukes have over random people they're not even tipping.",2024-04-27 00:53:23,11,4,Reddit,UberEats

so out of curiosity, why don't ubereats drivers give a reason for why they cancel?

edit: thank you to everyone who responded. i don't know what the drivers side looks like on ubereats, so this gave me some insight. i have also learned that ubereats is not a great company to work for, which i sort of knew before but now i can really see how much people hate driving for them. 

i agree that ubereats should be doing their part and contacting customers when an order is unassigned (i said canceled above, but now know unassigned is the more correct term). 

that also explains why when i contacted customer support after the 5th person (the one that sent me a message letting me know the store was closed) support immediately knew what was wrong. ",2024-04-26 14:14:13,25,65,Reddit,UberEats
"my account got deactivated because of 1% low rating.  i started uber eats with uber walk and cycle and had trouble delivering food like sometimes it gets messy inside because of no proper packing. then i got a car and doing uber eats and i always make things on time. i completed almost 300 deliveries. when i face problems i call uber support. 2 days back, i faced a roadblock in two highways because of some event in toronto and i had to call the uber support and they cancelled the order. i wasted two hours for the delivery and they cancelled the two orders. that's all i remember about my past orders. i had 84% satisfaction which should have been 85%. i made an appeal and still they turn down it by permanently deactivated my account. it says i didn't follow community guidelines. may i ask is there any way, that i can do uber eats? i usually do it casually.

"am i unjustified in being annoyed by this? ordered food last night and put a 25% tip on it, which is my default. total tip amount was ~$20.

the delivery started to run a bit late, say by 15 minutes. (total wait time was around an hour and change.)

as the driver was getting close to the restaurant, he messaged me suggesting that i increase my tip given “how busy it is right now.” i also noticed the app said he had multiple stops. 

i was pretty annoyed by this as i believe a 25% tip is good and it felt like first world nation problem extortion. “pay me more or perhaps you’ll never see your food.”

i didn’t reply and watched his little monopoly car move across the uber app map. he passed right by my house and went a few streets over to do his other delivery. clearly they must have increased their tip amount. 

i was already getting annoyed with ubereats after a delivery last week took almost 2 hours to get to my house and there were 3 driver reassignments. i had to contact uber support to get them to help as the restaurant wouldn’t let me just change the order to pickup. so i was already a bit soured before this second incident.

is this just normal behavior and i should get over it? or am i right in thinking this is ridiculous and next time i should just get my lazy ass in the car to pick up our food myself? ",2024-04-26 12:43:11,59,79,Reddit,UberEats

"what's the realistically reasonable tip? (uk) i get that deliveries are a really tough way to make money and while wishing the base pay took care of that, accept it doesn't. 

my door is around 500 yds from the nearest parking - further than most front doors, unless you're in a high rise, i guess. i'm disabled and it's usually tricky for me to get to the curbside but don't want to be a pain in the arse to deliver to. 

how far from the vehicle would you drivers usually go on typical deliveries? how far before you are thinking ""i wish there was x tip to make this worthwhile"" and how much is ""x"" if it's a 500yd walk?

i had no idea how the system works for drivers the 1st couple of orders i tried and didn't get the food following oddly confusing conversations with drivers who in hindsight i realise were really giving up on a bad job. i wonder if i had added a bigger tip it would be more worth their while persisting? 

i sympathise ... but don't have a lot of income (delivered cooked food is a rare luxury) ... but don't want to be guilty of accidentally forcing drivers to work only for the base pay especially when it's made worse than usual ...  and i don't know how it seems from the drivers' perspective...

"driver took my order last week my bf and i hadn’t had dinner yet and had to leave to go to a meeting, so i ordered some donairs and even paid for the priority delivery. i am a very good tipper, usually around 25-30%. 

anyway, i can see from the tracking that the driver was going all over town and was nowhere near me, and that the “arrival time” kept increasing and nearing the time we had to leave for our meetings. 

as i’m about to text the driver, i see that he’s now heading in my direction, so i thought i’d keep my cool and just wait. a few minutes later i get the “get ready, your driver is 2 minutes away” and i’m like great! we’re hungry!

i’m looking out my window, i hear a car out in the lane, when i get a text with “your order was delivered” and i jumped out of my seat and ran to the back door. i went the lane and there was a man turning himself around in the lane and i’m saying “hey! excuse me!” and he speeds off!

i was so mad, but more than that, i was so disappointed because my boyfriend had no idea i’d ordered the donairs and i was planning on surprising him with them and not only that, there goes almost $47 out the effin window!

i texted the driver but got no response and i got in contact with ubereats and they were pretty good, refunded my card for the entire amount but that totally sucked. especially since earlier that day at work i’d ordered starbucks for my coworker and i through ubereats and we had no problems. just ugh! 😑 ",2024-04-26 10:52:44,0,7,Reddit,UberEats

there was one guy who ran out to my car after i gave him his order and told me he got the wrong food. i said, “oh, i’m sorry, i just took what the restaurant handed to me for you, i don’t actually look at what’s in the bag because it’s sealed, but if it’s not right you’ll need to call ubereats and straighten it out with them.” he was like, “oh, ok, no worries, thank you,” but now i wonder if he was mr. thumbs down.

i was not aware that there was a certain method i had to go through to cancel the order and just selected cancel order. because of this i am apparently not eligible for a refund. i have tried to dispute this with uber but they are only acknowledging the fact that i cancelled the order after it was accepted by the restaurant and ignoring any other aspects of my help and support submissions. 

does anyone know of a way to remedy this, i have spoken to their call centre who informed me they can only help with live orders and have escalated it on my behlaf, but the escalation just leads me back to being informed that i am not eligible for a refund.

"delivery guy compliment! & uber app observation **i need to compliment my food delivery guy from yesterday:** i was at my son's soccer practice and made a repeat chipotle order, timed for when we were supposed to get home. because one can place orders in the main uber app, i was using that. right after placing the order i realized that without selecting a new location the app had locked in my current location (soccer field) rather than my default, home address. i messaged the delivery guy because i couldn't find a way to cancel the order or update delivery location, and **he was so cool** about delivering to our house once he understood what was happening! i added in-app review to make sure you guys knew he repped well!

**that brings me to the app observations born from the experience above:** today i downloaded the actual uber eats app to see if it's different--and it definitely has nuanced functionality that i did not see for food delivery in the main uber app. then a couple of things from trying to review:

* in the eats app i see  one can simply reorder a previous order \*with all details\* with the click of button--once you go into ""carts"" to previous orders. in the main uber app it only brought up the previous items ordered, but made me re-select all the proteins, toppings etc. all over again for each item
* if it were me, i would add the option, to repeat full order, on the restaurant page as well so one doesn't have to re-navigate if they decide they want the same thing again after perusing the menu. better ux.
* in the main app, i couldn't find a way to simply review the delivery person like you can drivers. maybe you can in the eats app.
* to contact you to let you know how awesome the delivery guy was, i had to login in with a browser and go to the order, then support -- there was no actual delivery review for the driver except negative options like ""my delivery person was rude"" or ""my food was damaged."" it would be cool to also have a ""compliment"" option. i ended up finding the most generic one and then explaining my compliment in the details section.

hope this made sense and kudos again to the delivery guy--he made that way easier than i thought it would be!

i’ve been tipping 20% usually. 25% if it’s a long drive. 30% in bad weather. minimum of $10. so this month, for example, i tipped $43 on an order that was 16 miles away and $8 on an order that was 2 miles away (didn’t tip the full $10 this time because part of my order was missing, then later delivered, but it was cold by the time i got it because i didn’t know it had been dropped off after i got the rest of the order). 

or i guess a better question is, how should i determine tips? maybe a certain percentage per mile away? or just keep doing what i’m doing?

"my driver called me after the delivery (tip related) i had a huge order for a lunch the other day near fort wayne, indiana. it came to over $425. the order was from one restaurant and fairly straightforward. i gave the restaurant plenty of time, and i knew one driver could easily deliver it all to the building i needed the food to go to.

my driver was courteous and kind. the restaurant was running behind and my driver kept me updated and texted me what was going on. he confirmed the address before leaving the restaurant, not wanting to make the food later than what it already was. all solid uber driver actions. 

i had pre-added what i thought a reasonable and “garden-variety” tip was on the order (did not add after delivery.) 15%. which was about $65. my driver called me about an hour after my lunch. i slightly panicked thinking something had gone wrong. no. he just called me to thank me for the tip. it was a friday and he just wanted to thank me for starting his weekend off on a good foot.

isn’t 15% just average? i didn’t think i went above and beyond? i mean the order was very large, so i get 15% comes out to be bigger, but that’s not me, that’s just math, right? what am i missing?",2024-04-23 01:36:25,1566,458,Reddit,UberEats

"used to do uber eats back in 2020, am i doing something wrong? hey reddit.

for context: i am in toronto.

i used to do uber eats back in 2020 when i was out of a job just to keep myself afloat. back then, i was making around 20-25 dollars an hour depending on tips and it was never difficult to get requests. considering gas, i would say i was still making 18-22 an hour roughly.

i am thankfully working now but i decided to try uber eats again on a sunday during dinner time to see if it was viable for some side cash. i have to say it's a stark difference now and i can't help but to ask if i am doing something incorrect.

firstly, it took me 10 minutes to get my first request, i thought something was glitched so i went online and offline a good 5 times and even contacted support lol. after i got my 1st request, subsequent ones came quicker, but i was waiting an average of 2-5 minutes per request. this is a big difference from 2020 when i was getting requests every minute.

secondly, some of the requests i was getting were terrible. ex, 2 dollars for a 20-minute delivery? to be clear, i got some of those occasionally even in 2020 but you would only get those once in a while. you would just deny it and wait for a better one. however, now, you reject it, and you have to wait 2-5 minutes for another request and the one that comes is just as bad, i reject it again, etc. and this results in so much downtime.

third, this one i don't have enough data to confirm this since this was just one session but the tips have decreased severely. half my deliveries did not tip and the ones that did - my biggest tip was 3 dollars. it sucks but i can't blame them. i understand that most people are struggling to get by with how expensive things are.

all this resulted in me making an average of 14.70 an hour before accounting for gas which was a shocker. it doesn't feel worth it to do this even as a side hustle anymore due to the wear on my car.

does anyone have tips for better success? or is this just how it is now? it's funny because the reason i tried it again was because i got this email on my phone from uber asking me to start driving again. in the email, it details all these statistics, among them - saying that drivers made an average of 30 something an hour. which was why i gave it a shot lol.

i contact customer support, of course theyre useless. it takes 5 separate conversations before i get to anyone legitimate and all they do is give me $20 and say that im a driver but theres nothing else they can do. 

they cant review it due to privacy policy and now my record is stuck with a negative rating which they cant remove because its essentially hard coded into the app.

"general issues... driver support doesn't care. things that need fixed: 

when i am at the delivery location, within 150 meters and the delivery offer alert goes off....  
i am trying not to kill anyone, crash into anyone, block traffic, or crash into a parked car. meanwhile, the offer alert is going berserk! it is nonstop and distracting. yes, i could turn the sound off, but i sould not have to.  
i have reported it multiple times.  
within 200 meters of the delivery location, most of us are driving slow, looking out the windows to try and find the dark brown wood numbers on the black or dark brown background of the house we are delivering to... house numbers in obscure and inconsistent places, if they exist at all... we are trying to park safely, while - behind us there are a dozen impatient cars with drivers wondering why we are driving so slowly or stopping in the middle of the road just to look at our phone and hit the ""x"" or the accept button.  
this should be fixed.  
how? make the app stop offering new orders when the driver is within 200 meters of the drop off location.

2.  
side streets with 1000 stop signs as the preferred route to the fast-moving main roadway 1-2 blocks off to the side.  
idk why uber's gps is all fucked up about this. it may possibly be a more direct route? but having to accelerate, roll over a speed hump, and stop, then repeat that 20-50 times is insane.  
i know i could use another gps option, but i prefer not to have to switch back and forth.

3.  
""turn slightly right"" when there is no turn at all. this happens in the suburbs of major towns where every 2-4 miles the road you are on changes names or registrations on the gps. example: grand avenue from chicago out to the far nw suburbs remains the same, but switches direction every 5 miles or so. however, the gps keeps saying to turn slightly left or slightly right to continue on grand ave. when there is no gd change in direction at all.  
this is true of the expressways as well. every off-ramp is listed as the main route and continuing on the expressway is considered a ""keep left"" or ""turn slightly left"" to stay on the expressway. wtf? fix it please.

4.  
vegetable/fruit/produce food weights.  
this has improved slightly. a year ago, shop & pay orders for produce were impossible to fulfill.  
irl, 1 banana weighs between 0.6-0.8 lb. according to uber's app, the maximum weight of 1 banana is 0.5 lb. so whenever a customer ordered 7 bananas, we would be limited to buying them 4 or 5. ditto with peppers, onions, apples, oranges, etc.  
in many cases, this has been fixed after a year of complaining to support about it. now, it asks how many bananas instead of asking for a precise weight, most of the time.

5.  
the new ""hand-to-hand"" deliveries.  
what?  
well, the past few days, i have had ""package"" pickups where i literally pull up to the curb and someone hands me something, then i deliver it across town to someone else standing on the curb over there.  
yesterday, it was literally a teenager handing me a folder with a term paper, which i delivered to another teenager.  
today, it was a jogging suit top. no box, no bag, just the item on its own lying in my passenger seat.  
it's a bit sus.

you get what you pay for.  so if you’re wondering if a $3 tip is enough.  sure.  for cold food and drinks with melted ice.

"can i reinstate ordering alcohol from my uber account after deactivating it, as a customer.  so i cancelled uber alcohol delivery a long time ago for health reasons, but mostly cause i had people using my account jointly that it wasn’t healthy for them (they are better now but what a ride that was). ordering alcohol through uber wasn’t really my thing and was just dangerous for what you got. it seemed safer at the time. 

now, where i am located, it seems very convenient. issue arising is i deleted this function. i am now around those with healthy habits, so it’s not an issue, including with myself. 
i want to know if there is a way to reinstate the alcohol delivery (with obvious nods to responsibility) on the app ? seems like there isint and i’m not willing to make a new login just to get a wine bottle. ",2024-04-21 07:41:46,0,1,Reddit,UberEats
"which is better i am fairly new to working ue, i have read countless posts on the great debate between ue and doordash. i’ve read people make the most money from ue, while others hate it and make the most money from dd. 

i’m obviously going to try dd to see what it’s like in my city but i want any of your feedback if you’ve worked both, which paid more? please. 

thank you 🤍",2024-04-21 04:58:05,1,7,Reddit,UberEats

"why steal alcohol  i get that sometimes uber drivers steal food, but to steal alcohol is something that could get you in trouble. today i went to pick up a somewhat large alcohol order and found out that i was the 5th delivery driver to come for the order. i called uber support and told them about what happen and they filled a police report. if your gonna steal a large amount of alcohol don’t do it with uber 🫠🙄 ",2024-04-20 22:51:16,46,42,Reddit,UberEats
