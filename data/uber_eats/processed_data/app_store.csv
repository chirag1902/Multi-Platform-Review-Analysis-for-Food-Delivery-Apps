2024-04-20 07:08:47,"When I first installed Uber Eats I was having amazing experiences so far with me getting out of work late and still getting food quickly delivered to my door late at night. However, I cannot say the same anymore. Uber Eats does not have the correct availability of a store in their app anymore and tonight I ordered from multiple different stores and my orders kept getting cancelled because of drivers stealing my food (I found this out by calling the restaurant just for them to advice me that someone already picked up my order and left). I don’t know what has gotten into drivers or the app having incorrect store hours posted for several stores but this is getting out of hand. At this point I would recommend ordering from DoorDash as they do have the correct store hours posted and have the correct menu prices instead of charging extra on the food and still charging many fees. I’m truthfully disappointed in the app and the fact that they allow drivers get away with stealing food.",1,App Store,UberEats
2024-04-21 19:18:18,"Had a missing item, let the driver know, they just shrugged and left. Reached out to support, they said they couldn’t help me, provided no explanation, and continued to close out the ticket. Deleting the app, canceled my Uber one, I’ll go pick up my food if it means I’ll have a complete order. What’s the point in paying fees for priority/uberone/delivery if you can have missing items that they decide they don’t have to reimburse you for.

Update:

My questions still weren’t answered, but after the third time of reaching out to support I reached some sort of resolution. They refunded the order (which was not asked for, realistically I would’ve preferred they had someone deliver the missing item). Wish my questions were still answered and I didn’t have to run in circles for support, but I’ll change it from a 1 star rating to a 3 star rating.",3,App Store,UberEats
2024-04-22 04:22:42,"There’s only a dropdown menu with very limited options on what the issue is, and NO ability to submit a report unless it’s with an order that has already been placed. Currently, a promotion that was given to me from the app, through the app, is completely glitched and unusable. When I click “shop now” to see the list of restaurants that are eligible for this 40% coupon that I recognize because I get sent it every couple weeks and I can usually use it with no issue, I get sent to my front page of the app. Okay, no problem right? Seems like maybe it’s available for any of the restaurants then. NOPE. It’s literally unusable for anything. I don’t know if this is something they don’t care about because they think hunger will make me just decide to get the food anyways, but if I get my hopes up thinking I’m going to get 40% (up to $15) and then I go to check out and it’s full price? I’d rather starve than spend that extra $15 I thought I had saved.",1,App Store,UberEats
2024-04-22 19:35:07,"I used Uber eats for years. I even had an Uber one membership on and off for a while. I deleted my information a from the app today and deleted the app off my phone. 

Why? Because they have a policy that unfairly punishes the customer for wrong orders from the restaurants. 

I have had this happen a few times recently, but I finally had enough. I receive an order, something is missing completely or is wrong from what I ordered, so I submit that with photos and a description… except now instead of being given credit or a partial refund, I am told my order is not eligible for a refund. On Reddit this seems to be because over the course of my entire UberEATS membership, I’ve submitted too many. Unfortunately, the restaurants mess up orders frequently. But I should not have to pay for things I did not receive. I should not have to pay if they send me a sandwich when I ordered a salad. Especially at the prices being charged. That means I could spend $25 on food and the driver could bring me an empty bag and they would not refund me. It’s crazy. 

I tried explaining this to customer service and asked to speak to a supervisor and kept receiving the same response over and over again that my order was not eligible. They would not cite the policy or give any additional information. 

So I deleted. And you should too until they can provide transparency in these unfair policies.",1,App Store,UberEats
2024-04-23 11:20:33,"I’ve had really bad experiences with most delivery apps but this one surely takes the cake in how suspicious they are. If you’re a young adult on limited money or anyone in general who wants to keep your money, please don’t use this. 
I ordered food almost three days ago that I had to go pick up myself and I had one charge for that. Today when I’d gotten my check deposited, I noticed an unusual charge from my account that was “pending” and was pulled at freakin 3am. First of all I was asleep at this time and didn’t order Jack squat! Second of all it was for an order I did ALMOST THREE DAYS AGO AND WAS ALREADY CHARGED FOR. Why are you pulling money out of my account AGAIN. When I spoke to customer service they said it was a hold that would fall off. However you still pulled the money at an odd time, and you could have left me in the negative??? See how bad that sounds? This is my second bad experience, in conclusion I will not be using these services again.",2,App Store,UberEats
2024-04-24 19:06:14,"Typically you expect to get everything that you order, and can hold the courier or store responsible. However, when it happens quite often, the only fault goes to Uber Eats simply because there’s some sort of disconnect why there are different couriers and different stores to fulfill orders and completion to customers because I’m not the only one. Unacceptable given that Uber eats profits lots of revenue from being the “middle man”. Perhaps set some proper expectations or true consequences or risk losing customers. in fact, Uber eats is superior to one of the other courier services stopped for the same reason but the environment makes me want to order directly from restaurants, make my own food or go out to eat rather than rely on food delivery. I’m tired of receiving “credits” and refunds. I want to receive a full order consistently given that I order quite a bit from Uber Eats.",3,App Store,UberEats
2024-04-25 00:49:22,"I used Uber eats today along with my promo. My total came up to 2.48 and I tipped 1.00 which made my total 3.48. I used 1.33 in Uber cash and the rest was charged to my account. After this order my account says that I owe 1.00, after look at the receipt and my bank statement it shows everything was paid in full, i reached out to customer twice the first representative IAN was rude, he cut the chat short while I was still confused. I chatted with another representative who was nice but could not resolve the issue and transferred me to someone else. I’ve been using Uber for years and never had this problem. I’m disappointed because I am not being heard and this issue is not being resolved. I would suggest everyone to check their receipt and statement after each order in case you are over charged a 1.00 or anything. This is a hard time for me and I use Uber and Uber eats often and it saddens me that this is happening. It makes wonder how many other times have I been over charged.",3,App Store,UberEats
2024-04-25 12:16:50,"This past time I submitted that both my drink and fries were missing from the order. I was missing 2/3 of my order. So I rated my order and submitted that I didn’t receive those things. About a week or two later still no reach out and no refund. So I went through the help center and explained a part of it. Well your service team responded said no refund and closed the ticket. No chance to write back and I can’t make any more claims about it and there’s no where else to contact any support. Your app support is absolutely terrible. Why can I not chat with someone real time? Why can I not call someone real time? So you know what, I canceled all of my Uber Apps because you guys essentially stole money from me when the drink is the drivers fault and the sweet potato fries is the restaurants fault. You really need to explain when you’re “rating” the order that that’s not how you’re supposed to go about getting a refund. In fact rating makes 0 difference and does absolutely nothing because if the guy had maybe looked into my account he would’ve seen that I did rate my order within 24 hours of the order arriving. I did it right then and there before I even ate the sandwich which was only 1/3 of my meal. So I won’t be going through Uber for anything anymore. I’m using Lyft for rides and other food delivery services from now on. You used to be my go to, I even worked with the company but you just stole money from me.",1,App Store,UberEats
2024-04-27 08:24:44,I’ve been trying to give Uber eats a chance time after time because they have great deals but for the past year I’ve received half orders or totally wrong orders from merchants. Just recently I had two orders that were wrong I sent photos of raw cooked shrimp from red lobster and a whole kids meal missing and they only refunded $7. Then just yesterday my daughter ordered from McDonald’s and only got 2 items out of 5 a whole meal was incomplete and a sandwich. I reported it and was told no refund is due I sent two pictures one of what we received and one of the receipt the person responding from their customer service says from the photo it matches the receipt REALLY!!  I do not like how they are turning against the customers now who have repeated issues and now it’s to the point we can’t even get honesty from the company. No phone number to speak directly to anyone and I was totally disregarded. I’ve spent a lot of money with Uber eats and I can say this is by far the worse I’ve experienced.,1,App Store,UberEats
2024-04-28 14:27:47,"I ordered McDonald’s last night already scared I wasn’t going to get my order because the drivers kept bouncing back and forth as to who was to pick up my order. A driver finally picks up my order and I’m relieved because it’s been a long day and I just wanted to eat. I get the notifications the drive is outside and when I go out I see that he is literally driving past my house so I try and flag him down using my flashlight and he drives away faster knowing he obviously seen me. So I go out and try to meet him and he drives off even more, which leads me to running. He didn’t expect me to catch up to him so I knocked on the window, he sees me and drives off completely. I trying to talk to him to tell him I was meeting him to get my order and he drove off so fast I hurt myself trying to meet him and when I showed Customer service what happened they had no response. I am highly disappointed in this service. I could not get in contact with anyone to talk about what actually happened and I am still very hurt after last night’s incidents. I will be telling people in the future to not use this app or service because for me to get almost injured due to a driver basically stealing my food in my face and having no response from Uber Eats or even a agent from within the chat of my order shows there is little to no care for the customers using this app. I am beyond disappointed and to say my experience with this app is a disgrace is beyond that.",1,App Store,UberEats
2024-04-30 00:03:55,"Drivers who have a hard time finding the area don’t reach out to the customers, and end up placing the food on the wrong door. This has happened many times to me and my friends living in the same complex. We usually go for DoorDash but thought the switch was needed as we heard good things about the app. We were wrong, every order pretty much was delivered to the wrong house so we never received the grocery’s or the fast food. Contacting support is pointless because they refuse to give refunds or price adjustments, or even to get on the phone to discuss it. Drivers don’t answer their phones either so you cannot quickly let them know that they left the order in the wrong house—- in the hopes they could fetch it back and deliver it correctly.

In short, Uber is a mess with the drivers and they don’t want to help customers who never received their products. I recommend going to DoorDash where they deliver things right and make sure to help the customers.",1,App Store,UberEats
2024-05-04 16:13:09,"On multiple times I’ve received orders with missing food items or sometimes the restaurant will just cancel the order all together. On this last time May 2nd I ordered from PF Chang’s. 

The delivery driver arrived but I was dealing with the children so my wife picked up the order at the curb. I came down to the kitchen to find just one bag with a single appetizer and desert and a box of rice. We ordered 8 items total. Two entrees, other apps and sushi. The total was $130 and so I went to the app to get help. I had the option to reach out to the driver and he said that was all they gave him at the restaurant. He said my bad and he would report the missing items and I could do the same in the app. I did an didn’t receive a response. Usually they tell you right away we apologize for the mistake. Then I got a message that I wasn’t qualified for a refund. I reached out on the app chat and said to please review it. The agent who responded said sorry multiple attempts have been made so they can’t refund me. If you go to a restaurant and have a meal and the waiter only brings 2 of the 8 items you ordered then you only pay for what you ordered. What type of fraud is going on here? Uber eats should have their service license revoked in Puerto Rico.",1,App Store,UberEats
2024-05-06 14:44:57,"I really wish I would have read the reviews before downloading the app. The five stars are actually one star and from my experience, accurate. Avoid this app at all costs.

There is an “auto-confirm” feature during the checkout process that doesn’t allow enough time to actually check your order - which means you will place the wrong order at the wrong location and even if you cancel immediately and call the restaurant and confirm with them, support is unable to reverse the charges. I canceled my order and got the cancel confirmation but turns out just because the order was canceled doesn’t mean you get a refund. That was a $200 lesson and an app uninstall from me. They’ll say they can within 48 hours but that doesn’t even allow a credit card “pending” status to resolve.",5,App Store,UberEats
2024-05-10 19:46:03,"We placed an order for 3 items for breakfast at 10am, order showed up missing one item at 11am, called Uber and the establishment, and all we where told is they could refund the item, and we would have to repurchase, so after spending 2 hours on the phone with Ubers what they call “customer service” and even getting their “supervisor” to call us back, all the food is now cold, people still hungry, and a $12 waffle on first order with $16 in fees, gets refunded, and then we have to repurchase it for $25, and all Uber will do is give the $16 credit for the item. We were not asking for millions, we simply wanted what we ordered, with out being charged more for the item, and basically told they are only going to still only refund the $16 because the order was not late or missing, when the order was missing, had to be reordered so it was late, because they would not order it for us. And that they are ok with us writing reviews, and never ordering from Uber eats again so that they can save their $9.",1,App Store,UberEats
2024-05-11 15:29:08,"Uber eats i asked for help with my order right after my order was delivered because i found hair in my food my family had to find something else to eat and I contacted them and they wouldn't do anything to help that day so i disputed the charges for it once my bank refused the funds from them they say now that i need to
Figure out how to pay it back with a different payment method i will not be paying it because i don't agree to it i contacted customer service and they are now saying it's been over 48 hours so they will not help fix the issue on the app and they will not do anything for it so it will sit there and i will be using other apps to deliver goods to my house i am disabled so this is very frustrating that they will not do anything i hope others
Will be able to see to help them in a event like this if someone disputes a charge they are not going to pay it even if it requires to use this service again customer support is not helpful just keep on saying is past 48'hours which I contacted 3 hours after my order and no one wanted to help",1,App Store,UberEats
2024-05-12 00:21:53,"Please don’t buy from Papa John in Gunston plaza on Richmond hwy, I went there for wings I asked for all flats , I was told it had to be half and half I got home and they were more legs, I called and spoke to the manager who was nasty from the start , he said his name was Tony, after talking to him that Friday night May 3rd 2024, he said oh ok we dropped the ball you can bring them back, I said I will be bringing them back tomorrow he said oh ok, my general manager will be there he will take care of you, when I got there Tony was there, he was so nasty again I will take them back but you want get a refund, in fact get out my store I asked for the general manager he told me he said was the general manager and get out he said who bring chicken back anyway. I owned the store and if you don’t leave I’m calling the police, I tried waiting for the police for 30 minutes or more. I am a 67 year old black woman only there to settle the issue we had the night before, I wrote corp. no response, I call in a complaint that night I was told I will get a response and in 48 hours, still no response. Its no reason a customer should have been treated the way I was treated. I wouldn’t excise any one to go their with such customer service.",1,App Store,UberEats
2024-05-12 16:49:00,"I live in an area where there isn’t the infrastructure to support bicycle delivery. Generally, I pay for priority delivery and it’s not fair for that to be the case for bicycle delivery when it takes three times as long as by car. I live 15 mins by car from the establishment I ordered from but it took the cyclist 45-50 mins to PICK UP my order then an additional 45 mins to make it my house and my food had bumped with every bump they hit. I reached out to Uber eats about this and they claimed it was within the window and were apathetic. I didn’t complain the first time this happened but this is the second. There should be an option to refuse bike delivery. They should not charge you for priority delivery when it took three times as long as if someone had gotten it by car, nullifying the purpose. This is a horrible business model and it’s not like the delivery person gets extra compensation for it being priority- they do. I want a refund. I want an option to refuse bikes. I’m done with this company for the foreseeable future.",3,App Store,UberEats
2024-05-12 23:02:36,"I received my food an hour late, and that was after paying for rush delivery.  When we ordered, it said an hour max for delivery on their app.  The food took two hours to get delivered, and they just updated their delivery time and called it good.  Three customer service reps terminated the chat after giving me canned responses after I wanted to know why they could just move the goalposts and still charge me for rush delivery.  After the order was delivered, the app’s menu tree would not even allow me to reach another human.  It’s clear they don’t care about customers, which is sad, since they have some great restaurants on the app.  For those restaurants we had sucked up several bad experiences with UberEats, but it’s just not worth putting up with their absolute indifference to the problems they caused by breaking their commitments.  This ruined our Mothers Day dinner.  I think we’re done hoping that UberEats will get better, and back to any other food delivery app.",1,App Store,UberEats
2024-05-13 01:45:38,"Giving 5 stars so it’s closer to the top. The restaurant accepted my order , without checking to see if they had gf product. I was told they could not make the product (milkshake) in any flavor. I just had oral surgery so I couldn’t have anything else from the restaurant. The order was canceled. Uber tried charging me $6.21 for a shake I couldn’t get, not even one I didn’t want, but one the restaurant was unable to provide for me. How does that make sense? They told me I needed to make sure the order was accurate before placing it next time. It was accurate. I ordered exactly what I wanted. The lady did on Uber did not want to help me. It was only after I got incredibly angry did she escalate it and finally get me a “one time” refund. It is a really sick and twisted policy that you think it’s ok to charge people for a service that they didn’t cancel voluntarily, but because the restaurant is unable to provide the product. I will not be using this platform in the future, it is much easier to get refunds for situations like this via DoorDash.",5,App Store,UberEats
2024-05-15 04:05:03,"Was in a different location and they didn’t update address location like DoorDash does and informs you when you are far away. I ordered 4 pizzas totaling 65$ dollars, recognized location pick up address was wrong and tried to correct or cancel order with in 5 min and the app didn’t allow me. Contacted customer support and told me they had no access to the locations number and couldn’t process cancellation. I told them I wanted to cancel order, they did and charged me full amount for the order. I got back home near the original pizza franchise place and they never made the pizzas and kept my money. Uber didn’t help me and the place kept my money and didn’t even make the pizzas. Horrible app, they lost a loyal customer for life. 65 dollars saved for life, I will now use the official apps to the restaurants for pick ups. Half the time I order food for delivery it’s never correct, Uber truly isn’t innovating anything in the delivery industry. They are bad. Stray away",1,App Store,UberEats
2024-05-19 02:17:02,"They have no support in place for a driver who delivers to the wrong place. I recently placed an order that was delivered to one of the other 100 units in my neighborhood. The photo showed a different home than mine, yet Uber refused to redeliver or refund my order because their tracking system said it was delivered. I was unable to contact the driver because he didn’t have his voicemail set up properly. I was then told by the support person that it’s my responsibility to ensure my food is delivered properly. This is ridiculous, I gave the correct address and instructions for delivery, Uber Eats needs to take responsibility for their mistakes. Had I been able to contact the driver, I could have tracked down where my food was left. 

All of these issues still led to me paying for an order I never received. When I asked to speak to a supervisor I got a call late at night with a voicemail that gave me no option to call them back. I do not recommend using this app if you expect to receive the service and items you paid for. Will be contacting my bank to report them.",1,App Store,UberEats
2024-05-21 00:37:46,"I placed an order for pickup at a restaurant, and they took close to an hour for my order to be ready. Which was more then the estimated time upon placing the order. I contacted support and they refused to give me my money back, eventhough my order was never started on, and the fact that I had to leave to go to work. That’s not okay for them to steal my money.

You cannot speak to a live person, they over charge your account, and lack empathy for their wrong doings! They will end the chat when they want too without helping you. Some of the CSR’s are extremely rude. They will not offer you a resolution, even if they are wrong. Definitely don’t recommend if you want to avoid a stressful situation.",5,App Store,UberEats
2024-05-23 08:45:27,"I’ve been an Uber one member for the longest time. Now all of a sudden you can’t get a refund on missing items. They want you to take a picture. Of what?! Air? The item is missing. “We’ve determined the delivery matched the order”. How? When the drivers can’t even check in the bags because everything is sealed for delivery. I order a chipotle salad, there was no lettuce. The rep is going to tell me “we’ve determined the delivery matched the order”. How?! When there’s no lettuce in the picture I sent you. Restaurants keep screwing up and Uber eats is making the customers pay for the mistakes. I’m going to have to stop using this app. It’s not worth it anymore.

I didn’t want a refund. There was still food. I ate it. I wanted to report that it wasn’t the right food. Restaurants are increasingly messing up orders by leaving things out or giving the wrong items and customers are having to  forfeit a refund because it does not “follow the community guidelines”. In what community is it okay to slight your customers for your own benefit?? Uber already marks up the prices on items and then charges fees (even with Uber one) and now we can’t even get refunds on incorrect orders. All about the money I guess.",2,App Store,UberEats
2024-05-23 15:52:44,"I ordered from CVS. My order was incomplete. The driver did not follow my request for deliveries. The driver did not call upon arrival and left my bag on the porch did not knock or anything. I just happen to look out the window and seen a car park on the do not park side in front of my house as the passenger walked back to the car. I ordered Half gallon of whole Milk, StarBucks Pike Coffee, 2 Febreze air freshener holders, 4 Talenti ice cream. 
I didn’t receive a phone call or a text or a email that these items were not available as I received 2 Ben and Jerry ice cream of flavors that I do not eat. 

Please resolve this situation the tipper should not be tipped all the way because the person who went and got my stuff did not pick up what I asked for and did not communicate with me. Failed to communicate anything with me did not follow any of the rules.",5,App Store,UberEats
2024-05-24 23:48:12,"I’m probably giving this too harsh of a review because I’m mad, but today I got Uber eats from two different places (this is in Spain) but they were both in this mall. The Uber driver made it to our place earlier than the Uber eats app said they would, he only waited about five minutes, and when he called, I answered and I messaged him. My boyfriend then went down right away soon as I figured out he was waiting, which, as I said earlier was probably only five minutes, and then my boyfriend catches the Uber driver with our food and asks if it’s for him and the Uber driver just looks at him and says oh no and takes our food. He even took a picture of it and left a note saying he was leaving it at the door, but then did not and took all the food. I then contacted Uber to try and get a refund and I explained the whole situation and the amount of time and they still said we can’t do anything and you won’t get any refund. I just feel like that outcome is not fair because I did spend a lot of money on that food and I was in contact with the driver and he didn’t even wait that long. The food also came earlier than stated. This has not been the only problem, sometimes the food takes an outrageous amount of time to come even though it says it will be pretty quick, there are always missing or wrong items, and it is never easy to contact Uber. Will not be using this app thanks for stealing my money",1,App Store,UberEats
2024-05-28 06:20:48,"You have about a 10-20% chance to have your order stolen by a delivery driver, and the clever ones just cancel your order after they take it from the restaurant so you can’t even rate them poorly or get any recourse. The customer service will let you wait for an hour or more before telling you they can finally cancel a stolen order, and at best you’ll get a refund, but not always. They’ve had many other issues related to deliveries and customer service has only ever been even remotely helpful with any issue one time. Most often they will make you repeat yourself many times with questions already asked, then make you wait for as long as thirty minutes or more, then just tell you they won’t do anything to help and call it a day. This app’s customer service sincerely appears to be in place only to annoy you until you’re exhausted and no longer willing to complain, so you will accept paying money on an order that never arrived, or paying for missing items, or items ruined/spilled by deliverers, or paying for priority delivery and not getting it, etc.",1,App Store,UberEats
2024-05-28 23:52:05,"If I could give no stars, I would. Very disappointed in the treatment from the customer service on Uber eats. I had to go to the hospital ( needed stitches) right after I placed my order. They would not cancel my order. I paid for the order, they didn’t refund and no one was there to get the food. Then when I had my daughter reach out to them there simple response was “ I thought you needed to go to the hospital” they didn’t ask if I was even okay. They didn’t care at all. They ended up giving me a $1.38 credit.  Which was just insulting at that point. I have picture proof and everything. Shows a lot about the people who run and operate Uber eats. NEVER USING UBER EATS AGAIN! Sticking with door dash !",5,App Store,UberEats
2024-05-29 00:34:14,"I know everybody’s wondering why would I give Uber Eats one star first things first I accidentally signed up for the subscription membership and could not cancel down below. It said I have to pay $98 after the free trial and I was confused because I accidentally pressed it because uber eats has to many pop-ups just to order some food then after that, I tried to order some food and they would not let me cancel so I’m confused and I tried contacting the front office, but nobody answered. I emailed too still no answer. at this point they were  just ignore me I will not be paying that fee I don’t care what it takes. I will go to court for this how you gonna give somebody a membership and won’t let them cancel it Another thing is the taxes there’s no way I order a $10 meal and the tax is 6$ it comes up to $18 the math is not adding up at all uber eats is just broken and  will always be broken. It’s been like this since the first time it came out I always had trouble canceling my orders cause they wouldn’t let me so I have to go through it. I don’t know if this happens to other people or just me, but I consider this as scamming because you’re taking money from people without giving information about it I will not use Uber Eats again if this happens you i recommend switching to DoorDash!!!!",1,App Store,UberEats
2024-05-29 11:56:57,"I used uber eats because I heard it was better than doordash, but I don’t know about that. With DoorDash they pick restaurants that are close to you automatically. I’m at work, so I decided to order something, and when I went to order, it told me, “it seems like you are far from this location.” Something along those lines. I noticed that I had my home address, so I changed it to work and ordered. When they notify me that the order is being picked up, I check the map, and they are delivering from the restaurant close to my house!!! So the food is going to take an hour to get here! Why would they allow such a far delivery? Why the driver accepted such a far delivery is beyond me. We are in rush hour traffic… I’m so mad. They need to do better with their suggestions according to location, and/or maybe warn when you are ordering above a certain distance.",3,App Store,UberEats
2024-05-29 23:46:31,"Food delivered cold more often than not, the restaurant frequently gets your order wrong and then Uber refuses to refund you even when the food doesn’t show up, because they’ve screwed up so many times that they flag your account to receive no refunds. The taxes and fees are so exorbitant none of their “deals” are actually deals at all. Whatever discount they offer is set so you have to add a large enough number of items to your cart so that the increased price for the menu items and the exorbitant convenience fees eat up the entire discount and then some, so you end up paying $50 for $20 of food that gets delivered cold. There’s zero reason to use Uber Eats at all, total waste of time and money. And don’t believe a single thing the worst customer service team on earth and the most tactless developer’s response team tells you- they are never working to improve anything for you.

I had to deal with a frustrating automated chat and then an agent who offered a small discount for more waiting, which I accepted. However, the delivery person remained uncontactable by both me and the agent. After expressing my frustration and asking for a solution, the chat was ended, and the delivery still didn't progress. When I contacted support again, I received the same unhelpful response and was offered an inadequate discount despite my premium membership and the increased frustration. A 20% discount on an undelivered order in two hours, wasted were starving talking to two agents who are very inefficient for more than 40 minutes is insufficient. Considering the poor behavior of the delivery person and support agents, I will not renew my premium membership if nothing is done. This situation does not reflect the loyalty I have demonstrated to this app, and it has been extremely disappointing. I canceled my Uber one. I understand a delivery person going missing in action, but having two unprofessional, inefficient support agent that both and the chat promptly without my consent, and without solving the issue was too much.",1,App Store,UberEats

It’s a common theme as I’ve traveled throughout Southeast Asia and I’ve been to 12 countries. Grab continuously has terrible customer service, including no availability to cancel an order that’s existing an hour past It’s promised delivery time. Additionally, there’s no way to dispute a charge on a delivery because the Grab drivers can charge you whatever they want and then it’s between the grab driver and you and you have no way to dispute it! Meaning, I was promised a certain charge yet the crab driver can sita the promised charge between you and Grab and charge you 3 to 20 times more even if you didn’t agree to it. Don’t fall for the scam of this company. I’ve never met a worst ride hailing app then Grab and I’ve traveled 196 countries in the world.

You can vent to the bot, they don’t have a phone number to call, you can email and wait 7-10 business days for them to respond with a question you answered in the email. 

I made the mistake of ordering groceries, because they gave me a 40% discount. I got the recommended items and they ended up only having 4 out of 11 items, when the shopper asked me what I wanted to get instead of the 7 items I asked them to cancel the order. The shopper said he cannot, I contact support they said they can’t. And yes I contacted them while the driver was shopping I was stuck with 2 of my 11 items paying more for the fees than the food.

Majority of the time, my deliveries would have items missing, would be cold, or would be an entirely different order. I understand that’s sometimes a restaurant or driver issue, but when I take issues to customer service, they seem like they’ll do anything in their power to keep as much of your money as possible. My final straw was being charged the full amount for an accidental order I cancelled immediately. As soon as the confirmation screen popped up I cancelled, but I was still charged the full amount because the restaurant had “already begun preparing the order.” I don’t understand how they possibly could have done so within literal seconds, but go off I guess.

I saw that my order was totaled at $9.89. I selected no tips. And went to check out confirmed $9.89. I ordered the same exact order, saw the same thing at check out. However I was billed $11 the first time and $13 the second time. It was the same exact order with the same exact promotion. Sent a message to the agents, just requesting an explanation. No one would explain. They all just typed the promotion was attached and they answered my question. Which they didn’t because I still don’t see how it is I was changed more than what I saw when I click check out. And I selected no tips, because one of my order was hella late. 

The agents, Deepak, just ended the chat abruptly, being very rude, because I still wasn’t sure of what was going on. The agents are not nice and the app is selecting what it chooses and billing people incorrectly ( different price from check out amount).",1,App Store,UberEats

Yes, I got a ""full refund"" this time around since I got absolutely nothing and I understand the driver needs to keep the tip which doesn’t get refunded to me, but I think the company should take that cost as well. I literally just paid for nothing to get delivered (once again).  Basically just paid somebody to drive to the wrong location, while I get no food on top of that.  
Not once have I ever gotten my food delivered somewhere else by any other restaurant or app besides strictly Uber Eats. It is such an easy address too, literally four numbers and the name of the street. It is really not that complicated (no apt no., etc).

BUT!!!! Within the last year in particular, it feels like Uber Eats has been taking advantage of the fact that you kinda *need* notifications turned on your phone in order to know when your food is here, so they can shove ads in your face. It’s already bad enough that you can’t watch videos or scroll social media without seeing add every 5-60 seconds; why must my phone notifications be ads too? Wasn’t this corporation already generating enough money already *before* making all these ads for fast food chains? It just feels greedy, unnecessary, and inconvenient.

When I went into the chat section, the representative told me they couldn't change it on their end either and that I could message the driver and let them know of the change and maybe the driver will help. It didn't work, and the driver didn't respond to any of my messages or answer the phone when I called twice.

I asked them if they could just give me. 2.00$ and that would solve the problem and I could order and after that I guess I went to far in our discussion bc the immediately ended chat.

2024-06-17 03:28:33,"I noticed tonight that I was charged an odd amount for a Uber order that was delivered wrong- the delivery driver didn’t bring a drink I paid over $6 for. 

As a prerequisite, I set my tip to $0 when I order just to be sure I’m not tipping if they are a bad driver (I’ve had plenty- my instructions say not to ring the doorbell and I’ve had drivers not only ring it but refuse to leave it at the door, ask me to come to their car, etc). Once it’s delivered I change the tip to be adequate to how their service was, but I ALWAYS tip. 

Well tonight after the driver didn’t bring half my order, I tipped them $4. Only for two hours later for my card to be charged for $8, which I know I didn’t agree to seeing as you have to manually type in the tip if you go to change it. 
So I went to Uber to dispute this, their only customer service is a chat or email. The only option I had for changing the tip was the instructions for changing it as usual, but they only allow you a hour to do so. Seeing as I was charged two hours later- I cannot change it and Uber stole money from me, and is giving me no option but to just let it happen or go dispute a $8 charge with my bank. 

Check your total directly after the order is delivered, make sure you aren’t being charged for anything you didn’t agree to. Thankfully mine was just a tip, which goes to the driver.",2,App Store,UberEats

My most recent order was literally just sushi and it took AN HOUR AND A HALF to arrive. I have tried speaking to customer service about this and they are unhelpful and useless, they just say things along the lines of “well your order arrived, sorry it took longer than advertised”. I cancelled my Uber One today  after speaking with Manpreet, as I ordered a coffee and it once again said 30-45 minutes and took over an hour to get to my house and when I asked why this keeps happening, she ignored my question and said to contact customer service if my order doesn’t arrive because I don’t “have any problems yet” .

Some times you will have the occasional canceled order and that’s not good but 99% of the time you’re food shows up and you get your grub in time to watch your favorite movie and cuddle up with the family. There are definitely more times than I like the driver does not check the order and items are missing or wrong but Uber Eats tries to reimburse you the best they can and that’s all you can expect from a company.

So I received 21 dollars in credit Then an hour later 5 dollars disappears from my credit (Uber Cash) it goes down to 16 dollars and it list an extra 5 dollars being taken out for the tip even though the driver received a prior tip and I never altered anything. Then the last straw hits when I wanted to order some sushi with my credit. The order was 29 dollars minus the 16 that was there I should have only spent 13ish dollars out of my bank account TELL ME WHY IT DIDNT USE MY UBER CASH IN THE TIP 18 CAME OUT FROM MY ACCOUNT. Why would they take the tip out of my credit two times AND then make me pay 5 out of pocket with the tip on the next order!!! That’s sooooo wrong I only received 10 dollars covered by credit when it was supposed 21.

Dealing with customer service trying to correct issues with orders is the problem. We would order 4+ times a week so obviously not everything is always correct. The first few times needing assistance was fine. Fast forward and they will flag your account for reporting problems. We spent over $100 one evening on dinner. Did not receive an entire entree priced around $30. Contacted customer to fix the issue and they said there was nothing they could do and my account was flagged and no refunds or coupons would ever be received again due to too many reports. When you’re ordering 20+ times a month OF COURSE things are going to be incorrect or missed occasionally. And of course I’m going to contact customer service because that’s my hard earned money but apparently there’s a limit with UberEats on how much they think should be corrected for you! So order away but just know eventually you’ll be paying them for incorrect and missed orders.",5,App Store,UberEats

There was a time my order was stolen by the driver and they refused to give me a refund even though I had placed the order again. Even if you place an order by mistake and manage to cancel it within 30 seconds, they still take half of what the order was for “fees” even though there is no assigned driver and the restaurant never made the order. I’d recommend using doordash because they provide way better help for any issue you would have and they don’t just give you automated replies behind human names to make you feel like you aren’t talking to a bot. They all provide around the same inflated prices, so you’re really only using the app for the support, features and promotions.

When I apply them to my order they never work. I’ve called them about this issue and they just tell me the promotions got deactivated, even tho I received them that day. When asked why they got disabled they have no actual answer and keep repeated that Uber reserves the right to do so whenever they’d like. When I asked if there was a supervisor I could speak to about this issue since she was unable to help me and this isn’t the only promotion that hasn’t worked she instantly hung up the phone. I used to love the app and used it all the time especially during Covid, but now it’s a scam and I will never use Uber eats again and advise you to not use it either.

But instead, we are sent to chat to someone in another country with poor customer service. They ignore you and clearly are just trying to get rid of you.

I have had several drivers sit in one place for an hour and then deliver my order, and there is no repercussion for the driver. Once they pick up the order you can’t change the address or anything else they say you can do then tell you they will charge you to cancel the order that you know is messed up because of them.

It’s like some mad genius optimized an app for taking good people that work hard to deliver good food that people worked hard to cook to people who work hard for the money to pay for it. Everyone’s incentives are aligned to make this works. Then comes the Uber effect. The most stupidest decision is always selected. I just ordered from Jack’s Urban Eats, a local chain favorite that has a storefront a mile or two away. When I check on the order, the driver picked it up, then drove 20 minutes in the opposite direction to make another deliver then drive 22 minutes to pass the same Jack’s and 1 minute to deliver the now 45 minutes old sandwiches and urban fries.  Stupid. The same restaurant, another story, they sent the order to a store 2 town over and waived the services fee so it looked legit. 
They have this deal add a 2nd stop for your driver for no service fee. If you set it up so the 2nd place (like dessert or boba drinks etc) is on the way from the first place to make it easy they inevitably send 1 person to the the drinks or desserts spot immediately and later dispatch a different person to get your dinner order 20-40 minutes later",1,App Store,UberEats

It’s annoying though it’s only happened once to me, it was quite annoying because I don’t order food quite often. So it was pretty frustrating to deal with. I hope Uber has improved this and I’m not sure who’s fault it was on their end whether the restaurant or the delivery driver just hoping this can improve. Another complaint is sometimes the prices can be outrageous, like for a small slurpee with tax and delivery fee is $7? I might as walk but I guess. I don’t think they can do much about prices but I’m glad it’s not to bad. It’s just a little higher than preferably acceptable. Other than these 2 things.

When I asked, they tried to falsely claim that I was being fraudulent and yet, had no evidence of such a claim when I asked.

After emailing 2 more times that I want a refund they said they’ll give me $10 credit for Uber eats. I tried to order something and apply the credi  it and it didn’t work. I emailed them back and instead of answering my questions they just said we can’t refund you. The lack of customer service and the fact that they don’t value or appriciate their customers AT ALL!!!!!! Is honestly pathetic.
( I order form Uber eats all the tome sometimes as much as 5 days per week). I decided to try Uber eats again after not using it for a while but after this recent experience I’m not using them EVER again and will most definitely not recommend to anyone to use it. I will be using DoorDash instead as my experience is a lot more pleasant with them.",2,App Store,UberEats
2024-07-12 16:02:24,"We ordered from Uber Eat App for food delivery , and our order was delivered but missing two out of four main courses. The receipt on the bag listed our order correctly, but was not including in the bag. We have tried to reach out to Uber Eat through the App, but was not properly refunded for the missing items. After several attempts to get to the correct refunds, the only respond was: “You’ve exceeded your support attempts”, and that was it. No number to contact customer service and no chat available. Our food was still missing, but we can not get help, nor a proper refund. We tried to contact the restaurant, there was only pre recording and not able to speak with a real person. Tried the restaurant app, it mentioned the deliver through third party (aka Uber Eat) has to contact the third party. We’ve learned our lesson.

Update:
Received feed back from support team a day later. The support team had provided refund for what is just for our missing delivery items plus some extra for the next order. I considered it was fair compensation for what we had went through.  Only hope Uber Eat will bring back the chat options for anything that goes wrong with orders. Either way, we will continue use the app for our convenience.",4,App Store,UberEats

I have use the Uber app to order a car for my friends for my children now and then. But never food, so I placed the order saw that it was picked up and the driver was going to be here in 15 minutes then I got a notification that the driver had to make another stop on the way and it was 10 minutes after the original time they were supposed to be here when the lady when the female showed up and it was supposed to be a male driving a car I said to her is it normal that Uber food delivery people make another stop in between the delivery she just gave me a blank look and the way you are not the male that’s in the picture she got back in her car. I lowered the tip to 10% and I was going to give 22% told her that I was going to report her and she said I was rude. I’ll figure out how to use the rest of my money or just let it go to waste.

This time a driver just straight up didn’t deliver my food, marked as delivered, then declined my calls through the app. There was no contact with the driver. Trying to get help on the app tells you to contact driver. Took over 10 minutes after the incident to actually get to at least chat with someone. And they’re agents are very polite, but have NO IDEA about actual customer service. I outlined my problem with the steps I had already taken, and was told to do the same steps I had already outlined I had done. They would then refuse to let me speak to a supervisor. Took 3 different agents to get a confirmation that at the very minimum I get a complete refund to my method of payment. There idea of a resolution was originally refunding the money for the food I never received, and that’s it. No offer of redelivery, not even refund of the fees and tips, let alone compensation or an attempt to make it right.

I ordered 6 items. The delivery driver changed the quality of 2 items which cost me more. He then said they didn’t have any Rose in the entire grocery store and no cake. This is obviously an outright lie. He didn’t speak any English but I shouldn’t suffer for the lack of ability to communication. To add insult to injury, he charged me for 4 items and only brought the 2 that he upped the quantities of. After leaving off the wine, he still insisted that I show an ID for alcohol and sign for it. I simply signed, “no wine” since I didn’t receive any. There’s no number to call for Uber Eats and the Help option is extremely limited to preselected options like missing item or it would just direct you to self service with no help at all. I hope to be refunded for my missing items but the entire experience was for convenience. This order took an hour of my time and wasted my money, then I still had to go out get dinner.

In the last 6 months I have had an issue with them not honoring their own benefit policy with my cc . I have reached for the last 3 months trying to solve the issue. Well first there is no number to call directly so I attempted to go through the app and they waited over three days to respond and when they did they gave instructions that deleted the app and the entire conversation. Secondly to locate any type of help through the app took over an hour to begin a chat because non of the help options lead to a representative. The app is horrible especially since they have the Uber and uber eats separated. You are the same company why would you not just combine into one . It because they have no consistory their guest / customers. They are only in the business of taking money and not giving service. They state that they are always doing upgrades and making sure the app is functioning but in reality it’s all false.,1,App Store,UberEats

They can’t help you with anything, I had a $20 off promotion for any order over $25 and it applied to my order but when I went to go check out, it says the coupon can’t be applied when I reached out to customer support they said the coupon should work for my order, but since it’s not they gave the trash idea to purchase the meal full price anyway and after my food got delivered, they’ll apply the promo after when I asked for details as to how that worked, they couldn’t give me any details and ended the chat abruptly they said that a lot of people were having issues with applying the promo and it’s a bug inside of the app. Uber Eats has to be the worst thing created for food delivery ever, and I hope the entire company burns to the ground. hungry people have the worst attitudes so considering that this app is so trashy I don’t know why they won’t put the work in to fix it.

That is how i ended up with three pizzas the other day and spent $70 as opposed to the $20 something dollars I intended to spend. Second complaint has more to do with the uber one membership rathe than the app. Users paying a premium for a membership should get delivery priority but right now drivers can pick up multiple orders to deliver… so you maybe waiting forever to get your order. BUT for an extra fee… on top of your membership premium, you can pay an extra fee to have your order delivered first. Uber with the ten million fees for the win. Next, you’ll most likely NOT receive your order more often than receive it. If the driver delivers your order to the wrong house, Uber will issue a refund for the food and fees BUT THE TIP WILL STILL GO TO THE DRIVER. Thanks for hijacking my tip and rewarding the driver for their incompetence. I personally do not like to tip
if my order never gets to me.  More and more often the driver in the picture is not the one that shows up… so much for safety.  Lastly, more often than not drivers do not speak english so good luck trying to resolve something with them if there is an issue with your delivery.",1,App Store,UberEats

I was in the same help chat for the order for three days and got the same response from the “person” taking my ticket and I’m writing this review mainly because under the different names of “people” sending me responses send messages not too distinctly from how a ChatGPT Ai with a prompt that most likely tells it something like “write a message to a customer that informs them there order is not eligible for a refund”  because I am getting a very similar message repeatedly with the same core meaning, something ChatGPT Ai bots do.

I will be deleting the app moving forward and spending my money elsewhere, I’m only 1 guy ordering and it won’t make a big deal, I’m aware . However, with the customer service being so rude when an issue occurs and ignoring simple questions on why I’m waiting 2.5 hours for food after they assured me at the 1.5 hour mark it will arrive within the time window ( 10 minutes after the convo )and it just continued past it , again, and again. They shouldn’t make guarantee’s when it’s out of their control. It was 5p on a Friday evening so I’m sure that’s a busy time but no one was picking up the order and customer service just kept lying saying someone had was on the way so I couldn’t cancel it .

Restaurants do not tell you when items are out of stock, and ur left with making 1-2 hour call to Uber and they can’t do anything about it and you have to settle for something you didn’t want.  This has happened with every ice cream store we have ordered in Uber eats. 
 Along with restaurants saying their open and when you place your order they close the restaurant and you again have to call customer service and ask for a refund or cancel and in reality it takes so long. Restaurants forget certain items and you have to experience the frustration every single time you order.  Some Uber drivers cancels your order. My family has have to wait 2 hours once to wait for a driver and  also the 20-30 minutes to the drive to drop off the order. I recommend DoorDash as it’s better then Uber.

Their customer service uses a script and will not treat you like a human, and will just pass you along to another representative who will copy and paste the same script. They do not want to help you find a solution for your issue. If you look on Reddit, you’ll find countless stories of customers who have had this happen to them. I genuinely don’t understand how there hasn’t been a class action suit or some kind of investigation with Uber Eats, because this business practice genuinely seems unethical to me, and a scam for customers.

Salmon can be delivered BAD - smelling and tasting foul. Restaurants can put mustard on your food when you ask them not to. Heck, you can even declare a allergy to an ingredient, ask they 86 it, and they can ignore it with no recourse. In fact, none of these issues get justice From Uber eats. They put the cost and the blame on the customer. About a thousand dollars I’ve spent on Uber eats this year and raw salmon which I ordered medium was the last straw. While I’ll be filing a charge back through my bank for the raw salmon I received and couldn’t eat - I now know that Uber eats doesn’t care about the customer at all. It’s more concerned with keeping restaurants happy (ie; no refunds). They don’t take responsibility when multiple issues happen too close together on a timeline - they don’t take in account how often a user uses the app in relation to the amount of issues they report.

Normally if there is an issue with the order I submit an help report and get a refund. That has changed last couple of months. Unfortunately there are 2 restaurants that have been not providing all the items or wrong items repeatedly. I submitted pics of wrong items and was told my order was right and no refund would be given despite the picture showing otherwise. I go back and forth and now they claim I am violating refund policy. Not sure how when I pay for items that don’t arrive. It seems Uber is violating their own policy. 
I am starting to just grab food myself now because their support has really declined and try claiming I am abusing refund policy for asking for refund for missing/wrong items, even when pics are provided.

Understandable that mistakes are made, and things happen, however, when reaching out to customer service to try to resolve the issue, I was met with a slew of chat bots that were entirely unhelpful, and even ended the chats abruptly with no resolution. There is no human customer service rep that you can contact or phone number that you could reach out to. All responses are extremely automated and not at all customize to the situation at hand.

One representative even told me I should have called Uber Eats customer service instead of cancelling on the app and, if so, that should plainly be indicated as an option instead of cancelling directly on the app and having to eat exorbitant fees. I kept calling customer service and asking to speak with a supervisor who might be able to effectively resolve this but it's been an endless waiting game and it just feels like the customer representatives don't really care. It's ridiculous to lose money over cancelling right after an accidental transaction and before any food preparation has begun.

When getting dropped off with my daughter and car backed into your driver cause he didn’t park in space and almost ran my child over! I have been trying to reach y’all for months due to the amount I spend and it’s not easy to get in touch with yall. You can go back back through my rides and check every that has gone wrong with my rides and now today I order food and the order is completely wrong, not on y’all’s part but the restaurants but I spend too much money with yall everyday to not be recompensated some off it back.

2024-08-15 00:08:01,"I stopped using Uber several years ago because our delivery drivers couldn’t seem to get the full order to my house, and Uber NEVER refunds for missing items (they refund for incorrect items, but never missing items). We started using it again recently and had an order delivered missing over half the $60 order. I contacted Uber and asked for a refund of the missing items only, didn’t include tip or tax in the request……it was around $17. They said they would refund my whole order. Suppose, they did not. They refunded $7. I contacted support the next day and was told the first time that because the order was 48 hours ago, they couldn’t help me. The order was less than 24 hours ago…..then the second agent seemed friendly and happy to help, until they responded with “the system is experiencing difficulties” and abruptly ended the chat. The customer service here is nonexistent. And I paid for my kids food order then when they didn’t get it, I had to take them food and pay a second time for items I had already paid for!!! Cancel this service if you have it and use DoorDash or Grub Hub…..thier customer service is a million times easier to deal with.",1,App Store,UberEats
2024-08-15 02:51:23,"I used to love Uber eats, it was an easy way to get tons of different types of food. The reason I give it 3 stars is that in the past few years there has been so many deliveries where they say the food is delivered, there is no photo evidence of delivery, no door bell ring, nothing. Just “delivered” but the food never arrived. The app is good with refunding you but after this happening 5x in a row multiple times it’s like why??? How does this happen?? What if you’re waiting on Uber eats for dinner after 12 hours of working and you come home to a “delivered”
Dinner only to find out that nothing is there and your courier either stole the food or.. something else went wrong? It’s horrible. Contacting support is useless they tell you that the money is refunded and this event has been documented. But nothing has improved over the course of several years. This app has become so undependable it’s almost not worth using. I wish the app would fix this but they refuse to care.",3,App Store,UberEats

I never made an order to that place and would never order something on my birthday worth my own card. Then called and they said someone else may have ordered from my account I told them “take them out of my account or find the address” they responded “sorry I can’t do that” then I ask can I get my money back, I wanted it back bc it was over 50 dollars in a purchase (fraudulent purchase). Apparently they can’t give me money back so they keep texting me for five days I can’t see the transaction, but the day before she said the exact order total that was charged and it was in the texting history. So I thought this was a scam. I feel bad if this happens or did happen to anyone else other than that I liked this app I used it for like 1.5 years and nothing like this has happened. If this order was somehow over that amount of money or if this person who ordered wit my account and card got ahold of my info that would have been a bad situation for them.

2024-08-17 07:11:20,"We all know that order food delivered via Uber Eats mean you pay all kinds of extra fees. And we all know that the delivery drivers are “independent contractors” so that Uber does not have to take responsibility for them the way most businesses have to take responsibility for their employees. 

But I still expected them to take some responsibility when I live chatted with customer service about my delivery driver stealing my food. He had been 6 minutes away from my house, then I checked a few minutes later and he was 18 minutes away driving away from me on the interstate. And then shorty after that, he was half a county away and the eta was reading 31 minutes with him not responding to my messages. I told customer service that I understood that there was no chance I was getting my food that night, but  wanted to be able to leave a review of this guy so others could be forewarned, and I wanted some type of credit from Uber above simply allowing me to cancel the order at no cost to me. But customer service instead cancelled the order, then when I asked about the credit ( which they give as a matter of course if a meal is delivered late), they signed out of the chat. So I got no credit, and because it was a cancelled order, I was not able to leave a review of the driver.",1,App Store,UberEats

I got a notification from the driver that the food was delivered with a picture of the packages on his car seat. I was staying at a hotel to be someone at the front desk. I tried to contact the driver, but he never picked up the phone. I contacted Uber Eats to report the issue, and they answered that the driver tried to contact me by knocking on the door where I was staying, which was a lie. First, he would have to pass by the reception, where someone is always there. This is very disappointing since I waited for an hour without food or money.  My son was starving, so I had to order the food from the same restaurant again and wait another hour. So I used the restaurant driver this time, and I had no problem!!

I even provided evidence and everything like it’s not like I’m lying…… the customer service is just something else too like when you ask for a refund after so many they just don’t even send you a confirmation email anymore after asking for help like how I used to.

I have decided not to make it an issue or complain but today was my last straw. I ordered one single specific item from Burger King and that cost me so much money almost $30 and my order is taking two hours to get to me and Uber has switched out my drivers multiple times making an even longer wait for me , I’m awfully hungry and now dissatisfied for my food.

They instead closed the chat on my face and gave me Uber cash. I am DONE with this app. We should all just go to restaurants for pickup (and save money) instead of supporting this unethical tech giant.

I said maybe the app sent the message but the person has not yet arrived. I waited a few minutes and nothing. I called the delivery person no answer. I said this person stole my food. I then with frustration click the help tab and requested my money back not realizing the thing was set on Uber cash before pushing it. I then hurry up and call them only for them to keep trying to give me Uber cash. I told the person to put their supervisor on the phone and they said they will have to call me back.

2024-08-21 02:13:49,"I am writing this review to draw attention to two issues. One with the app is I received two promotions on my Uber one membership account, meaning I’m paying Uber to receive coupons and deals each month. I had a 40 percent and 50 percent coupon on my account that I could not add and use. It has stayed on my account for over 3 weeks and seems to be infinitely taking up space for working promo codes which I am again paying money for every month. I tried to ask why I could not use the coupons (the t&c do not say they are deactivated, excluded from my account, or have special conditions I need). I went through 4 service representatives who all very rude and short with me. I just wanted to make sure I could still receive working coupons (because again I am paying for exclusive deals and hadn’t received a working one in over a month). I was very dissatisfied with my experience. All I wanted to know was how can I remove these promos so I can start getting working ones again because these two had been sitting in the “rotational queue” potentially blocking future promotions until the app saw that these were used. I just wanted to have a confirmation or not to what was going and was treated poorly and I am unable to utilize my membership because of a glitch/Uber eats problem which I tried restarting, logging in/out, and all the other fixes but received no real help after months of loyalty I changed my rating for this mess of an app!",1,App Store,UberEats

I’ve used uber eats many many times but apparently you can only “rate your order” negatively 3 times and uber will credit you for a bad order received. After that, if the restaurant screws up your food, it’s automatically your fault and uber will not do anything about it. In fact, they will tell you that you’re not allowed to complain more than three times about bad food. I spoke with three reps and got disrespected in the worst way. I ordered my lunch at work at 2:00pm and no driver was assigned to it until an hour later. The time kept changing for when I’d get my order. The reps I spoke to said they’d fix the issue if the order came later than 3:40. The time changed again and it was after 3:40….i leave work at 3:30. I notified them of this. They said if I cancel I have to pay for it. And that they were kidding and couldn’t help me anymore when my order came after 3:30 AFTER they promised to fix the issue which they didn’t fix.

Uber Eats took my money for an order that was never delivered, when I tried to file a complaint and request a refund considering the order wasn’t delivered. I I tried to contacted the delivery driver phone call sent straight to voicemail. I called the restaurant the order was coming from they told me they never processed the order, meaning they didn’t charge Uber eats for the order at all. So I tried to reach out to the customer support and all I was met with a “your order is not eligible for a refund” response 3 days later. So basically Uber took 70$ out my bank account, the restaurant never charged Uber Eats for my order so they never actually paid for the food, and I never had order delivered. So Uber Eats just took my 70$ and kept it, not paying the restaurant and not delivering my food. I even talked to customer support multiple times in chat logs and explained everything to a real person I was told “unfortunately your order isn’t eligible for a refund, we’re sorry”.

2024-08-25 18:52:57,"I have been a loyal Uber Eats user, often relying on the app for its convenience due to my busy lifestyle. However, my recent experiences have been nothing short of frustrating and disappointing. 

Firstly, the lack of customer service is alarming. I've encountered multiple issues, primarily with my food arriving cold. It seems that drivers often pick up orders only to drive further away to drop off other deliveries before bringing my food. This lack of accountability from Uber Eats is unacceptable.

Today, I had an even worse experience. After taking a bite of my meal, I discovered a hair in my mouth. I promptly took a picture of the hair on a napkin and sent it to customer service, expecting some acknowledgment or resolution. To my dismay, I was informed that since the hair wasn't directly in the food in the photo, they would not take any action. This response exemplifies how little they care about their customers.

After spending around $2,000 on this app this year, I can no longer justify using a service that shows such a blatant disregard for quality and customer satisfaction. I will be deleting the app and will be seeking alternative delivery services. I even hesitate to use Uber for travel services now, given this experience. 

I highly recommend looking for other options for food delivery—you'll likely find a better experience elsewhere.",1,App Store,UberEats

Not only did I have THREE of my items missing but also the wrong item substitution. When I realized later on in the day that I also didn’t receive my third item i quickly opened a chat just for them to tell me that they can’t refund me the item and feel free to leave a review….. why do you think you can’t physically get on the phone with someone? They know exactly what they doing.  I even sent them pictures as proof. This isn’t the first time they do this . It’s my fault I keep falling for it . You literally have to SHOP AT YOUR OWN RISK.

A week later I get a response after I reached out and I was told they can’t do any refunds after 48 hours. Uber has proof of me reaching out immediately when they screwed up double charging me. The support team is horrible. They are choosing to rectify the error, and messages are going unanswered. This lack of response is highly concerning and falls short of the standard of excellence they claim and what I expected from Uber.

This is not only false, but physically impossible. I had just created my account. There had been no time to place an order, let alone commit an act that violated the terms of service! So I pressed them to make sure it wasn't a system error. They instead sent the same statement again and refused to elaborate before cutting the chat feed.

They changed the amount after I paid for my order without my consent. You can tip as much as you prefer, but making a customer obligated to tip and charging them something they aren’t aware of is illegal. Their customer service has very limited access to help their customers with anything.

Separate incident, I have ordered on the app for a pickup order and the owner of the store decided to close the store before the time they had listed and I didn’t get my order. It was $35 worth of food and I immediately contacted the customer service. Similar to the other issue, they didn’t know how they could help me and told me to wait 24 hours, which made no sense. There was no refund and follow ups or resolution provided. What’s even the point of having a customer service team if they dismiss you at their slightest inconvenience?

Good service when it works but don’t add on light grocery shopping - 4 items $7 more in tip on top of $5. Live and learn. But wait there’s more. My meal delivery came an hour ago and still no groceries. Driver could find 3 out of 4 items including a pint of blueberries. Suggested subbing bacon for smoked salmon. That would not go well with the Hallal or Kosher set. I got an offer for $10 of food but with $12 in fees and tips what’s the point??

2024-08-28 01:26:56,"If you’re considering driving for Uber Eats, I strongly urge you to think twice before signing up. My recent experience highlighted a major issue that every potential driver should be aware of: Uber Eats allows customers to drastically change the tip amount after delivery, leaving drivers shortchanged and frustrated.

I accepted a delivery for $15, which included a tip, to drive 7 miles. After completing the order and delivering the food, I was shocked to find that the customer had reduced the tip to zero, leaving me with only a $3 base fare. This was a complete waste of my time, gas, and vehicle mileage. When I reached out to Uber Eats customer support, they informed me that customers have the right to change the tip amount after delivery, regardless of the effort the driver puts in.

This policy effectively allows customers to abuse the system, leaving drivers with little to no recourse. Uber Eats’ stance on this matter is highly disappointing, as it shows a lack of consideration for the drivers who are the backbone of their service. Before you decide to drive for Uber Eats, be aware that you could end up being severely underpaid for your work.",1,App Store,UberEats

I’ve had countless items be missing from my orders and whenever I go to get my money back they either close the case without giving me my money back or offer a small little 5 dollar Uber cash that isn’t even the equivalent of what I paid for and honestly doesn’t take much off the order. Even with my latest order I was missing a whole meal. I did what I was supposed to do and was expecting a refund cuz what I ordered cost at least 14 dollars. They hit me with the “someone will reach out to you within 48 hours” and when I did get a message it was just them saying that my food was all there and then closed the case! I had to order more food that night because I didn’t get my food. So to see that I’m not even getting refunded for that meal I never received gets me upset.

I tried my hardest to explain, but he kept saying “no no no no”. I called the school and they had people outside looking for him and there was no one there.

First time it was maybe a year ago when I was was charged the same amount of tip that i already had been charged for. This sudden charge appears after delivery is made. That time when I contacted customer service I was told by the agent that “sorry, but nothing can be done about this and you, the customer, simply lost that money, and you have to accept that”. Simply I was told that. Yesterday I ordered food after a year and, guess what, again the same situation. Of course, I did contact customer service. All the agent told me that this is a known issue, and that’s it. So if you don’t want to lose money each time due to known issue that nothing can be done about, what agent told me, and nothing has been done about for at least a year - then simply use another service which I’m using.

2024-08-30 15:42:52,"We have been loyal customers with Uber eats for a couple of years now but our latest experience has made us end our Uber one membership and delete this app.
We ordered pizza. Now with this order we got 1 pizza and got 1 free pizza, a 2 liter drink, 3 sauces, and cheese bread. After we got the notification that our order had been delivered, we open the door to only find the sauces and the cheesy bread.
We immediately contact support to tell them that we didn’t get our two pizzas and our 2 L drink. 
And of course they wanted proof that we didn’t get those items with a receipt and a picture of what we got. Upon further investigation on their side, they told us that we HAD received all of our items and they could NOT refund us for the items we had not gotten. So we called to speak to an actual person, and all they told us that they couldn’t help or refund us so they sent us to yet again another message group for support. We even asked multiple times why they couldn’t respond us and they couldn’t give us a straight answer. Low and behold, they said the exact same thing… They couldn’t refund us because we got everything. So again, we cancelled our membership and will not be using Uber anymore.",1,App Store,UberEats

2024-08-31 04:13:16,"I know that I shouldn’t use this app. They treat their workers badly, and they treat the restaurants they partner with badly. But I currently have Covid and needed groceries, and it seemed like this was the cheapest way to get them delivered because they had a promo for $40 off. But when I increased my tip because I thought the dude was really fast and did a good job with substitutions, they removed that promotion and refused to reapply it without a screen shot, which I would have had to take before putting the order in. It was totally ridiculous. It’s like, you’re a tech company, and you can’t make sense of this without me sending you a screenshot. Like, I’m pretty sure I’m talking to a chatbot right now, and it’s claiming not to have the technology to look up a receipt. And there is no way to talk to an actual person. It was so frustrating that I just gave up. Delivery should not be kafkaesque. It’s supposed to make things easier. I won’t be using this app in the future.

2024-09-03 03:24:36,I recently started paying for a Uber One membership because I thought I would try it out. You have to spend $10 extra a month for “exclusive benefits and discounts.” The FIRST promotion I used was a 50% off any grocery order. I was babysitting so I thought I would try it out and got groceries for dinner. The total was $58 with the 50% off promo when I confirmed it and after they were delivered I was charged $106. I contacted customer service and every representative I spoke with said they could do nothing about it because I had no proof. I looked this up online and found that many others have experienced the same issue and have been blown off by customer service. I will be cancelling my subscription and using better services like GrubHub and DoorDash since I’ve never been taken advantage of by the other (and better) delivery services. I will no longer be supporting a company that TRICKS and CHEATS their customers into “deals” and then doubles the charge to your card and says “I’m sorry for the inconvenience but there is nothing we can do.” How unprofessional…,1,App Store,UberEats
2024-09-04 19:46:59,"App likes to upcharge ridiculously. Then will charge random absurd fees when they waive delivery fees because you have a monthly subscription. Then after paying monthly, having to meet a minimum order total, and being charged random fees, they will attempt to guilt you into a tip that is as high as half your total or more. Now I will not order if I can not adequately compensate my delivery driver but asking $10 on a $20 order to deliver it 3.2 miles and it only has a handful of light items is a bit egregious. My last order had a free item on it which they used to boost my order total so as to be able to charge more fees and higher tip. After paying for the subscription and spending enough to qualify( so meeting 2 requirements) they had the audacity to total out my order with 12 in fees being discounted but the taxes and tip based off a total with my promotional items cost tallied in. They will also estimate your delivery and it can change up to almost an hour. As well as if no driver will take your order but the store started to make it and you can no longer wait for your order you will be charged simply to cancel it. Literal cash sucking all around for anything they absolutely can. THE ONLY UPSIDE IS THE FRIENDLY DRIVERS.",1,App Store,UberEats

The customer service team was unprofessional and rude. My most recent incident involved ordering food from a restaurant for almost $100. After processing the payment, I realized that I had forgotten some items, so I used the ""forgot something"" option to add the additional $20 order. Despite both orders showing as being delivered by one courier, only the $20 order was delivered the $100 one was NEVER delivered. When I contacted customer support, they suggested that I go to the restaurant to pick up my missing order myself!!! Why would i pey for delivery?. After long hours on the phone and messaging, I received neither a refund nor the missing food. I felt cheated and, as a result, have decided to delete the app from my phone. I will no longer be using this service and also won't be using Uber again. My advice would be to stay away from these services. They STILL your money",1,App Store,UberEats

I immediately contacted the delivery driver to verify, and he said that he double checked and asked the restaurant if all the order ready, and the restaurant indicated that everything was ready to be picked up, however, when the order was delivered, only two items were delivered. Uber eats says sorry, but they cannot refund for those items that I am still paying for. What company does this? I tried to chat with them three or four times and finally they cut me off and refused to respond. I will have to dispute this with my credit card company, but Uber eats. You are a terrible company for trying to make me pay for items that I did not receive. Additionally, I also called the restaurant and they essentially said that it’s not their problem.

I always have problems with delivery apps. It’s part of the tradeoff. Someone is bringing your craving to your door, you have to accept it might be soggy or cold or missing this or that. I started on DoorDash and hit a point with them where it was too many mistakes too often and it never seemed like the restaurants or the app cared. I lasted a lot longer on Uber than DoorDash, but I am at that point. Maybe il go be a Grubhub guy for a while. 

My last order was overpriced as is but it was from a place I’ve been really excited about. I paid extra for more toppings and stuff too! They didn’t put any of it on. They didn’t even give me some of the stuff the base meal came with. Plus the food was terrible. Now these are all issues with the restaurant, but Uber eats offers me $3 refund in 3-10 business days and a $5 credit for my very incorrect and bad $30 order. I can’t justify paying every month for Uber one and getting such a terrible service all around. I had low expectations and Uber eats could not live up to them.

A week later I get a notification from my bank that Uber charged me $9.99 for a subscription at 10pm. I NEVER signed up for a subscription of theirs. They used my information without my permission AND signed me up for an UNWANTED subscription and charged my bank account. Then I go download the app back to see why I was charged and it would not let me unsubscribe for something I didn’t even get in the first place. This just made me more angry seeing that I am trying to go to bed and at 10pm they charged me for something I didn’t get. They were trying to be sneaky with this charge because it was at 10pm so they probably thought I wouldn’t be able to catch it. I just deleted the whole account. I am mad and will never use this app again . If it was possible I would give them ZERO stars. If you go on Google and search “why is Uber charging me $9.99” they will tell you that they have probably forced you to subscribe to something.

Once the order is dispatched to the driver, the driver then sits one location for about 20-30 minutes while your order dies at its location. When you contact the “help” desk, they won’t allow you to cancel your order (you’ll have to pay anyway if you try to cancel while your driver sits on your order.) The app will continually update your order delivery times with no record of the previous time that was stated. You can not get your money back after paying for priority delivery service.

Customer service usually need long wait times, so many back and forth conversations, and don’t know how to solve the problems. One case I had they needed to engage other teams and it took two days to solve the issue. It was quite instant before.

The bugs also didn’t help. The latest order I had was using a hotel I stayed at a while ago, usually other apps reminds me that the location is too far and ask for correction / confirmation, somehow Uber Eats overlooked it and didn’t tell me anything. I only figured out later when the driver is already on the way - just gifted the food to the driver. These little things matter - I hope it’s a bug not a design failure. Having a function to add temporary address and make them non default seems pretty straightforward. Reminding customers when the location doesn’t seem right also seem like a feature that’s necessary.

2024-09-16 03:32:16,"Unfortunately I tried to rely on this service for a long time and got many disappointing results. I did not receive my food several times. My money was refunded at about an 80% rate. My food was not made to the specifications I entered and I was refunded at a roughly 30% rate. This is unacceptable and no longer an app I will use. I would recommend that you try any other available option before trying this. They do not stand by their product. Almost every time, at least 90% of it, the food is more than twice as late as their app says. They never compensate you for it or allow you to cancel. 

Tonight was the last straw for me. I ordered 6 items and 5 had missing ingredients or were the wrong item entirely. I wish I could provide more details but I have since deleted this app. Their solution tonight on my $93 order was to award me a $6 refund.

I look again at around 2:15 as my food hasn’t arrived and he’s still at the same location and now my food’s eta is now 2:36. I’m upset but I decide to keep waiting. Then a few minutes later I check again, still at the same spot and now my eta says 3:44 so I contact the delivery driver asking if everything is okay, no response. I contact customer support and they are extra unhelpful. They tell me my only options are to cancel the order or get 20% discount from my order. I tell her that I am still dissatisfied and disappointed. I wasn’t expecting a free meal, just someone who was more compassionate and not robot-like. What’s the purpose of talking to a human if they just give out robot-like repetitive answers. Awful. Will not be using this app anymore.",1,App Store,UberEats
2024-09-30 00:15:40,"App works fine but also has a lot of shortcomings I.e. no restaurant hours, doesn’t show location of restaurants, has A TON of “virtual restaurants” with cool, exotic sounding names/menu items that look better than cheap restaurant food. These are also more expensive and sometimes have extra delivery fees. These restaurants are not real, they are places like Big Boy, Coney Islands, and other cheap restaurants disguised to fool customers and charge them even more than they already do (every item is at least a few dollars more expensive on here than in person or ordering directly from the restaurant). Also, they pay drivers $2 per delivery and don’t provide much or any incentive for drivers to deliver orders with care (using insulated bags, pizza bags, messaging customers updates, driving the fastest route, etc.). This also leads to many people not tipping drivers or leaving very small tips because they don’t do a very good job of incentivizing customers to tip higher amounts or add more tip for excellent service. The executives make millions and millions over charging and utilizing those in need of work so badly that they tolerate $2 per order. It is very convenient and has many options which are positives and likely the only reason people still use it. But I would love to see the issues listed above change.",1,App Store,UberEats
2024-09-30 02:09:02,"A lot of my issues with uber eats are usually food related, restaurants frequently forget parts of orders or send the wrong items, however, today my problem is with uber itself. I’m terribly sick and feel like death so I wanted to order some covid tests and medicine to check if it’s covid and start trying to get better as I’m in a lot of pain and it’s keeping me from sleeping even. I click the option to “leave at door”, naturally, as I don’t wish to get the driver sick as well. Problem is, I get a notification saying it can’t be left at my door and I have to meet them at my door instead. Why would I have covid tests and cold/flu medicine ordered to me to avoid getting others sick, just to have to get too close to the driver in order to get my order in the first place? Does uber not care about their drivers? Are they okay with possibly spreading covid/the flu etc? Would it not make more sense to allow the order to be left at the door to keep their drivers safe? I don’t know, but I’m gonna order through doordash as they seem to have a better handle on things like this.",3,App Store,UberEats
2024-10-01 10:45:41,"I have had a heart procedure and we had been out of power because of the hurricane. We couldn’t make food and and a couple friends thought got us some gift cards to help us through. 

Let me preface that I use Uber eats a lot for my businesses and for when we have parties. We use Uber a lot to because we don’t drink and drive. We are fortunate enough to be able to treat ourselves. 

We placed an order and it was taking a long time. I tried texting the driver who was just sitting there. Carlos, was unresponsive. I went down the rabbit hole of Uber eats auto response help center. I was told that the restaurant hadn’t started preparing food. At this point we were really hungry and decided to cancel because we couldn’t get anyone to help. We tried calling the driver again and nada. So we cancelled. 

Uber charged us for everything. There was no warning or even mention that this would be a possibility. 

So I go over to the help center - they were copying and pasting responses. They couldn’t understand the issue of me unable to do anything. I was making arrangements for something else but we couldn’t do it because they stole our money. All I received is so sorry and we will use this as a training experience. I asked for a supervisor, a number to call and they were unable to provide. If only the driver would have responded….

So, no more Uber products for me. 1 personal and 2 businesses are walking away. I’m disgusted",1,App Store,UberEats

They deliver to wrong address, miss items, won’t refund, and take forever. They don’t care and you’ll get charged for it all. One day I ordered an egg sandwich and a soda. Wawa deleted the sandwich and they were intending to deliver a soda only for $12 to my house (their tipping is high). I cancelled (obviously) and got charged $3 for Uber eats error. It was bait and switch! They said they had the food and when I ordered the food, they said it’s not available - and I got charged $3 for a cancel. This is only one of many issues I’ve had. They delivered 4 times to the wrong address and I was charged over $100. The charges are so much higher than door dash. I added it up and was astounded at how much more. This companies policies are predatory and unethical. Do yourself a favor and download door dash instead. They refund practically everything if you reach out even give credits if there’s an error.

Uber Eats you can do better. The drivers canceling orders before they tell the app they picked it up. Then they cancel with a lame excuse, and keep the food, which the app doesn’t know nor does the  restaurant know after the driver stole it.
 Then me over here waiting like a fool. The dumb app tries to find another driver cause it doesn’t know the “thief”driver already got the food then dipped. Not only one driver but 2 drivers tried to pick up my food that was already picked up by the thief driver. The last driver was nice enough to reach out to me & told me what happened so I can report it. The customer support doesn't care if they lose money. Uber eats must have enough to keep feeding thieves. Plus give me my money back & pay the restaurants too. UE you need to come up with some better policies!

2024-10-11 22:01:35,"I am extremely disappointed with my recent experience with Uber Eats as a loyal payed member. Due to the aftermath of Hurricane Milton, I have been left without power and water, and I was simply trying to order a hot meal. I placed an order totaling $44 but quickly realized I had the wrong delivery address since I had recently moved. I tried to change the address just a minute after placing the order, but Uber Eats informed me that my new location was too far for delivery. As a result, I decided to cancel the order, assuming I could order somewhere else with the correct address. However, despite cancelling less than 10 minutes after placing the order, I was still charged the full amount. I reached out to customer support, hoping for some understanding and assistance, especially given my difficult situation during a hurricane, but I was met with rude and dismissive replies. One representative even ended the chat on me as I tried to explain that I had no power or water and was just trying to get a meal delivered. This is completely unacceptable and feels incredibly unjust. In a time of need, I expected a higher level of service and empathy, but instead I was charged for food I never received and treated poorly by your support team. I will reconsider using Uber Eats in the future if this is how customers are treated.",1,App Store,UberEats
2024-10-11 22:10:28,Customer service is basically nonexistent. I have had problems before but this time is the last straw. Placed an order and received a notification 20 minutes later saying that I cancelled my order and it was refunded. Took another 29 minutes to actually get a customer service representative because the app itself offers no options to actually reach them aside from sending prewritten prompts to an AI which didn’t include my issue. When I finally got in touch with a representative he was very unhelpful and at first still tried to insist that I cancelled the order until I pointed out that if that was the case it wouldn’t have been fully refunded. He then claimed it must have been stolen by the driver so the system automatically cancelled and refunded me but I didn’t receive any kind of restitution or even a small credit to make up for the fact that I now have no lunch as I work full time and had no time to re-order a new meal.

I got footage from my neighbors ring. As a young woman living alone it isn’t worth having strange unhinged men show up at my doorstep screaming at me! Also, the customer service I’ve (not) received as some one who has spent a lot of money on their app over the years (a lotttt of money I’m talking like thousands). Never got a refund when they delivered me wrong orders many times, I just ignored it because they make it such a hassle to contact them. And now this- over a month ago, I wrote the company a very brief message in app about these events and they never even bothered to respond, much less apologize for their employees yelling at me... so that really put me off.

2024-10-12 02:31:06,"Its been 4 months since I used UberEats, I don’t know why I came back. The stated delivery time is typically half the actual time, meaning you’ll end up waiting a good 30 minutes longer than originally promised, and the ‘no later than’ time simply updates later and later so you can’t cancel without incurring a fee. I don’t know if this is due to greed on the part of UE via stacking multiple orders with a single driver (yay for lukewarm soggy pizza!), I wouldn’t assume they are competent enough to do this deliberately rather than on accident, but I’ve had enough, this is my last order (October 2024), farewell!
EDIT: i left a 22% tip and still I had time to go get gas, visit the atm, go home and have a shower, change the load of washing then pour myself a drink. Pizza arrived stone cold about 10 minutes after the ‘no later than’ date as promised.

They ended up sending my money back  without explanation of the person nor did I get food then I went to Taco Bell Uber eats. I went ordering. I was waiting hours as well. I started ordering my food at 9 o’clock they told me that my food would be  alesst ready for pick up at 10:30 at the latest then the time kept changing to 11 to 11:30  to 12 in the morning, so then I ended up canceling my order on that because I have 5 children and it was a school night they had there baths and all just waiting on dinner  they never sent me my money back from Taco Bell because “the order was already preparing “ I waited it out til the next day then I contacted Uber Eats and never responded back to me once i kept calling and calling I got back to them.

My uber delivery driver was super nice about this situation and tried to call uber eats on our behalf because we weren’t able to contact uber eats or the original place about the wrong order. We go over, in person, to the location and it ended up being a super sketchy location where I was unable to access help. When I was placing an issue report for a refund, they only would refund the original amount of the drink and nothing else that I paid, which in general was a super long process for no reason as i gave tour photos for two different parts of their process.

When I reached out to customer support, they said they couldn’t refund me because the restaurant had already accepted the order. This just didn’t make any sense – if I paid, I should either get my food or no food but money back, right?

To make it worse, I called the restaurant, and they said they never even got the cancellation notice from Uber, so they went ahead and made the food. Uber basically charged me full price for an order I never got, all because they didn’t communicate properly with the restaurant.

It’s just really disappointing, and I feel like Uber Eats doesn’t care about their customers at all. If you’re thinking about using this app, I’d suggest looking for alternatives. It’s not worth the hassle or the risk of losing your money like I did.",1,App Store,UberEats

I’ve had issues every now and then, but for the last 10 or 15 orders I placed, ALL of them had issues. Missing items, incorrect items, late deliveries, etc… One took an hour before the driver told me someone else had picked up my order. No problem right? Just have them cancel the order and get something else. Support expressed their disappointment and apologized and told me I would be given a $10 credit to use. I never got that credit and was then told that they couldn’t provide it since I wasn’t charged for the order. Good customer service honors what their reps promise especially after a bad experience. What’s $10 to Uber?!! Nothing. Next day I order a pretty large order that came out to almost $50. I waited and waited and nothing. I check the app and the picture shows someone else’s door. GREAT!! Yet another poor experience. I contact Uber for a refund and low and behold, they say they can’t refund me. All they have to do is check the picture of the doorway that shows at least 100 times and see that the last picture is of someone else’s door. So I was lied to and then stolen from.

Pulled up to our house. Sat there and clicked delivered and drove off. Took no proof of delivery picture like he was supposed to. We even checked the neighbors to be sure we didn’t miss him getting out of the car. I contacted customer support and they said it was MY FAULT that their driver stole my food because I selected leave at the door and they can confirm my food was delivered solely based on the fact that the drivers location pinged at my address. When I asked about the proof of delivery photo, they ended the chat..I had $90 stolen from me and was forced to call my bank and file a dispute and now will have to wait and hopefully soon get my $90 back.

I checked all the way to the main road because I didn’t want my money to go down the drain and low and behold THE FOOD WAS NO WHERE. Not to mention the driver left a picture of his car console and not the delivery? This is insanely unprofessional and I now just got my money refunded but it also means that I don’t have food for work tomorrow.

2024-10-27 16:41:50,"Easily the worst food ordering service out there. I regularly use 6 different services (mostly due to certain restaurants just using one) out of those, this one has the worst customer service with the worst quality of service. The timeframes are more than double other delivery services and their fees are significantly higher. Expect it to take 2+ hours when ordering through here. The restaurants make the food when you order it, and then it sits for hours because they can’t locate a driver. I placed a DoorDash order at the same time as my most recent Uber eats from restaurants that are on the same street (unfortunately this restaurant is only on Uber and half the office wanted it). The DoorDash order was delivered in 20 minutes. I’m over an hour into my wait time with Uber, with another hour of waiting to go. I know when we do finally get our food, it won’t be edible.

And they don’t let you cancel orders. They will make you pay because the store accepted it. I understand that the food was requested so it should be paid for, but when I ordered my food and it’s well past the delivery time frame Uber eats gave me, and I’m talking hour to hours, I don’t want the food anymore so it’s ridiculous that the app insists I still need to pay for food I no longer want when the reason I don’t want it anymore is because the time frame I was given was false. Another issue is I have gotten my entire order wrong and Uber eats doesn’t give a full refund you still have to partially pay for a meal you didn’t order and if you want the order you did pay for you’re going to need to reorder wait and pay again.

For example in searching breakfast, I get all these places so far away (I searched by quickest delivery time) saying it will deliver it practically the time it would take for the drive.  For fun, I searched for one to two restaurants nearby and they had quicker times to get to me.    I can’t trust the app search function when I want to be open to trying places, especially after they killed the “if it doesn’t get to you by X estimated time you get $5 back thing”.

The offshore customer service department is by far one of the worst I have ever experienced. I was traveling for work with no transportation options during my visit. I placed an order with a highly recommended restaurant an hour before the closing hours. After receiving confirmation the order was received, processed, and picked up by the driver. I was then notified the order was canceled and a refund was issued. Unfortunately all other restaurants were closed at this time. When I reached out to support I was told Uber eats cannot control if the restaurant closes early. As I began to ask why I had received notifications that the order had been through the process I was told it’s out of their control and I should reorder somewhere else. I tired to speak with a supervisor but was told they could not connect me for more than an hour. That would mean I would need to wait until 11:30pm to even continue the conversation. I was told I wasn’t being clear in my message and because the customer service representative felt I was talking in circles that she needed to end the call and hung up on me. I will say I was extremely respectful and never rose my voice or cursed. I simply asked how we could come up with a solution. The only response they were willing to offer was “we’re sorry and you won’t be charged”. Awful! Just Awful.",1,App Store,UberEats
2024-11-09 23:01:01,"Every time I’ve used Uber eats there’s always a problem with the delivery time where it’s gonna be delete an hour and an hour and a half, which is very unprofessional. The last time that I ordered with Uber Eats, I had to wait two hours to get my order, in which I ended up canceling because when I checked the driver’s location, she was on her way to pick up another order, so the time that I was actually given, it wouldn’t have been delivered by that time. So overall, I would’ve waited over two hours and a half to get my order. And when I reached out to customer service, they told me they could not refund me because I’m going to cancel it on my end. I would rather recommend DoorDash for anybody doing orders rather than Uber eats because they have no respect for their customers time. I tried speaking to two different customer service people, and they both ended the chat without even finishing the conversation that we were having. So I ended up paying for a food and the driver did not deliver it so because I canceled it the driver gets to keep the food that I paid with my own. Do not order with Uber Eats because they’re a scam and they do not care about their customer, All they care about is their money so beware",1,App Store,UberEats

I’m paying to have my orders delivered to my door NOT so that I walk a block to meet the driver. So frustrating!!!! Stop hiring mediocre drivers. Not only are they rude, unprofessional, and slow…. they don’t speak ENGLISH!!! Yesterday I have poor customer service with an Omer who waved me off. All drivers justify themselves with “ oh well the map tells me otherwise”        They don’t read the notes!!!! Seriously I’m thinking about canceling my membership with you guys because you obviously don’t seem to care to lose customers. We pay for an excellent above and beyond service.

The driver dropped off one small bag, with a three things and not my order. I contacted customer service for a refund, which sometimes Uber is good at. I have only used their refund system when the orders are actually wrong, and I didn’t get what I paid for. They it said it’s not eligible for a refund, so I went to chat with a rep. They said it’s not eligible for a refund. I asked for a supervisor, or contact information. There must be some kind of mistake, how could it not be eligible to be made right? The chat rep just continued to say not eligible for a refund and refused to give me any reason why.

So I contacted my credit card company, explained the situation and provided screen shots. The credit card rep reversed the charge. Uber then forced me to pay for a for a meal I never got, by preventing me from ordering a ride until I repaid the dispute I won. This should be illegal. I hope someone in customer service sees this so they can fix it for other people, for me it’s too late. Grubhub and Lyft are fine.",1,App Store,UberEats

I was charged twice for an order and I contacted Uber and told me they would refund it. It still hasn’t been refunded so I called my bank and they said Uber hasn’t issued a refund for it. It was $50 EXTRA I was charged. Then yesterday I ordered food and waited outside for the delivery driver who ended up stealing my food which was $40. In the last 24hr I’ve talked to six ppl and they flat out refuse to help me. I’ve been a loyal customer for YEARS! One person I talked to I asked for a supervisor, they said no then hung up the phone. First person I talked to when my order was ongoing did not help me properly from what the 6th person I talked too said. Every person has talked too has refused to let me speak to a supervisor. I was told it would take less then 6hr for someone to email me about this issue, and it’s now been more then 24hr since this delivery driver stole my food. And 3 days since Uber over charged me.

2024-11-15 15:08:00,"About a year ago, my best friend died in a motorcycle accident and I didn’t leave my house for 9 days. I didn’t eat for 9 days. On the ninth morning I woke up so fragile and weak, I nearly passed out trying to shower. I finally decided Uber Eats was my only option to get food in my system, and when the delivery driver arrived, I fainted opening the door. They got me inside and woke me with chilled water on my forehead and the smell of Taco Bell jolted me back to life.
The UEDD (Uber Eats Delivery Driver) proceeded to nurse me back to health by hand feeding me one bite of Taco Bell’s Crunch Wrap Supreme at a time until i finally had the strength to feed myself. When they left, they gave me their number and their Church and told me I could save more than just my earthly life.

2024-11-16 01:43:04,"Delivery times in this app have become a huge bait and switch. My consistent experience over many recent orders is seeing a delivery estimate like 45-65 minutes on the checkout screen, and then as soon as checkout is finished it changes to 60 minute estimate with the latest arrival time being 90 minutes from order time. This makes the range effectively 60-90 minutes, not 45-65 like the prior screen said just seconds earlier. 

And it’s obvious why they do this. They want to pad the latest arrival time so they can stack the driver’s delivery route with other orders. I have been a paying subscriber for years, stayed through dramatic fee increases, and now I feel like the only way to get an order delivered at  the original estimated time is to pay the additional $3.99 (or whatever) for priority, because the standard is just a bait and switch where they stack other deliveries, arriving later with cold food.

We have spent thousands of dollars on this app. Unfortunately, more often than not, there are issues with orders, items missing, late orders, etc. When paying a substantial amount of money for your order, delivery fees, and driver tips; as a customer you expect these orders to either be correct, or you expect to be refunded for the items you never receive. After being forced to seek refunds multiple times because of RESTAURANT AND/OR DRIVER ERRORS, UberEats has now decided that I have “violated the refund policy”. If it is violating the refund policy to ask for your money back for services and items you did not receive, then I am forced to take my (embarrassingly) thousands of dollars in delivery orders elsewhere. It’s a shame that a company cares more about the few dollars I was rightfully owed - than the future business I, and the rest of my friends and family (and anyone I come in contact with regarding delivery services).

The delivery driver was great, and because of her action i at least got the right drink, but the store gave me none of the food i ordered AT ALL. And when i went to get support, they denied me a refund. I started the complaint immediately after opening the bag, the ticket on the bag was the correct order (a kids cheeseburger meal with bacon added, apple bites x 3, a toy, and two drinks) instead i got a fry, and a random burger that was not even customized correctly with the things i PAID EXTRA TO ADD INTO IT. Even with photo evidence i was denied a refund. If i had the money to spare, i probably wouldn't care, but i am extrememely low income and have severe depression and i needed the food i ordered as i was unable to leave the house. I couldn't eat what they sent and it went into the trash. I am livid at their lack of accountability.

The biggest issue is the routinely missing items ordered and yet, Uber Eats refuses to refund those items. If you complain about the missing items, poor quality, or partially eaten food, you are punished. Uber Eats refuses to refund or even discuss the issue with you. Instead, the company writes you off as having “repeated violations of our refund policy.” The refund policy must be you can only complain once or twice regardless of the validity of your complaint. The company refuses to believe it has a delivery issue and instead blames the customer. Many customers do not like to complain, but those who do are punished.  

This would never happen when you go into a restaurant and sit down. However, with the lack of accountability with restaurants and/or drivers, the customer continues to get ripped off. I am boycotting Uber Eats.",1,App Store,UberEats

The price overall was 40 dollars because it was a little out of the way. When my full order didn’t come I made a detailed complaint and showed proof that only the shake came in. I also explained how I attempted to reach out to my driver and they completely ignored me. I asked them to reach out to the driver first because I didn’t want to jump to conclusions. But they didn’t even tried and told me that I wouldn’t get my refund or my food and that the order was “delivered successfully”. Now this was the third time in a row something like this had happened so I was very suspicious that the app was just stealing money from me or something like that.

I’ve been give “credits” and “refunds” that never happen. I’ve never gotten a credit and actually had it show up on my account but I’ve had countless emails explaining I was given a credit or a refund or BOTH for messed up orders. Never gotten any money back or an actual remedy. Deleted Uber and Uber eats today after the “support” representatives refusing to answer my questions and ending the chats with me after replying once and not answering anything. They don’t even give me a second to reply or if I do they still end the chat. I don’t know if they’re timed or they’re just not friendly people I get it it sounds like a stressful job but me as a consumer can’t understand how the customer service is SO awful every time and how I have never actually been given any remedy to any of my order mishaps even after being promised these things.

Regarding the issue, I was able to call the restaurant and they ended up making my order and I went and picked it up.

I ordered food a few times and they gave me the wrong order but when I get support involved, I didn’t get refunded the delivery fee and tip despite being refunded for the order which is obviously frustrating because I didn’t even eat the wrong order I was given.

It seems that the responses provided by representatives are often scripted and repetitive, indicating a lack of genuine listening to customer concerns. Promises made about a manager returning calls have not been fulfilled.

Additionally, I faced challenges when attempting to cancel and reorder an item shortly after placing the order due to an unrecognized discount. The company's explanation for not allowing this was that the food was already in preparation at the time of the cancellation. When I followed up with the store directly, I was informed that they could not assist since it was a third-party transaction. However, I was assured that if an order is canceled, there should not be any cancellation charges, and it was confirmed that my order had not been processed.

Despite having received a receipt for the original order, there appears to be a lack of communication between the store and the third-party service regarding my second order, which the manager claims they never received.

In addition- when they make mistakes like the driver taking your food - they get away with it and you still get charged. Basically mistakes on their end is always permitted and it happens frequently but one small mistake and they say it’s within their policy to charge you hundreds of dollars AND charge you for a driver fee which never even picked up the order, so it’s a ridiculous company that I would stay away from. Also, I wasn’t able to escalate the issue because they wouldn’t directly answer me, ended the chat quickly by saying I haven’t responded in awhile which was literally less than 30 seconds. I can’t even speak to anyone on the phone because they say the help center allows you to which is also not true.

I find it frustrating and confusing that Uber is so pushy with these pop-ups.

When something goes wrong, Uber Eats’ support often feels unhelpful, offering automated responses and refusing refunds or credits even when issues are clearly their fault. It’s frustrating to pay for a service that rarely holds itself accountable for its mistakes.

Equally concerning is how they treat their drivers. Delivery workers, who are the backbone of their service, are underpaid, overworked, and subject to unfair policies. Tips often seem to be the primary source of income because Uber Eats takes a significant cut, leaving drivers struggling to make ends meet. For a multi-billion-dollar company, this exploitation is unacceptable.

2024-12-21 20:37:01,"I used this app a lot, and only recently, and only because of a TikTok vibes with similar problem, I started to suspect of being charged extra. And whenever I make a order I now realize after doing that math, that whenever I make a order lets say it’s 20 bucks and it will as me to add a tip and  I’ll add one but once I have to pay, it says it’s almost a dollar more then it should be? And I tested it by putting zero as a tip just to see what it will say when I try to pay for it thru Apple Pay and then it does it again charge 50 cents or even a dollar more then it supposed to be? Why ? And I’ve noticed it doing it before. Of course couple cents here and there and I didn’t think it would go as much as a dollar but it did, and now I’m wondering how long has it been where it’s been charging a dollar here or there more. Idk how much more either if it’s just a dollar or even more?  But what is this extra charge coming from?",1,App Store,UberEats
2024-12-21 23:17:22,"Only reason not five stars because, the app itself is really simple and quick to navigate and to place order, it’s pricey. Not as pricey as say DoorDash which btw I wasted a ton on a few too many times before finding this app was cheaper then theirs. The tip option comes to higher then DoorDash’s but still about 10$ cheaper on uber eats so this is good enough for someone like me who has just enough money to avoid risking going out on these horribly crowded Pensacola streets. It’s getting downright scary cuz the police will not enforce speed limits and I can’t risk my life and/or about 40,000$ on a replacement vehicle like these rich kids can. So this is I’d say best option if you’d rather spend 50$ to 60$ to not cook and not drive. Hope this review helps others. If I use for groceries or anything else I’ll update👍",4,App Store,UberEats
2024-12-22 01:04:05,"Long time user of UberOne here. I usually enjoy Uber and ubereats but recently had a TERRIBLE time with their support team. The other day I ordered 2 coffees & breakfast and BOTH coffees were missing. This is not the first time I’ve been missing beverages from my order. Usually, support is helpful & a proper refund is issued pretty easily. But I guess they’re changing out support people or something because this was the most horrendous experience I’ve had with Ubereats. Not only was I already bummed to not get my coffee (even tried calling my driver to see if they’d bring it), I then logged it as missing and Uber told me they couldn’t refund me for the missing drinks I paid for?? When I asked for further support, 2 different people failed to give me a resolution. It took hours to get a response & the first person only issued a refund for ONE of the beverages, and when I explained this to the 2nd person they said the refund was “already issued” and didn’t offer any further solution. I now have to wait for a 3rd person & possibly contact the restaurant directly and/or my bank to finally get this resolved. If I can’t get a resolution to this issue, I will have to take my business elsewhere because arguing with support is not how I want to spend my days…",1,App Store,UberEats

The lady from kfc told me they are having the deal until 12:00am tonight but that she has no control whether I get the deal or not. Therefore, I called Roberto my Uber eats driver and asked him if I was getting the deal. I asked if it was two for one and he told me yes I am getting the deal. So I’m patiently waiting for my order to be delivered and i did not end up getting the buy one get one free (3 piece chicken with two sides and a drink).. only one.

And all they gave me was a $2 credit    I asked for them to at least credit the amount for the food and drink.  I didnt even ask for it to be refunded to card. They just kept saying gave gave me $3 credit to make it right. How is it on a 15 order  I couldn't even eat they only really give me $2 credit  so I lost out on $13 dollars and to even use the credit I would have to spend more money to have a meal delivered.  Cause I can't get anything for $2.    I spend $90 a week to take uber to work plus my house hold spends a lot of money with uber eats to be treated like that.   It was there drivers fault.

The problem is they put short-term profit before absolutely everything else, including customer satisfaction. They have your delivery driver take five orders from five different restaurants. After your food gets picked up, it sits in your driver’s car while he picks up the next order and the next. By the time it gets to you it is garbage. Meanwhile you’re paying what it would cost to go out and get yourself a positively stellar hot meal. The model only works because you stupid consumer pigs will buy anything if it’s on your phone. Why don’t you stop and think for a minute sometimes? You know what was cooler than summoning a car on your phone? The days when you could hail a taxi. As recently as 2014 I was able to step outside of my building, stick out my hand and a cab would instantly pull over and pick me up.

The order was picked up within 15 minutes and was only 10 minutes away from me so I thought it would arrive early. Upon looking at the route, my driver was taking. I noticed that it said he had additional stops he had to make. My food sat in his car for one full hour while he made three other stops. This is not the driver‘s fault this is Uber Eats fault for tasking drivers with multi orders. When my food arrived, everything was cold. There was also no utensils, even though I for them and I’m in a hotel that does not provide them. I’m aware that that’s the restaurant issue but the arrived cold when I paid $100 for one meal was unacceptable. Uber eats would not make any accommodation due to temperature.

After being reassigned a driver it added 20 minutes to the original delivery time. By this point I wanted to cancel the order, regardless of the fact that I would not be refunded. I asked FOUR TIMES for them to cancel my order, to which they would not. I was patient and used kind words, yet when I asked if they were saying I could not cancel the order, the person I was speaking to (Suraj) ended the chat, without answering my question or cancelling my order.

Due to other personal appointments, we needed to leave, so we canceled our order, which was likely going to be cold and unappetizing by then anyway. Uber Eats still charged us the full price of the order! When we called customer support, the representative was rude and completely unhelpful, reiterating that we would be charged the full amount.

I chose Uber Cash, thinking I’d definitely use the app again.

However, when I tried to place another order, the app wouldn’t let me. It said to contact support. After reaching out, they discovered my card was restricted. When I asked why, they couldn’t give me an answer and said they couldn’t lift the restriction.

This is absolutely ridiculous for a company as big as Uber Eats. You’d think they’d have a system in place to resolve issues like this quickly. While the customer service agent did their best and escalated my issue to a specialist, who promised a response within 12–24 hours, it doesn’t help me now.

They won’t even tell me what alleged terms of service I supposedly violated. It’s as though their support is completely automated or foreign and therefore is useless. So I guess if you are new to their service, you are at their mercy whether they allow you to join or not. Stick with Lyft and Doordash -at least those work and I think I’ve heard they are cheaper too. Doordash has great customer service if you have an issue with the order whereas they will at least give you a credit.  Uber support is useless if you run into trouble creating an account like I did.

Shortly after placing my order they tell me they’re out of an item and I had 10 minutes to make a change no biggie they have other dessert options so I am actively trying to change my order and the restaurant cancels part of my order before 1). the 10 minutes was up and 2). I was trying to pick a different thing to replace what they didn’t have. So all in all I should have at the very least been refunded $5 for the item I was missing. Instead they barely refund me $1 and tell me “Oh well your subtotal wasn’t $15 so I can’t help you” and the live support person ended the chat on me.  They tried to gaslight me by telling me “there was no dessert on there” but there was initially. How do you have someone pay for a subscription and not even honor the subscription?

I provided clear photo evidence of the incorrect items, yet they still denied my claim. It’s like they don’t even care about their customers.

The customer service is utterly useless. It’s as if their team is just going through the motions without actually reading or acknowledging complaints. If you’re not going to take real issues seriously, then honestly, you might as well automate the entire process. It would probably be more efficient and less frustrating than dealing with people who can’t even be bothered to look at a picture. This is the last time I’ll be using Uber Eats.

2025-01-21 20:34:13,"Uber Eats has its advantages, but there are significant drawbacks that make it a frustrating experience for many users. One of the main issues is the high cost. Beyond the price of the food itself, users are often hit with delivery fees, service fees, and small-order fees, which can easily double the cost of a meal. Adding a tip for the driver further increases the expense, making the service feel overpriced.

Another issue is inconsistent delivery quality. Food often arrives late, cold, or in poor condition due to delays or improper handling. While this might not be entirely Uber Eats’ fault, it negatively impacts the overall experience. Customer service is another major weak point—resolving issues like incorrect or missing orders can be tedious and unsatisfying, with refunds or credits sometimes denied even when the issue is clear.

The app itself can also be glitchy. There are frequent complaints about orders being canceled without explanation or tracking systems that don’t update accurately, leaving users in the dark about their food’s whereabouts. Additionally, the limited availability of certain restaurants in some areas and frequent “unavailability” during peak times can make the platform unreliable.

Overall, Uber Eats often feels overpriced and unreliable, especially compared to alternatives. For users seeking convenience and consistent service, it might not live up to expectations.",1,App Store,UberEats
2025-01-23 12:28:51,"I placed an order on the app quickly before a restaurant closed, without knowing a pin delivery was set up by the Uber Eats app for me. Usually my delivery is set to leave at door. The driver arrived and tried to contact me. Again, I did not knowingly set up a pin for my order, I’ve never used this pin feature before, so I didn’t have my phone around waiting for the call. The order was then marked as cancelled by the driver. The driver also never knocked on the door or even rang the doorbell to get my attention. Not only that, he took a picture and sent it to Uber Eats to look like he left the food at the door. In reality and according to my camera footage, he took the food and went home. This is a horrible loophole that Uber Eats has. When I tried to contact support, they couldn’t help resolve my issue. They claim that the driver delivered the food even though I told them I have camera footage evidence. So keep in mind for this pin feature, if you don’t have your phone on standby, your driver might never ring the doorbell and your food might get stolen as well.",1,App Store,UberEats

They charged me for the entire order and not even a credit for the lost food. So, they just took all of my money and no food or anything for something that would’ve been the exact same outcome if I had them cancel the order. I don’t know if that’s normal for uber eats but it’s asinine. So I will no longer be using this app or any of its services. Not to mention when I went and tried to complain to them they kept saying there was nothing that could’ve been done because it was 28 seconds after it had been sent in and the food was already done by then.

However, on a recent order, I ordered Taco Bell at around 1am, and the latest eta arrival was 235. I see my driver sitting in the same location for at least an hour. It’s now 3 am. I’ve texted him twice. He doesn’t respond. I get a call from an uber representative. They say “your driver popped a tire and will be unable to deliver your food”. I said, “Why didn’t the driver tell me himself like an hour ago when he popped the tire? Then asked for some sort of credit since I was now up at 3am with no Taco Bell. She was like “nah you gotta call customer support for that”. I’m like “aren’t you customer support”? Then she basically just said bye and peaced out. I went to sleep sad and hungry.

They never show you the final price at checkout after tips. Very slimy, I will never use this app again. I recommend the app Chow Now. I just did a side by side comparison of my order tonight and I am saving $8, (15%) by moving away from uber.

2025-02-05 19:50:20,"I had an incredibly frustrating experience with Uber Eats while on vacation. I placed an order, waited an hour at my Airbnb, only for the delivery person to arrive with my food spilled inside his carrying case. So now, after waiting all that time, I had nothing to eat.

Trying to resolve this was even worse. The Uber Eats app was completely unhelpful, and there was no easy way to speak to a live person. I finally found an 800 number online, but when I called, the representative was dismissive and unhelpful. I tried to explain how inconvenient this was—especially since I was on vacation—but all she kept repeating was, “Your order was canceled, sir, and you will receive a full refund.” That completely missed the point. The issue wasn’t just about the money; it was about my wasted time and now having to scramble to find something else to eat.

For a company as big as Uber Eats, I expected better customer service. They could have at least offered a promo or some form of compensation for the inconvenience, but they didn’t. If you run into an issue, don’t expect any real support. Extremely disappointing.",1,App Store,UberEats

The customer service representatives seem obsessed with immediately resolving tickets with no regard for what issues you might be having. Tonight I ordered some produce to be delivered to my apartment. When i got to my apartment to find the order, the produce was unbagged, poorly handled (crushed), some items were missing, and some incorrect. I took picture and went to customer service and  was denied a refund by a frustrated representative bc the food ""looked technically still edible."" Interesting observation. Anyway, i told them about the missing items and took pictures of the incorrect items and those messages were flat out ignored. I messaged after some time and my messaged had been put on hold for 6-12 hours while a special team resolves the issue. Ridiculous. I've had my food stolen by a driver and was denied a refund. I've had a grocery order never arrive and have been denied a refund. This is the last straw. If you value your time or money, go with DoorDash.

I have a ring doorbell and I have proof that my items wasnt delivered or missing yet uber eats refused to process a refund. This have been happening for over a yet. I’ve submitted the refund request and they denied it. For example last night I spent $60 on food that was never delivered to my home. I called the driver no answer I contact support they called the driver no answer thats because he kept the food and acted like he delivered it. The store told me the driver picked it up. This type of service is bad. I will never use this app again. I’ve lost over $500 if I was to calculate all my order since last year. This is the worst delivery service and terrible customer service. I realized they’re not for consumers only what they can gain and retrieve from us. I feel like I was stripped for my money when you have these terrible delivery drivers that steal from consumers. I’m sure I’m not the only one if uber eats behaves this way and treat their customers this way. There needs to be a lawsuit so that everyone can recoup the money they lost.

2025-02-11 21:38:58,"TLDR: Tried sending an Uber Eats order to my partner and it was sent to the wrong location. Restaurant did not accept order, but me nor my partner were able to cancel the order. UE customer service said nothing they can do so I’m not getting a refund.

So attempted to send my partner lunch from one of the vendors on the app (Subway), but since it’s a chain restaurant I did not realize I chose a location that was closest to me instead of the her place of work. I’m assuming since I sent the order as a “gift” option that it’s the reason why I wasn’t able to cancel the order within the first 75 minutes (according to UE). After receiving the link my partner was not able to schedule her drop off time of her order (even though that’s the prompt on the app when you select the gift option).

So I proceeded to contact customer support the first time. After some back and forth, it resulted in no solution and the associate explaining to just wait for the timer of the delivery window to run its course. That did not solve the issue so I contacted customer support a second time, and the associate gave me a run around explaining they aren’t able to cancel the order nor are they able to offer a refund.",1,App Store,UberEats
2025-02-15 07:43:17,"I was on the verge of collapse—my stomach growling like a caged beast, my vision blurring, my soul slipping into the abyss of hunger. The fridge? Empty. The cupboards? Barren. The outside world? A cruel wasteland of inconvenience. Just as I was about to accept my fate, a beacon of hope appeared on my phone screen. Uber Eats.

With the speed of a celestial chariot, my order was placed. I chose my meal like a desperate sailor grasping at a lifeboat, praying for salvation. And lo! The gods of Uber Eats answered.

A heroic driver, clad in the armor of a windbreaker and wielding a mighty insulated bag, emerged from the night like a divine messenger. As they approached my door, I heard the chorus of angels singing in the background. With trembling hands, I received my bounty—a feast fit for a king, a miracle wrapped in plastic and paper.

The first bite? Transcendental. My taste buds wept tears of joy. My body, once weak and weary, surged with newfound energy. I felt reborn, like a phoenix rising from the ashes of hunger. Uber Eats did not just deliver food—they delivered salvation.

I now worship at the altar of Uber Eats, leaving offerings of five-star ratings and generous tips. They are not just a service; they are a lifeline, a deity, the answer to humanity’s greatest struggle: hunger.

Would I use them again? Absolutely. In fact, I may never cook again. Why challenge fate when Uber Eats reigns supreme?",5,App Store,UberEats

He came all the way to my dorm to ask me for the pin.. I gave it to him, then he proceeds to say that the restaurant was closed and he couldn’t get me my food. I tried contacting support, which in itself took so long, then when I finally got in contact, they said we can’t help you because you gave him the pin! It’s my first time ordering from uber eats rather than DoorDash and I didn’t know this rule, but sure enough that didn’t matter to them. This is definitely my last time ordering from this app, trust me you would rather order from DoorDash than order from this scam of an app. Since they don’t want to refund me, I will use every opportunity I have to thrash them on social media.",1,App Store,UberEats

I care about the fact that the first driver took off with my order and the restaurant wasn’t going to remake my order. So that driver needs to be deactivated and banned from ever using Uber services. That was criminal. My husband and I are thinking about suing. Because this has happened before. How can we rely on Uber Eats and DoorDash when this happens!?

There have been multiple occasions where unfortunately food was never delivered or main courses were missing from my orders. You would think you could simply report it and get your money back for the missing items or lost order. Unfortunately that’s not the case and in one of the biggest slaps to the face i had lost nearly 25 dollars after not getting a refund on a missing order and getting a mere 40 cents. It’s honestly laughable how Uber Eats has a great system set for reporting these mishaps yet when it comes to delivering that customer service they miss it big time.

Pretty much impossible to cancel an order even though I tried within seconds of clicking the order button. I called the assigned uber driver and he told me he cancelled the order for me. I put my phone away because I was at a memorial service.

Not only that, the Winn-Dixie receipt and my Uber Eats receipt had a $25 difference and their reasoning was “ sometimes the items are more expensive or CHEAPER in store but we don’t change it to the cheaper price and still charge you higher price on our app”’. Mind you the delivery was 0.00 FREE and taxes amount does not add up to $25 so Uber Eats literally charged me an extra $25 when the items I paid for from Winn-Dixie where cheaper .

Sometimes I don’t know if or what my tummy will be able to handle in the next few hours let alone throughout an entire week or two between grocery store trips. And so, Uber Eats is a service that I rely upon almost daily if not more than that simply because it helps me, as disabled human being, to make sure I eat enough food to help my body and gives me the ability to not waste so much of my energy going out during times when it’ hard enough to sit up at my desk and write this review.

The only real problem in the website is that 1, you can’t send feedback about restaurants which have problems(for example a restaurant I ordered from multiple times with a week had my order processed but cancelled when the driver got there) another problem is the drivers, most of the time it’s fine but sometimes you’ll get some thing like a driver accepting your order and either forgetting or dragging it out until you cancel it so as to not ruin their record. It’s kinda annoying and you can’t report this at all because you can only review drivers who completed your order. The final problem is that you can’t increase tips during the delivery process, this is a problem when you put too low of tip and no one wants to pick up your food. Naturally most times that’s on you for tipping too low, but sometimes when the city you are in is busy even a higher tip won’t get accepted and you gotta cancel your order or wait and pray you get a driver who will accept it.

If uber could please hold responsible to their drivers and maybe we wouldn’t have such issues as this. Also the customer support that we receive in this issue does not understand how to respond when such issues are happening. Of course if we cancel we get charged, if not we wait for such orders to come which is 50/50 chance it does and when we finally get their attention we get what? A 20% discount from what we paid. I give them one thing though, your choses for fine restaurant is outstanding but if I have to wait 1 hour and 30 mins for an order that was suppose to arrive half of that and your response is to say that there is “traffic” then best believe you will lose customers.

You are letting your drivers take my food or leave it where ever is basically what you are doing.

When I place the first order, it’ll give me places I can bundle with, but inevitably it’s never the places that I want to bundle. So I’ll make two different carts, which in itself is stupid, then I’ll place the first order, look in the bundle section for the second place, it’s never there, so I go back to the second cart and place that order. And I’ll then reach out to the driver second after placing the order, but it’s already too late. They’ll be two drivers listed.

This is a problem for me because I give them a good tip in the app, but I usually like to add on a few more dollars after they deliver the food if they’ve been relatively fast with it.

Please bring back real customer support where customers can speak with someone on the phone to resolve order issues, the automated/in app support only is not good enough especially for Uber One customers/subscribers, we need real support to resolve issues!  Thank you and keep the app growing!",3,App Store,UberEats
2025-03-09 00:42:35,"I’ve never had any issues with other food delivery services. The set up of the app is horrible. Can’t leave a detailed proper review of the driver or food. The WORST incident was I babysitting tonight and forgot to change my address. It prompts me AFTER I put the order in “looks like you’re far away”. I realize and go to change the address. It tells me it cannot change the address!! It was seconds after I put the order in! So I cancel the order to start over, it tells me there will be a $10 and change FEE!!!!! Plus I’ll lose the promotion. So I have to lose $10 bc you can’t allow an address change?! Why is the option even there?! What a scam. Instead of automatically changing the address like DoorDash you force ppl to pay a cancel fee for an oversight. It wasn’t like it was ten minutes later I did all that in under 2mins. Called customer service within 5mins if all this and she says “they don’t have the tools to change the address “. Stressful and frustrating. Luckily my driver was nice enough to bring it to my current address.",1,App Store,UberEats
2025-03-09 15:49:02,"For over a year I've been having problems ordering food to my house because for whatever reason the UberEats app doesn't recognize my address. They either think I'm living in a completely different neighborhood or they don't recognize the extents of my building complex. So even when I adjust the pin, they say it's not allowed to drop off over there because that's not my address. And when I try to talk to customer service, they tell me to refresh the app, they tell me to make sure the app is updated, they tell me to log in and out of the app, and nothing works. So I haven't been using UberEats even though I pay for Uber One. And even though my Uber rides work every time when I need to get picked up because they simply cannot understand my address to drop off food. And their customer service is completely useless because they fail to recognize every time what's the problem, even when I send them screenshots. So, if I could give 0 stars to this stupid app, I would. Unfortunately, I cannot.",1,App Store,UberEats

The hostility did not end until my boyfriend heard the commotion and intervened. I immediately contacted Uber support to let them know the issue. Unfortunately Uber support only provided me with copy and paste responses despite all of my begging and pleading to speak to a real person or actually have a real conversation with somebody regarding this issue. They simply provided me with a $7 credit and links to their community guidelines and refund policies for uber riders (which I was not a rider in this situation). I tried to contact customer support regarding this issue again today and received the exact same responses, that again, were copy and pasted and I was ignored when I request requested to actually have a real conversation. They no longer have a customer support phone number, so there is literally no way to actually talk to somebody if you have an issue. They clearly do not care about loyal customers nor the safety of them. According to the refund guidelines they sent me even if I was in a car with somebody on an Uber ride, and I was verbally abused by them, I would still not be refunded for that ride. In a world where women are currently in danger everywhere we look I would highly advise not giving a company who clearly does not care about your safety or well-being your money.",1,App Store,UberEats

Today I waited four hours for a meal delivery and the courier stopped responding to me and it took that entire time to speak to an actual sales representative to get a full refund and have them cancel the order. i'm updating this review to say that absolutely nothing has changed since I originally wrote it. There are also way too many buttons in this app. If you use VoiceOver on iPhone then most of the buttons don't even tell you what they are. It just says button and where it does say the function you cannot even click it like send a message, call etc. maybe most importantly when you go to help and it gives you options to click you don't even know what you're clicking. You just have to try them all.
Another update: Now the total and subtotal buttons do not even read the numbers so I have no idea what I'm about to pay. I have received no communication from Uber concerning the inaccessibility of this app which tells me they do not care about their customers and especially those with Disabilities of any kind.

2025-03-13 19:09:41,"I am heavily pregnant and ordered some food as I was not able to leave the house. It not only took someone 2 hours to get here but the driver showed up with no food in his hand and unable to speak English. He did not know what went wrong or where the food was nor could he communicate with me. I called the restaurant and the food was sitting there waiting on the driver.

When I called Uber they said that they can either give me a refund which would take 5 days or refund my delivery charge and wait on the driver to deliver my food. I kept telling her that the driver showed up empty handed and had no clue what was going on and yet she still was telling me to wait on the same driver to deliver my food because they can’t change drivers. The worse part of this was I was on bed rest pregnant with limited funds on hand and had now wasted $30. 

This app is a mess. Customer service is a joke. To be such a big company you should be able to change drivers on the back end and accommodate customers better. What if that was the last $30 I had on me? I would have to wait 5 days to get refunded??? I will be switching to another platform and make sure everyone I know does too.",1,App Store,UberEats

Their customer support? Useless. Beyond disappointed. Using the “help” option is a waste of time because they won’t respond to you for days at a time between each response or they will just quit replying to you all together. Calling uber eats customer support? Also useless. I had my food stolen twice on the same order and all they could say is “all we can do is report the issue.” Or oh you want a refund after not getting your order? Well Ig you will have to wait 1 to 2 days for an email. This company is a joke. Getting food delivered is suppose to be for convenience not headaches.,5,App Store,UberEats

The only deals you get are on groceries now, the old rewards system was so much better. Something that always has bugged me is that the order isn’t even prioritized if you’re a member. I just had my order cancelled after over an HOUR waiting on it because my driver had another order to pick up and drop off before mine, and on top of that I could see them on the map making a delivery for another delivery service. I placed my order a good 30-45 minutes before the restaurant closed. If they could have at least picked it up I still could’ve had it. And now it’s so late most restaurants are closed besides the usual fast food places. I’m moving soon, hopefully the town change will make things better.

I pay 15 dollars for delivery fees and tip and all that when I could walk to the restaurant got my food and walked back before my dasher would’ve been close to the restaurant. I use this app 5 times a week. You’d think they would try and make my service good considering the money I spend but no they go out of their way to make it terrible. All I want is someone to drive 5 mins to a restaurant pick up my food then drive 5 mins to drop it off to me and somehow it’s always a 2 hour process.

Unhelpful and patronizing customer service.

Long form: 
I decided to see if I could get my priority fee removed since my driver clearly went in the opposite direction and made multiple stops. Not a big deal, not mad at my driver and I would have gladly taken a simple ""No it's non-refundable"". Staff not only did not understand my question, but responded with a long patronizing paragraph about how I need to allow my driver time to deliver my order. I write back that I don't think they understood my question as that isn't what I asked, and they write back again saying that I need to understand that the priority fee doesn't necessarily make it get there fast due to traffic and the like. If you're advertising ""delivered directly to you"" and it isn't delivered straight to me, that's one thing. When after this, your support staff, instead of simply saying ""no"" sees it fit to lecture me when they did not understand my question in the first place, that's another.

After being allowed, we finally found our order right before the actual resident of that apartment was about to report the unknown delivery in front of their door. We had to run back out into the rain and back home to finally enjoy our order that had already at that point cooled down and the ice in the drink had melted.

Because the only options it was giving was cancel or just let the food go to my house and sit outside until I get off at midnight! It didn’t say get help or contact help nothing. Uber has no number to talk to anyone. Which is sad because if they paid attention the order in the app they could see everything that was going on. My order was 42 bucks! I was out of the delivery area. I had them delivered to my job before! Soon as they make me cancel they are closed and unavailable! That is a bunch of B.S.

In fact, I’ve argued that Uber One has virtually no benefits other than a very occasional “discount” on delivery.  I’m very displeased with how many stops are in a single delivery now and it’s to such an extent that short-distance deliveries take 15-30min longer than necessary. So now I have to wait for multiple stops, deal with all the extra fees that the delivery driver never gets cut in on, AND UberEats also tries to prompt us to pay an in-restaurant portion of a so-called tip (with calculations that are inflated by fees). It seems to me that UberEats should pay its drivers well enough that a tip can be truly OPTIONAL again. Because, why would
I possibly reward my driver an extra 10/15 bucks to take other people’s food to their houses?!

I did not noticed that when I placed the order, the store closed. Automatically, uber re-scheduled the order to tomorrow 8:30 pm without warning me about it. After I placed the order, I tried to correct the mistake by canceling the order. However, the system showed that it cannot be cancelled because the store is preparing the food. This is ridiculous! After complaining about this to the system, still the same argument remains and I was not able to change or cancel the order. More interestingly, as the store closes at 8:30 pm. My order was never delivered, but my complaint was also never resolved. I got so frustrated that I deleted this SMART app :). 40 usd wasted! Good luck!",1,App Store,UberEats

I knew because they were taking so long my food was likely getting cold. Eventually they got someone and lo and behold my food was COLD AND HARD nearly 1 hour later. Plus the cherry on top is my order was missing an item and the bag was ripped halfway open when it was delivered. 

Of course you can’t immediately report it because genius Uber Eats doesn’t allow you to say anything else while another concern is “open for investigation” which was me simply trying to cancel earlier. I’ve also noticed when you chat now they abruptly end the chat to transfer you to email. Someone was supposed to reach out 6-12 hours later. Nobody followed up until 2 days later saying my order was within normal ETA. So 1 hour is within priority delivery range? ETA was supposed to be 15-20 minutes as advertised.

The order was prepared within just a few minutes..but 1 hour 20 minutes went by without a driver accepting. I reach out and finally got past the help chat bot to talk to a real person, and they ignored my question. Offered literally zero help other than replying that I can reach out at the end of the “window”, which was 1hr50 mins after order placed. I’m sorry…. Why is 1 hr 50 min the end of the window?? The delivery claimed 60-75 minutes? But now I have to wait nearly 2 hours- not to have my order delivered- but to simply receive any sort of assistance?!

I ended up ordering through DoorDash and got my order quickly from Burger King instead. Awful experience with them over the years. It’s always pulling teeth to try and get your order fixed or submitting a complaint, when you’re a member and order frequently, for them to steal from you and outright refuse a refund. Awful customer service and just going downhill for years. I’m switching to a competitor that does right by their customers. I highly recommend to go for any other delivery services over Uber Eats.

Main issue that it took almost 2 hours to arrive, it was cold and soggy (perfect ground for bacteria to spread), damaged packaging brought to me by someone riding a bicycle (aka exposed to outdoor elements), and they completely overlooked all that. The only response I got after bringing that up, was they can’t issue a refund…? 

I can overlook the increased pricing for getting food delivered. But if I’m showing a genuine concern for my health and well being and that’s all I get in response? I expect some cookie cutter explanation, at least! But nothing? Also, they took 15 hours to respond….

Just seconds after I confirmed the order with Apple Pay, the total came out to $95—far more than expected due to excessive hidden fees. I immediately canceled the order, not even a full minute later, but Uber still charged me $75, claiming the restaurant had already started preparing the food.
That’s simply not true. The order was placed at 8:47 PM, and the restaurant closes at 9:00 PM. There’s no way the kitchen began making the food in under a minute, especially that close to closing time.
Uber’s practices here are deceptive, misleading, and exploitative. Customers should be fully aware of what they're being charged before committing to a payment—not after.

I would get a refund thank goodness but the drivers don’t get repercussion for actually stealing my food. I’m a college student so when I order food it’s because I cannot cook at the moment and a lot of the times this happens I go to bed hungry. It’s not fair I have to order food and expect to get it then i don’t get it so its too late to order anything else and i’m starving. Uber genuinely needs to start doing something about this and i’m sure it’s based on location where food theft is more common but they need to have a specific button for reporting stolen food. Usually this happens because an uber driver has the name for the food and they ask for the order after they dropped the order for another driver to pick up. Usually the second driver will tell me that my food as gotten stolen. PLEASE DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS UBER!,2,App Store,UberEats
2025-04-18 14:04:04,"I’ve been using the Uber app primarily for taxi services, but recently discovered that I was unknowingly subscribed to Uber One for over a year. The app did not notify me about this subscription or provide any clear way to view, manage, or cancel it. Charges were silently deducted via PayPal under the Uber brand, making it extremely difficult to notice unless you closely monitor your transactions.

This lack of transparency in billing and subscription management is very concerning. The app cleverly hides the Uber One subscription details and does not offer adequate notifications or reminders about the ongoing payments. The cancellation process is confusing and not user-friendly.

For an app as widely used as Uber, I expected better clarity and honesty in handling user subscriptions. I urge Uber to improve its user experience, especially in terms of subscription control, notifications, and account settings visibility. Be cautious if you are using Uber—always double-check your subscription status and payment history (Which is difficult to find).",1,App Store,UberEats
