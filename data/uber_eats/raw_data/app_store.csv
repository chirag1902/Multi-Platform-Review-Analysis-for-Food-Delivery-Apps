I chatted with another representative who was nice but could not resolve the issue and transferred me to someone else. I’ve been using Uber for years and never had this problem. I’m disappointed because I am not being heard and this issue is not being resolved. I would suggest everyone to check their receipt and statement after each order in case you are over charged a 1.00 or anything.

Well your service team responded said no refund and closed the ticket. No chance to write back and I can’t make any more claims about it and there’s no where else to contact any support. Your app support is absolutely terrible. Why can I not chat with someone real time? Why can I not call someone real time? So you know what, I canceled all of my Uber Apps because you guys essentially stole money from me when the drink is the drivers fault and the sweet potato fries is the restaurants fault. You really need to explain when you’re “rating” the order that that’s not how you’re supposed to go about getting a refund. In fact rating makes 0 difference and does absolutely nothing because if the guy had maybe looked into my account he would’ve seen that I did rate my order within 24 hours of the order arriving. I did it right then and there before I even ate the sandwich which was only 1/3 of my meal. So I won’t be going through Uber for anything anymore.

The total was $130 and so I went to the app to get help. I had the option to reach out to the driver and he said that was all they gave him at the restaurant. He said my bad and he would report the missing items and I could do the same in the app. I did an didn’t receive a response. Usually they tell you right away we apologize for the mistake.

My boyfriend then went down right away soon as I figured out he was waiting, which, as I said earlier was probably only five minutes, and then my boyfriend catches the Uber driver with our food and asks if it’s for him and the Uber driver just looks at him and says oh no and takes our food. He even took a picture of it and left a note saying he was leaving it at the door, but then did not and took all the food. I then contacted Uber to try and get a refund and I explained the whole situation and the amount of time and they still said we can’t do anything and you won’t get any refund. I just feel like that outcome is not fair because I did spend a lot of money on that food and I was in contact with the driver and he didn’t even wait that long.

Next, you’ll most likely NOT receive your order more often than receive it.

 Along with restaurants saying their open and when you place your order they close the restaurant and you again have to call customer service and ask for a refund or cancel and in reality it takes so long. Restaurants forget certain items and you have to experience the frustration every single time you order.  Some Uber drivers cancels your order.

I’ve had countless items be missing from my orders and whenever I go to get my money back they either close the case without giving me my money back or offer a small little 5 dollar Uber cash that isn’t even the equivalent of what I paid for and honestly doesn’t take much off the order. Even with my latest order I was missing a whole meal. I did what I was supposed to do and was expecting a refund cuz what I ordered cost at least 14 dollars. They hit me with the “someone will reach out to you within 48 hours” and when I did get a message it was just them saying that my food was all there and then closed the case! I had to order more food that night because I didn’t get my food. So to see that I’m not even getting refunded for that meal I never received gets me upset.

We immediately contact support to tell them that we didn’t get our two pizzas and our 2 L drink. 
And of course they wanted proof that we didn’t get those items with a receipt and a picture of what we got.

Also, they pay drivers $2 per delivery and don’t provide much or any incentive for drivers to deliver orders with care (using insulated bags, pizza bags, messaging customers updates, driving the fastest route, etc.). This also leads to many people not tipping drivers or leaving very small tips because they don’t do a very good job of incentivizing customers to tip higher amounts or add more tip for excellent service.

The only real problem in the website is that 1, you can’t send feedback about restaurants which have problems(for example a restaurant I ordered from multiple times with a week had my order processed but cancelled when the driver got there) another problem is the drivers, most of the time it’s fine but sometimes you’ll get some thing like a driver accepting your order and either forgetting or dragging it out until you cancel it so as to not ruin their record. It’s kinda annoying and you can’t report this at all because you can only review drivers who completed your order. The final problem is that you can’t increase tips during the delivery process, this is a problem when you put too low of tip and no one wants to pick up your food.

The delivery driver took extremely long with my food so I messaged him and got no response. I called him and he tells me that he is going home for the night!  He also did not cancel the order so someone else could pick it up! I contacted uber and they told me they could find me another driver which meant my husbands food would have been cold! The restaurant also closed in less than 30 minutes so the delivery driver probably wouldn’t have gotten there in time or my food wouldn’t have been remade. The customer service rep told me all they could do is cancel my order! It was also too late to replace the order because the restaurant was closing. So after working a 12 hour shift my husband is going to bed with no dinner! And uber said that they couldn’t give me any credit for my inconvenience. I feel as big as the company is that is extremely ridiculous and POOR service!! They kept telling me I’m getting a full refund like they did me a favor by doing so. I for sure better be getting a full refund for something I DID NOT GET!,1,False,Horrible customer service!!!!,briibraay,
2025-03-12 16:24:59,"On March 9th 2025 I, a 4’11 woman, was verbally assaulted by my Uber eats driver at my front door. The hostility did not end until my boyfriend heard the commotion and intervened. I immediately contacted Uber support to let them know the issue. Unfortunately Uber support only provided me with copy and paste responses despite all of my begging and pleading to speak to a real person or actually have a real conversation with somebody regarding this issue. They simply provided me with a $7 credit and links to their community guidelines and refund policies for uber riders (which I was not a rider in this situation). I tried to contact customer support regarding this issue again today and received the exact same responses, that again, were copy and pasted and I was ignored when I request requested to actually have a real conversation. They no longer have a customer support phone number, so there is literally no way to actually talk to somebody if you have an issue. They clearly do not care about loyal customers nor the safety of them. According to the refund guidelines they sent me even if I was in a car with somebody on an Uber ride, and I was verbally abused by them, I would still not be refunded for that ride. In a world where women are currently in danger everywhere we look I would highly advise not giving a company who clearly does not care about your safety or well-being your money.",1,False,DO NOT SUPPORT THIS COMPANY,63930272,
2025-03-13 13:48:56,"I've had way too many awful experiences with drivers to rate this highly. If you get groceries they never see the replacements you chose. Today I waited four hours for a meal delivery and the courier stopped responding to me and it took that entire time to speak to an actual sales representative to get a full refund and have them cancel the order. i'm updating this review to say that absolutely nothing has changed since I originally wrote it. There are also way too many buttons in this app. If you use VoiceOver on iPhone then most of the buttons don't even tell you what they are. It just says button and where it does say the function you cannot even click it like send a message, call etc. maybe most importantly when you go to help and it gives you options to click you don't even know what you're clicking. You just have to try them all.
Another update: Now the total and subtotal buttons do not even read the numbers so I have no idea what I'm about to pay. I have received no communication from Uber concerning the inaccessibility of this app which tells me they do not care about their customers and especially those with Disabilities of any kind. Absolutely abysmal.",2,False,If you're not lucky enough to get a good courier then this is a miserable experience,DeFreshMode,
2025-03-13 19:09:41,"I am heavily pregnant and ordered some food as I was not able to leave the house. It not only took someone 2 hours to get here but the driver showed up with no food in his hand and unable to speak English. He did not know what went wrong or where the food was nor could he communicate with me. I called the restaurant and the food was sitting there waiting on the driver.

When I called Uber they said that they can either give me a refund which would take 5 days or refund my delivery charge and wait on the driver to deliver my food. I kept telling her that the driver showed up empty handed and had no clue what was going on and yet she still was telling me to wait on the same driver to deliver my food because they can’t change drivers. The worse part of this was I was on bed rest pregnant with limited funds on hand and had now wasted $30. 

This app is a mess. Customer service is a joke. To be such a big company you should be able to change drivers on the back end and accommodate customers better. What if that was the last $30 I had on me? I would have to wait 5 days to get refunded???

2025-03-25 22:22:47,I ordered MATT’s barbecue. I placed the order to have it sent to my job. When I cashed out the address had changed to my home address. The only option was to cancel the order. Because the only options it was giving was cancel or just let the food go to my house and sit outside until I get off at midnight! It didn’t say get help or contact help nothing. Uber has no number to talk to anyone. Which is sad because if they paid attention the order in the app they could see everything that was going on. My order was 42 bucks! I was out of the delivery area. I had them delivered to my job before! Soon as they make me cancel they are closed and unavailable! That is a bunch of B.S. I would never trust them again I promise anyone comes up with a ride share or food delivery  I will help them to over throw uber they are such theives!

2025-04-03 09:35:48,"I paid for priority delivery. They switched drivers multiple times. I tried to cancel. They wouldn’t allow me to do so. I knew because they were taking so long my food was likely getting cold. Eventually they got someone and lo and behold my food was COLD AND HARD nearly 1 hour later. Plus the cherry on top is my order was missing an item and the bag was ripped halfway open when it was delivered. 

Of course you can’t immediately report it because genius Uber Eats doesn’t allow you to say anything else while another concern is “open for investigation” which was me simply trying to cancel earlier. I’ve also noticed when you chat now they abruptly end the chat to transfer you to email. Someone was supposed to reach out 6-12 hours later. Nobody followed up until 2 days later saying my order was within normal ETA. So 1 hour is within priority delivery range? ETA was supposed to be 15-20 minutes as advertised. Plus what about my other issues?! 

They could care less if you have been a loyal customer. Plus, fees are ridiculously expensive! Deleting the app today. Gonna try DoorDash instead.",1,False,Customer Support Nonexistent!!,If I Wrote A Review It’s True,
2025-04-04 23:48:29,"Absolutely ridiculous to claim “delivery times” that don’t end up being even remotely close to what they actually are. I’m traveling for work and yesterday I ordered a meal and it said 10-30 minutes. 5 minutes later it says delivery delayed, it’s now gonna be 1 hour. Then the next night, I think “I’m gonna get ahead of this and order my dinner super early”. It says 60-75 minute delivery time. Okay that’s fine. The order was prepared within just a few minutes..but 1 hour 20 minutes went by without a driver accepting. I reach out and finally got past the help chat bot to talk to a real person, and they ignored my question. Offered literally zero help other than replying that I can reach out at the end of the “window”, which was 1hr50 mins after order placed. I’m sorry…. Why is 1 hr 50 min the end of the window?? The delivery claimed 60-75 minutes? But now I have to wait nearly 2 hours- not to have my order delivered- but to simply receive any sort of assistance?! So by the time I finally get my food, it’s been 2hrs15 minutes and my salad is warm.

2025-04-07 17:37:52,"I’ve been a loyal Uber Eats One member for years and had many issues over that time, but stuck with the membership and ordered very frequently. April 6th, 2025 was the last straw. My order from McDonald’s was extremely late, switched between 3 different drivers and then the last driver came to my house to tell me he didn’t have my order and wanted to let me know, which is the weirdest thing to do and then the order was marked as delivered and I never received anything. I ended up ordering through DoorDash and got my order quickly from Burger King instead. Awful experience with them over the years. It’s always pulling teeth to try and get your order fixed or submitting a complaint, when you’re a member and order frequently, for them to steal from you and outright refuse a refund. Awful customer service and just going downhill for years. I’m switching to a competitor that does right by their customers. I highly recommend to go for any other delivery services over Uber Eats. Any issues with other delivery services, they fix things right away, including never receiving your order. Uber Eats doesn’t care about their business or reputation and screwing paying members.

2025-04-07 18:38:21,"If it’s a person, not an automated response, the customer service care is just lacking. Issues brought up that compromise food safety are not properly addressed by their staff. They don’t seem to care and believe the only reason I bring the issue up is because of a refund and completely ignored the fact that I’m concerned about the safety of my food. Main issue that it took almost 2 hours to arrive, it was cold and soggy (perfect ground for bacteria to spread), damaged packaging brought to me by someone riding a bicycle (aka exposed to outdoor elements), and they completely overlooked all that. The only response I got after bringing that up, was they can’t issue a refund…? 

I can overlook the increased pricing for getting food delivered. But if I’m showing a genuine concern for my health and well being and that’s all I get in response? I expect some cookie cutter explanation, at least! But nothing? Also, they took 15 hours to respond….

The drivers are not to blame, the system of Uber Eats is everything to blame for. I ordered from the McDonalds app which is another third party arrangement they have with Uber Eats. I ordered nuggets, fries, ice cream, and soda. Doesn’t sound like it would last long right? Anyway, I ordered from there and I’m quite literally 0.8 miles away meaning 5 minutes from McDonalds from my work location. I ordered it at 11:10 and waited. The McDonald’s app tells me it was picked up at 11:25. The driver, instead of delivering my food drives 25 minutes with ice cream, fries , nuggets and a soda to handle other orders before dropping off mine. He arrives at 11:50. The driver walks in nonchalantly to my store I stopped him and explained why this is ridiculous. All the “Genius” said was “the app told me to do it.” Uber eats gave me most of my money back but because McDonalds was another third party I got to ask McDonalds app for my money back like I’m some beggar. this is only a small story I can tell you compared to the rest of this horrible service I was given from this app. May you do yourself a favor and do not get Uber eats.

I ignored all those times an item in my food went missing or when my food came back destroyed and they refused to give me a refund or gave me about $2 in uber cash, which by the way what am I supposed to do with that when a $10 item I ordered was missing, and I continued to use uber because I’ve been a loyal customer for five years. Back in august my card got charged after a two week trial of uber one for the ANNUAL plan. I cancelled immediately and tried to dispute the charge. Long story short I’ve not gotten back my $96 and I also don’t have uber one benefits so they essentially stole $96 from me. For three months I’ve been trying to contact uber support to give me the money back because I’m a broke college student and they either don’t respond or lie and tell me it’ll be in my account within 3-5 business days, which is yet to happen by the way because it’s been 3-5 business MONTHS.

I contacted the delivery driver and got no response, I contacted the support team and was told to wait as “some drivers take alternate routes”. I continued to inform the support person that the driver was going nowhere near the location I set as drop off and they continued to ignore me. The food ended up being dropped off at someone else’s apartment complex and I never received my order. As I was trying to request a refund I was told my request was denied due to “waiting too long”. I then called support and was told that “because the food was made and the delivery was completed I cannot get a refund”. I then spoke to a third person who claimed that “I never attempted to reach out to support nor the delivery person” which is clearly false.
