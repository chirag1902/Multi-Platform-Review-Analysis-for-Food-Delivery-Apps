1k3dth4,post,Order got removed for taking too long to arrive Grubhub on some bs I swear they be doing anything to make sure you don’t get a bonus. Everytime I’m doing a bonus I have an issue and it’s always on the last order before getting it. Was doing a mission that was earn $20 by doing 6 deliveries and only skipping 1. I got a delivery where the restaurant was 29 min away I wouldn’t normally have done it but it was the 6th delivery and I already skipped 1 so I just wanted that 20 but first the order pickup time was at 11:36 when I received the order at 11:30 but it was 29 min away then 20 min into drive I get a message saying I was running late for pickup start driving to restaurant then 2 min later it got removed.  Actually some bs I’ve done orders where the pickup was 30 min away before and it didn’t do that and why tf was the pickup time 5 min after receiving order with them knowing I was 30 away.

1k2jutk,post,"Deep Cuts: Acceptance % while on shift If you play the scheduling game while working, you probably know that you need a 90% acceptance rate in order to receive your minimum shift pay. A lot of people think that means you need to accept 9 out of every 10 offers, and if you skip an offer, you need to hit those other 9 if you want your minimum. However it’s not quite that simple.

For instance, say you’re scheduled for a 10 hour day, which here means you would be guaranteed $150 with 90% or more acceptance.

Now let’s say your day was super slow, and you took 8 offers, and skipped 1. The offers that you took were $2-5 pay for long distances, and you’re only looking at like $32 for the day unless you get that last order.

Now you get the 10th offer for the day right at the end of your shift, with maybe an hour left of the night. It’s for $3, and it’s a delivery right across the street from the restaurant, but the restaurant is 12 miles away. 

Since you know this will be your last order to get your guarantee, then you know that this order is actually worth $118, and so you suck it up and take the order, and you get home 45 minutes late. You wake up in the morning, and see that you have $35 for the day and your acceptance is at 89%. Oops. So what happened?

Well your acceptance % actually seems to be calibrated by *distance* accepted, or the % of miles you are willing to drive, out of miles offered. So in this case, your total miles driven for the day were very high, but the final order you accepted was right across the street, so it didn’t accumulate a full 10% of your miles for the day. Even though you drove all the way across town to get to the restaurant, the miles counted are only between the restaurant and the customer.

So moral of the story, don’t zonk out and forget to check your % before logging out for the day, or you’ll be a broke bitch like me. Good night.

TLDR: Acceptance % is based on accepted driving amount from the store to the customer, not the number of orders accepted.",OldPurpose93,1745022438.0,2025-04-18 20:27:18,2025-04-18,20:27:18,0,0.25,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/grubhubdrivers/comments/1k2jutk/deep_cuts_acceptance_while_on_shift/,https://www.reddit.com/r/grubhubdrivers/comments/1k2jutk/deep_cuts_acceptance_while_on_shift/,True,,Deep Cuts: Acceptance % while on shift,new

1k1q2k8,post,"AITA Grubhub Edition I'm a substitute teacher that does gig apps like Grubhub on the side. I've only ever done about 5 GH orders though, as I mainly do IC and DD. I rarely order through these apps, but I missed lunch at the school I was working at and used GH to order from a place about 12 miles from the school. I usually tip around $8-10 for any orders I place, but I've been low on funds and tipped $6. In my limited experience, GH base pay was usually better than DD's, so I figured a $6 tip wasn't too bad.

Long story short, I was dealing with students and had missed a text from my driver asking for the code. I told them to leave it in the lobby in the app and tried to make sure all the instructions were correct. I wasn't aware that GH requires a code now. The driver called me and I answered immediately and saw the text was from 2 minutes prior. 

I was able to see the lobby entrance from my classroom. It was a man on the profile and calling, but I only saw a woman come in with food, so I didn't think he had even arrived yet. I answered and the guy said ""this is grubhub what's the code?"" and I politely asked ""are you in the lobby?"". He said ""nah shit, what's the code"" super aggressively and I just hung up. I was already overwhelmed dealing with unruly students, and that almost sent me over the edge. I waited a minute and he texted ""give me the code or your order will be cancelled"" and I finally texted it to him. I would've given him the code immediately if he had just said said ""yes I am in the lobby"" but his whole demeanor threw me off. I got my food, but gave him a 2 star for the way he spoke on the phone.

AITA here? I did some research on GH base pay later that day, and I see now that a $6 tip on a 12 mile delivery isn't that greatest tip. I will admit that I messed up not giving the code when he first texted, but I was watching out for him and he never even entered the building. I'm open to any feedback in case a situation like this arises in the future.

1k0yjcv,post,"Driver Incentive Programs: Ridiculous Offers I don't play the acceptance rate game. But I was curious, so I did a test. Since Grubhub only counts the previous two weeks in our stats, I decided to see what the highest level of their program means. I did this, by only going online each week just enough to hit the highest level. Now, the current week's activity does not show until the following Monday. 

I noticed that as I have technically qualified but it hasn't shown up yet that the system then starts to send me outrageously ridiculous orders. Orders that it never would've sent me before. I started receiving orders to go into a different city/county pick up and deliver an order for $8.00 at 20 miles. Then I received another order to go into another city/county for $7 and some change for 21 miles.

I am aware that if the system thinks I am going for one of their Missions then it will always offer ridiculous offers if I am getting close to succeeding. Those Missions haven't been worth it for a couple of years now so I don't even bother with them anymore. But if I accidentally get close to succeeding in one of those missions just by doing what I usually do then it will send me terrible offers until I no longer qualify for that Mission; in hopes I will compromise and take the offer. The system does track us. 

The picture that I've attached, shows a different, absolutely ridiculous offer that it sent because come the following Monday I would've qualified fully for their Premier program. The system wanted me to go from the city/county where I was at into a different city/county to pick up pizza from Little Caesars, then travel to a third city/county and drop the Little Caesars off. By the way, there is a Little Caesars in that city where the drop off would be.

For those who don't understand, these are the games that ALL of the food delivery apps play when it comes to their ""Driver Incentive Programs."" There is a psychological conditioning these companies are doing to get drivers to behave like trained monkeys. Their game is to be as manipulative as possible, create hope in the possibility of more money, establish a sense of desperation and then pounce. They dangle a carrot in front of a hungry mule as they are riding on its back.

It is sad to see so many drivers believe that those programs offer true value.

Edit: It's understandable that I have received negative feedback on this post. Unfortunately, many who now do gig work have never experienced what back-end management in a company looks like and the factors that they consider when creating and releasing a program. The goal is always to improve profitability in the company, but when creating a program the participants must ""feel like"" there is a value in it for them in order for them to participate. These companies have shareholders, and they must please their shareholders. To believe that these incentive programs are meant to benefit the driver demonstrates a lack of understanding of what actually happens in the background.

This, of course, does not mean that a driver cannot benefit from these programs, but it is highly unlikely, in many cases, there will be a true long-term benefit for the driver.

This post is my experience; in my marketplace. There is no long-term benefit for me in that program.

Comparing a gig job like this with DOT truck or commercial driving is ridiculous as DOT allows actual behind the wheel driving for 10 hours however aside from driving truck drivers can and often do additional labor intensive “work” up to 15 hours a day often including loading, unloading and tying an untying loads if not maintainence. 15 hours is insanely taxing on the body for pretty much any job as most jobs are 8 hours full time.
Even if someone actually “works” ten hours in GH with back to back orders or two orders and hour they are likely behind the wheel driving no more than six hours anyways rest of the time is waiting for orders or waiting at restaurants anyways.

I am just angry at this point and see them bag the first item of my order and tell them a new driver will be in to pick this one up.

I have experienced many app glitch  issues recently of a variety of natures involving assigned orders, washout, and inaccuracy/timeliness of orders being ready at the merchant, acceptance rate tracking %, and double orders that get stuck and you can't accept and therefore you have to call 3 separate times to a sorry Customer Service to get released in the app to proceed meanwhile you are losing valuable orders and time.  I have also been in danger delivering to orders over the last several nights and you have to argue with Customer Servuce to File a report which they never due.  I have being getting to Restaurants late night and tney regularly have no record of the orders.

Now, these Customer Service jokers want you to file all this yourself which can affect your metrics and result in violations.

This all started with their recent system update several weeks ago.

Let's hope the one that shows up this morning does anything but cause more issues.

Such a sorry, sorry excuse for a company!!!!  With the wear and tear on the car and price of gas, you really can only do this job in certain markets.

It is fundamentally flawed and unfair and heavily schews toward the company profits and customers.  Has nothing to add or help their internal customers- Us drivers.  If you can do this job part time and learn to patchwork through their algorithm of lies and deceit, then only, for a short period, does it make sense....

You can never reach a Supervisor and they never call back and none of these so called departments have I ever heard from via email in regards to adjustments on my account.

The last straw for me is glitches at cashout and then telling me sorry and we don't why and it should be directly deposited to your account later in the week.

if I have been able to park close to the restaurant, I would’ve already marked leaving by the time the person canceled.

I emailed GH support and they were no help either.

Is it region specific? I drive for Central NJ. I would really like to be able to use a digital card.

Any help or knowledge?

1jg2gsp,post,"Q: Can GrubHub reassign a different driver for an order or is it truly automated? If I may ask because I just want to make sure that the chat help gave me the correct info. Tonight I ordered a meal from let’s say O’Charley’s. Someone takes the order. However, the map is showing that they drove to a restaurant location approximately 5 miles to the west of my house. The order is being prepared by a location approximately 5 miles east of my house. Taking into account they may be picking up other orders, it’s still confusing as to why they would accept my order because they literally have to drive back, past my house, several more miles to the restaurant, and then back to me.

That’s a lot of driving for a simple order. I don’t know if they may have got confused and went to the wrong location seeing the restaurant name? I’m in Metro ATL so there are tons of drivers in the area who would’ve been a lot closer to the restaurant and Me to pick this order up. Could the app have given the driver the wrong location information?

Either way once it became a parent that was going to take a lot longer to get the order I did chat help to see if it could be assigned to a different driver because she wasn’t even halfway to the other location yet. But they told me it’s all automated and that this isn’t possible. Since I don’t know exactly how this works just curious if this is true or not?

Update: driver eventually made their way to the correct restaurant but picked up a completely different customers order and brought me that customers order. Chat help was no good. I was however able to reach the driver who claims she is picking it back up. Called the restaurant to have them look out. I appreciate her going back if she indeed does but there’s no way to track it on the app at this point.

Picked up 1st order almost immidiately. 2nd was an Indian Restaurant. She flatly told me to come after 1 hr because they were on their lunch break??? 

She also said - she already informed GH about it thru the app.

Called GH - associate was nice to begin with but his niceness ended there. He said wait for the 2nd order??? 

I said - 1st order food might get cold and customer may not be happy. He said NOT A PROBLEM??? but if you want to unassign your ratings will be affected???

I used my COMMON SENSE and unassigned just to take care of quality of food for 1st customer.

Folks what kind of world GH is living in? - So I compromised on my ratings to make GH customer happy... even though I was PREMIER ...

Why GH is so possessive of Ratings and are driver Ratings more important then making customers happy? 

DD,UE would have unassigned without any impact on ratings after confirming with the 2nd restaurant because its a COMMON SENSE. There is always the next driver to take care...

1jcb4cr,post,"So do Program Levels even mean anything? I've been delivering Grubhub here and there on the side for a couple years now but have only recently started consistently delivering each week. I learned about program levels and decided to gun for Premier level, and was excited that I managed to keep everything at 100% for a week. Based off of what I'd read there were a bunch of perks to being above Partner level, but I haven't seen the fruits of my labor yet. 

Tonight has been without a doubt one of the worst nights I've ever delivered. I kept getting orders that were roughly upwards of $8 all the way down to one order that was $2.76 for over 5 miles. There were multiple orders around the $3 range. I had a block from 7-9:30pm and right before I was set to clock out at 9:30 I got a barrage of orders. Normally I would have been fine with working a little later than planned but the first order was sub-$3 from McDonald's, the second AND third order was from Burger King, BOTH for $2.98 (probably the same order thrown at me twice.) I decided to ignore those orders because I could not mentally handle that low of prices after already dealing with sub-$3 orders earlier so I ignored them, and as a result my acceptance rate plummeted.

That absolutely set me off. It felt like I was having better nights when I was at Partner level.

1j9s391,post,"Deactivated not my fault Just a rant: 
I get a lot of orders on a military base. After spending an entire day turning them down, and receiving no other orders off base, I decided to just go for it. So I started taking base orders and got into the habit of calling or texting the diner to meet me at the gate, as per grubhub policy. Sometimes the diners don't want to meet at the gate so I have to call support to cancel the order. Now I've noticed some support staff simply cancel the order and some tell me to mark it as delivered. They literally told me to mark the order as delivered and dispose of the food. After getting two violations for this I started arguing with support telling them I don't want to mark it as delivered because I'll get a third violation. So support staff marked the orders as delivered for me! But alas here is am with three violations and a banned account for simply doing what support told me to do. I've filed an appeal but they say it can take 14 days and that's a long time with no work. Maybe after all it is my fault for doing grubhub to begin with. It seems doordash and uber blocked ordering on military bases already. I wonder if GH ever will, or renew their contract to allow us to get base access!!!

1j959j0,post,"How Much Do You Make Per Delivery (On Average)? Do You Think It's Fair? Hi everyone. I'm a small youtuber who is making a video about why services like UberEats and GrubHub tend to be really expensive. In my research I've found that the delivery drivers really get the short end of the stick and that the company takes most of the profit.

I was wondering a few things:

- Is it true that the parent company kind of screws you over?

- How important is tipping to your livelihoods?

- Do you think it is worth all the effort you put in?

- What would be a better or more fair way to properly compensate delivery drivers for their time and work?

- How often do you believe you get a proper tip? 

- What is tip baiting and has it happened to you? And how do parents companies protect you from practices like tip baiting?

I'd be grateful for any and all answers. When making this video, I'm trying to be as transparent as possible and get information right from the source. 

Any other information you'd like to provide about your experience as a driver or how you're treated is also welcome.

I'm sorry if this isn't the right place to ask questions!

3. **How do you get the most tips out of your deliveries?**  I have been good about messaging updates in Doordash, but Grubhub doesn't seem to support in-app messaging the same way DD does.
4. Between Grubhub, Doordash, UberEats, and GoPuff: what's your order of preference? Are there other apps I don't know about?
5. What are the ""money hours?""  They seem to vary based on the day.
6. How do you make the grueling hours pass quicker?  The thankless work is starting to grind me down, and as the economy worsens, I worry that tipping culture will vanish.

1j3g7p5,post,"question for drivers/mini rant So I'm hoping this is an issue only in my area. but why do delivery drivers park in the handicap spot?

Is the 2 minute walk really worth your tires getting slashed or the ticket that comes with parking there? 

 i have seen a constant appearance of food delivery drivers who park in the handicap parking spots in the area i live (north of Los Angeles). They have no handicapped plaques or plates and i see then rushing in and out so my assumption is they are only doing it because its next to the door. Parking is tight here and having to maneuver a wheelchair from 4 rows back of cars just to go inside is not easy. 

  
I have a friend group who all talked and this is not just a me thing, 2 of the people in my group have already hit their limit and one of them has started slashing tires of delivery drivers in the handicap spot.

In my market GH is a distant 3rd and no one wants to drive for them.  The App sucks and Im constantly picking up food that has been sitting for an hour.

GH pays the same as the other 2, but my market is full of big tippers ordering shu-shu food fron shu-shu-foo-foo restaurants.

Thats fine with me.  I care not about the customer nor GH and as long as the situation remains the same I will do it.

Reason no one wants to do it here?  A downtown territory with 50 floor skyscrapers.  3 draw bridges that seem like they open hourly and a traffic nightmare I have never seen anywhere else.

So, I suck up the scraps and gladly do it.  2 months ago I was barely getting by.  Today all my bill are paid and there $125 in my savings (More to come).  If I can out up with this crap for 6 months my whole financial reality qill have been rearranged in a few short months.

So, keep up the crap GH.  Don't hire any more drivers and don't improve the app.  Keep things exactly they way they are.

1iwrlpj,post,"My food keeps getting stolen by the drivers with the same method I've had two orders stolen by different drivers within these last few weeks. I live in a building complex with an elevator, a guard, two automatic double-door entrances and security cameras.

I've seen the footage. The driver simply drops the bag on the floor between the two doors (after the first door, but before the locked intercom door). They take a picture of the bag on the ground and simultaneously ring the apartment number. Then, they immediately pickup the bag and walk back to their car.

I've contacted GrubHub and they said that without proof they won't do anything except refund or re-order for me. It takes me ages, if I'll even be successful, to get CCTV footage from my building's administration, and I'm afraid that at one point if this keeps happening, GrubHub won't refund me anymore thinking I'm some scammy user.

Anecdote:

I've read on other posts on this sub that drivers are ""hungry"" or that its tip/wage related (not that it's an excuse). Even if that were true, the foods that were stolen from me this splurge and also previous times were ""*sexy*"" foods like fast-food, fries, iced coffee, etc. When it's a vegetable soup you can bet they don't steal it. I assume someone who doesn't have daily access to food would rather steal something filling and with actual substance?

They're tied into the doordash system pretty good all they have to do is remake. Not so much with GrubHub. 

And so I called support and support canceled the order, I got paid a whole dollar.

1ivgstt,post,"How bad are your arrival times getting? Like how close can you get before arrival time on average? For some reason here in New Mexico, no matter the time of day, arrival times are always at most only 2 to 3 minutes longer than what Google maps says and that gap just evaporates on the way there from traffic and red lights to where I'm always a minute before or AFTER arrival time and mashing the arrived/retry/order is not ready menu a block away.

1ituyeu,post,"Wow!… and GrubHub only holds 6% of the market!!!! Uber Sues DoorDash Over Alleged Anti-Competitive Practices

Uber has filed a lawsuit against its food delivery competitor, DoorDash, accusing the company of anti-competitive tactics that inflate costs for both restaurants and customers. The complaint alleges that DoorDash makes it difficult and expensive for restaurants to partner with multiple delivery services, ultimately allowing it to charge higher fees while providing what Uber calls “lower-quality service.”

The lawsuit claims DoorDash’s dominance in the industry—holding 62.7% of the U.S. delivery market, compared to Uber Eats’ 25% and Grubhub’s 6.2%—gives it excessive power over restaurants. Some business owners reportedly feel pressured to stick with DoorDash, fearing financial consequences if they seek other delivery options.

In response, DoorDash dismissed Uber’s claims as “meritless,” asserting that its success comes from providing superior service. A 2024 mystery shopper study backs this up, ranking DoorDash highest in customer satisfaction, promotions, and delivery accuracy. The report also found DoorDash had the fastest average delivery time at 26 minutes and 24 seconds, while Grubhub averaged 35 minutes and 49 seconds, and Uber Eats lagged behind at 38 minutes and 4 seconds.

Despite ongoing concerns over high fees, the demand for third-party food delivery remains strong. DoorDash reported an 18% increase in orders year-over-year in Q3 2024, with revenue rising 25% to $2.7 billion. However, Uber hopes its lawsuit will force DoorDash to change its business practices, giving restaurants more freedom to choose their delivery partners without fear of retaliation.",Aggravating-Wrap1445,1740045061.0,2025-02-20 04:51:01,2025-02-20,04:51:01,16,0.94,34,https://www.reddit.com/r/grubhubdrivers/comments/1ituyeu/wow_and_grubhub_only_holds_6_of_the_market/,https://www.reddit.com/r/grubhubdrivers/comments/1ituyeu/wow_and_grubhub_only_holds_6_of_the_market/,True,,Wow!… and GrubHub only holds 6% of the market!!!!,new

I am in charge of ordering meals at my job and I use GrubHub for smaller orders. Multiple times I've gotten the same driver who, in the app, shows a feminine name and the picture is clearly a woman, but when they actually show up it's a man. The building is badge only so I have clear instructions to leave it outside the front door for a no contact delivery, but he insists on pulling on the doors and knocking until I come and meet him. We are the only ones in the building so there's no need to try to come inside. This morning I had an order and he was the driver again, and I did meet him at the door this time, but he refused to just hand the order to me and insisted on coming inside to take a picture. He hasn't really done anything else but I just feel a little uncomfortable that he keeps insisting entry (and that he's using a woman's profile).

1ipx99t,post,"Rude staff interaction at a curbside only place. Should I just let it go or maybe see if she continues to be nasty to me at the next pickup? Basically the curbside only place is laid out where it's in the middle of three other buildings at a strip mall kind of place where there's three blue painted parking spots technically just for them... But everybody uses a parking spots in the row around it just for them.

But today I got a storming pissed off bus girl stomping over to my passenger side window instead of my side to snap at me for not using one of the blue parking spaces that I could not see was open. And the staff that comes out always checks every single parking spot. So naturally I just park on one of the left slightly center spaces open.

It was also that kind of ranting person where like even if you're calm and say okay and sorry and it won't happen again they just keep going for you to do it next time... She was pissed because she said this causes the restaurant to not know we're here even though like I said, every other waiter there immediately checks every car that pulls in to that row when she claims they only check for the blue spaces... She was quite the rotund lady so I wondered if that was a factor...

They also usually go up to your driver window to talk and give you the food but she just kept coming to my passenger window, further getting angry because I reclosed it thinking she'd come to the driver side with the food... Then as soon as it's open again, and I reach for the bag with a polite ""Thank you."" she says nothing, gives me a dirty look and  reaches in and like does a SLAM DUNK DOWNWARD TOSS with the food bag into my open delivery bag resting in the passenger seat! Hilariously she didn't do it hard enough to do absolutely any damage to the styrofoam.

I yell back at her in a customer service ass kisser tone: ""Thank you! Sorry!"" and I get a loud ""DO YOUR JOB!!!"" That makes the people waiting in the other cars immediately look her way awkwardly.

1iozflh,post,"I think I've noticed that a Man Karen Diner that was probably removed from GrubHub is back on a different name. tl;dr - I recognized a problem customer from a long time ago is back on a different name and using the code drop off system. I keep hearing here that code drop-offs are either for new customers or problematic customers that always complain or get refunds?

\-----

Basically 2 years ago I had this problem Diner where it was a weird disheveled couple where every single time I dropped off an order they would meet me at the door and then follow me to my car while one of them inspects the food and every single time one of them would step in front of my car as they complain that absolutely every single time, something about their food was wrong. Then I would have to go through a song and dance every single time of showing them what GrubHub said was on the order and it was always completely wrong from what they said should be on there and they'd always like keep asking me what I'm going to do about it and I keep telling them to just call customer care because it's the restaurant's fault...

This lasted for about 6 months or so and I haven't gotten an order from them up until tonight... They did the exact same thing and I recognized the house just as I pulled in and the only reason I even took the order in the first place was because it was for a completely new name- a guy's name instead of a girl's name and also curiously they now have them for a code drop off instead of photo drop off... And they held the code hostage until we did our song and dance again because their Little Caesars green chili and cheese pizza daring to have green chili on it and not ""green PEPPERS"".

I can tell there's like something weird about them going on because they would just keep arguing circles with you until they got tired and went back in for 10 minutes or like they were obsessed with giving you a text saying there's a green pickup in their driveway and to deliver to the house of the green pickup then asking you once they meet you if you receive the text or not ""about the green pickup""... When their street address is just easy to get to on Google maps without their weird pickup truck directions.",[deleted],1739497285.0,2025-02-13 20:41:25,2025-02-13,20:41:25,4,0.7,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/grubhubdrivers/comments/1iozflh/i_think_ive_noticed_that_a_man_karen_diner_that/,https://www.reddit.com/r/grubhubdrivers/comments/1iozflh/i_think_ive_noticed_that_a_man_karen_diner_that/,True,,I think I've noticed that a Man Karen Diner that was probably removed from GrubHub is back on a different name.,new

Basically it's this dude at a Japanese restaurant where the owner is this very sweet lady and the other employees are just as friendly...

But unintentionally so this guy who's clearly the 20s son of the owner keeps basically micromanaging the hell out of How I come in and get food. Such as...

\* He has to get incredibly close to you while talking to him and does this even to people he waits on. Also I must Show him the offer on my phone and he has to get super close to the screen and examine it like it's a tax document.

\* He has to stack everything in a great big vertical tower in the bags, including soup bowls, but then turns around and orders me on how to carry them without spilling them even though I've been there like 190 times already.

\* Recently started calling me a few minutes after accepting offers to his restaurant if I'm not there on the exact time, asking where I am and if I know I even accepted an offer for his restaurant. This also happens a lot when people hot potato cheap offers in the time ​gets extended.

\* Whenever I have multiple orders to pick up. He absolutely must get close to me and go ""listen, listen, look here. (I literally have to look his way and at the receipts of the bags like I'm a child at school) This is bags for \[Diner A\], THIS is bags for \[Diner B\]! You go and you give food to both customers, understand...?"" In a hasty whispery tone... Confoundingly he even does this if I already have one diner's order and he hands me the next one 5 minutes later when it's ready...

What sucks is that this restaurant is really expensive so I get more than 12 bucks every single order even for cheapos ordering just a miso soup. Plus I get offers for this restaurant like sometimes 3 to at least once every day. ALSO I really hate that I'm speculating about this, but as somebody who has worked with people on the spectrum...

1iex5cv,post,"Question for Drivers I switched to GrubHub from UberEats about 6 months ago (got tired of missing food not being refunded) & I have had a massive issue with drivers leaving my food on the ground. I have contactless disabled (confirmed with support & in app) & have delivery instructions stating ""Do NOT leave food on ground. Please ring doorbell"". I would 90% of my orders are left on the ground & no doorbell ring to let me know the food is here. I also tip well & based on how far away it is as well as what time of day (traffic). However, I end up messaging support & having them remove the tip because the driver didn't do the job they were hired to do. I rarely had that issue with UberEats (maybe a dozen times over the course of 5 years). What is it about GrubHub that makes delivery drivers think it's OK to just drop the food on the dirty ground & leave?

ETA: wow, y'all certainly went full peak unemployable here. Instead of offering any kind of explanation as to why the experience is so different from other delivery services, you blamed the customer for the failure of the drivers to complete a simple task. I WAS feeling bad about dropping/nuking tips (why I wanted to know what was different) but not any more! If reading a few words & checking if 'contactless' is enabled is too much for you to handle, you might want to try unemployment. Thank you to the few of you who messaged me or responded like responsible adults. To the rest? May you forever be without tips.

1ie447n,post,"Confused - was this driver trying to scam me? Hey y’all. I’m not a Grubhub driver but am trying to understand something weird that happened tonight. I placed an order from a restaurant and then they called me to say their kitchen was closed and they’d cancel the order. Fine, no big deal, I placed an order from somewhere else.

They didn’t cancel the order, a driver was assigned, and he went to the restaurant. When I saw that I texted him and said hey sorry, they told me the kitchen is closed and they’d cancel the order, and now the app won’t let me cancel it so I can’t do anything on my end.

He ended up “picking up” the order, drove all the way to my house, sat out front for a minute and then marked it as dropped off with a blurry picture from the street of the bag of food from the second restaurant, which had already been delivered.

I thought at first he was trying to pocket the tip without making the delivery… except he drove all the way here anyway. Whether the kitchen somehow made the order after all or he faked the whole thing, I have no idea why he would have. Does this make sense to anyone?

I turn around and his order is gone.. turns out the neighbor took his order before he ever opened his door and before I ever made it back to the truck. What the fuck is wrong with people.

1ia7gnn,post,"Worst conditions you have encountered at a delivery I know there are some horror stories out there, but what is the one delivery that sticks with you for being particularly bad?

Up until tonight, the worst I had experienced  were some hard to find houses in the middle of the woods in areas without cell service (yes those exist in 2025 shockingly). A rude restaurant or customer or long waits. But I think tonight's tops anything I have had.   
  
About 3 miles into a 1 lane dirt road that was half plowed from the snow a week ago, I notice the road seems to be staying the same elevation but the houses appear to be getting higher and higher. I finally pull up to the address as the last house on the street, but cant see much of anything as theres no lights out. I take my flashlight out to survey the scene and nothing had been cleaned from the snow, street/driveway/walkway all packed down frozen solid ice. And thats just around their car. 

In front of that are about 30-40 stairs (no railings), same conditions, I'm wearing snowboots expecting this kind of stuff so I decide I will make the climb and I get to the top, and follow the path most walked, around the corner and up the stairs onto the deck, also, still nothing has been shoveled or cleaned or salted. The stairs are so caked with snow/ice that is almost a slide getting up and down. But when I reached the top, is when it takes an even worse turn... 

Ontop of the, snow/ice packed deck thats not clean, is crap. lots of it. dog crap. As If they tie their dog on the deck all day long and leave it there. I can only estimate 10+ piles littering the entire way between the stairs and the door. Upon seeing this. I dropped the food, took the photo with the crap visible, and sent a long text message after i slid down on my butt to my car (yes I actually did slip and fall at one point). I explained if they wanted better service in the future, turn lights on to help find the house especially if they refuse to provide a safe and sanitary environment to traverse to bring their food and that it posed a danger to even the fittest of drivers let alone those who may not be able to physically trek through those conditions.

Having delivered for UPS for a few years, I was tempted to leave the food on their car and just leave but was afraid of the consequences of that. I am still disgusted by this delivery hours later. So I turn it over to you lot. Whats your delivery horror story? Any advice for situations like this? Have you ever gotten flak for confronting a customer or restaurant?

1i9u294,post,"Hot delivery advice/etiquette I always turn off ""contactless delivery"" and put in the notes to ring the doorbell, because I'm hoping to get my food before it's cold or soggy. I can't blame a driver for a s***** restaurant or bad traffic, but leaving the food sitting outside without a heads up is under their control, right? They don't even have to hand it to me, just make sure they see me pick it up before they drive away. I'll assume you came as quickly as you could. 5-stars, good tip.

EVERYTIME, the driver leaves it on my steps without a knock or a doorbell ring.

I'm a GrubHub+ member living in a typical suburban house on a wide road near the highway. My door is ~30ft from the street with no steps or hazards. It's well lit. There's even room in the driveway if they want to pull in and save 15 steps.

I reliably tip 20% or more of the subtotal (before tax), and never less than $5 (like if it's a $8 sandwich, you're still getting $5 tip for your trouble even though that's 62.5%). I enter the tip at the time of purchase, and give good driver ratings unless something is missing from my order. I don't expect them to verify the toppings on a pizza or ingredients in a sandwich (because that's on the restaurant, but if the sandwich is missing entirely that feels like the driver should at least verify the # of items, right?

Am I doing something wrong? Is anything I am doing unreasonable?

Is there something else I can do to get a courtesy knock/ring when my food arrives?

If I'm not in the wrong here, should I reduce my tip or my review, or contact customer service?",TheGhostWithaMost,1737831344.0,2025-01-25 13:55:44,2025-01-25,13:55:44,5,0.86,34,https://www.reddit.com/r/grubhubdrivers/comments/1i9u294/hot_delivery_adviceetiquette/,https://www.reddit.com/r/grubhubdrivers/comments/1i9u294/hot_delivery_adviceetiquette/,True,,Hot delivery advice/etiquette,new

1i9hrpj,post,"Two digit code complaints I posted this as a reply on another post, but wanted to make my own as well so that I might get some more suggestions. 

I have a customer that I've been sent twice now. They live about 20 miles outside of my normal area, and they always have a 2 digit code. I get no response when I text them, and when I try to call I get a Verizon message saying the number is no longer in service. No one answers the door either, but the second time I did notice that they have an old school camcorder set up so it peeks out from behind their curtains and can see the whole porch and driveway. I wrote a note on a spare napkin I had in my car asking them to either update the number in the app or turn of the security code option. Oh, and of course they don't tip, either.

My bigger question is this: other than this customer, I've only had one other customer who i  couldn't get the code from. But each time, I can't just wait out the timer once, I have to wait like four or five times before it lets me mark the order complete. It lets me take a picture after the first time but won't give me the delivered slide until at least four times.

1i8zann,post,"New York City New Base Pay What’s happened is an absolute horror in my opinion. Starting Wednesday of this week, base pay in Manhattan has decreased to $3-$4 per order, mostly staying in the $3 range. This puts the app in a far worse position than DoorDash in Manhattan given that the Grubhub algorithm is horrendous and often sends you to pick up far from your current location. 

Are other drivers in NYC experiencing the same reduction in base pay?

Given heavy traffic of rush hour, it was nearly and hour before I got to my second customer.   

I sympathized, since GrubHub and Doordash have done this to me as a customer.  It's fine for some foods, that travel well, like pizza, but there are some foods that don't benefit from being in my car for over an hour, like French Fries.  

i would really like to tell customers to complain about delays, but I don't want to bad mouth a service that pays my bills, but customers deserve to receive their food in a timely manner.  

I should not have taken the order, but it was one of the best offers I had all day, and I couldn't resist.  

I was really surprised the customer didn't pull the tip.  I know that sometimes my ratings reflect GH and not me.  I did my best.

Second it got to be easily pronunciable name so people spread it around. grubhub fails in both things i didnt know what grubhub meant before somebody told me here grub means food, i thought maybe it meant hold something but that is spelled grab, most likely many people are like me they dont know what ""grub"" means so if you dont know word ""grub"" then grubhub doesnt make much sense. 
Secondly it is least smooth to pronounce grubhub  than ""doordash""  ""ubereats"".

However , when I goto restaurants to pick up for Ubereats I see tons of GrubHub Orders just sitting . Even if I’m waiting at a Popular restaurant I can see multiple GrubHub orders waiting and I still won’t get a ping.

I’m just curious how does GrubHub work for people mainly or only driving for GrubHub. It does not seem sustainable for me but I see multiple people on here in smaller markets making consistent money every day.

I live in the middle of a huge metro area and I can’t control random areas of hard hitting traffic no matter what time of the day it is. And it annoys me that there is no way to inform GH that there is actually heavy traffic and it’s not me being lazy.

Because of this, I have stopped doing dinner rush blocks between 5-7pm because my arrival time percentage gets killed every single time. The other day I couldn’t get for the restaurant on time because there was an accident and an ambulance blocking the road!

Does anyone have suggestions? I’m not multi-apping because I prefer GH: it actually keeps me in my “zone” while delivering and the pay is actually decent on most orders. I schedule blocks 4-5 times a week to work around my current full time job so I do the best I can.

For example, if they're out of M&Ms, and they put in an order for M&Ms on their ice cream, the entire order comes back an error and needs to be cancelled. 

Always I got 2 such orders this week, called support, and SUPPORT was the one that cancelled them after calling the restaurant to verify. 

I still got a violation for too many orders cancelled this week because there's an arbitrary threshold of 15% or more, and because it's been slow I haven't actually gotten many GH orders this week, so those 2 very legit cancellations that weren't even my fault are counted against me. 

Has anyone successfully had one removed because all the help info seems to suggest that it's not even an option to call and dispute them, so it seems like I'm just stuck dealing with a violation that isn't even my fault.

1hxyalq,post,"Violation for store closed? Twice in the last 7 days they gave me offers going to stores who were already closed and was outside their normal hours. Both times I took pictures of the hours and marked them as closed getting paid. I had no idea if the stores were open or not cause a lot of places change their hours all the time in my market. They gave me a violation for to many cancelations! How do I dispute this?? It’s not my fault they’re sending me offers to closed stores. 

Second violation in the last few months. The first was to many reassignments and now I’ve learned not accept orders unless I know I’ll complete them, but now I have to memorize all the merchants hours in my market?? What if I arrive at the store and the order isn’t in their system (this has happened to me before) will I be deactivated over things I have no control over..

Tbh makes me want to not even do grubhub untill the first violation falls off my account.

While the address on the application is correct, the ""Pin"" it drops for drivers to go to is way off. It takes drivers far too deep into the complex when I'm right at the front of it. 

The net result is that I end up having to watch my order like a hawk, and pray that the driver will respond to communication attempts, which half of them dont. 

I do have delivery drop off instructions that I edit all the time, trying for more/better clarity... But honestly? At this point I'm wondering if people are even reading it.

1huu09q,post,"Time to take action against the On Time Arrival at Merchant metric!!! I and many other drivers have been complaining to GH for almost two years, ever since they introduced this ridiculous on time arrival at merchant metric about the ridiculously short on time arrival at merchant metric, which is dragging all of us, who are working hard to maintain our premier level status.  Here is my plan of action.  On February 8 of this year, I am invited to a Ronald Reagan Birthday Dinner, where there will be prominent Indiana politicians, including the Lt Governor and some state representatives.  I will be calling for a law to be passed in the Indiana General Assembly that would outlaw the enforcement of such a metric for all trucking and delivery companies which would carry hefty fines of a significant percentage of a given companies net worth if they don't comply.  We cannot single out GH, it has to apply to all delivery and trucking companies.  I plan on also contacting the Teamster's Union to get the truckers on our side as it was the trucking companies that started this metric, causing truckers to get pay cuts for arriving late to pick up or drop off their loads.  I need some of you drivers to do the same in your respective states and maybe even try to get a Federal law passed.

  
1) Contact your state representative and state senator.  Let them know that an on time arrival metric is dangerous, as it promotes dangerous driving, running red lights, etc.

2) On time arrival metrics has caused truckers to drive erratically, making the interstates more dangerous for all .

3) It is only a matter of time for a delivery driver to have an accident due to on time arrival metrics, thus causing our insurance rates to go up.

  
Locate and contact your local truckers unions.  The truckers could be our best allies on this issue, and they have had to deal with these kinds of metrics for a long time, affecting their pay checks.

  
Look up attorneys in your area who advertise litigation of accidents caused by these kinds of metrics from trucking companies.

1huswyg,post,"Is it just me!?…Or are there other GH Delivery Drivers that have recently started getting the most absolutely INSULTING $$ Offers $$… (If any at all!?!?!?)  Ok so today marks my 3rd night in a row, that I rejected more offers than I delivered…. aaaaand it’s the WEEKEND!?!? Friday nights offers were all so low & far and few between, from 5pm -11pm I was only given 3offers all night and all 3offers were between $2-$4 dollars!?!? I ended up making NO deliveries because I refused to accept any of these 3 insulting offers! So I made NO money and was in the negative now for $ spent on gas… but it had to be a fluke, right!? Just a really BAD NIGHT!!!??? Right!? ….Soooo to my surprise,I couldn’t even believe how slow last night was. a SATURDAY Night, in Boston, MA… a major metropolitan city & a 24hour open market, I worked from 3:00pm to 11:30pm, hoping to make a little extra since Friday was so bad for me… But ended up getting screwed over a 2nd time & even worse, Not only did I only receive 5 delivery offers in those 8 1/2 hours, but to add insult to injury not even one offer was for more $6.!!!! My largest payment of the night being $5.84 for 2.9miles! Which I only accepted because I was getting desperate & I low key was hoping if I at least accepted something maybe the algorithm would send me more offers!? Or better offers!? ( which I now know was stupid, cause if you accept nothing for pay, then all they will offer you is nothing for pay!!!!!) Now I know some people will come at me saying $5.84 for 2.9miles isn’t a bad offer at all… But working in the city most of the time all my deliveries stay within .5-1.5miles of each other all night/shift! Typically (and depending on gas prices) I usually don’t accept any offers tht are less than $3 a mile minimum! My theory is tht I won’t accept any payment that doesn’t at the very least cover the price I pay for gas to drive that mile! Then to top off my weekend, tonight a SUNDAY, I worked 5pm-11pm and got, you ready for this… drumroll pleasssssse!!!!!….. “2”…. Yup u heard it TWO WHOLE OFFERS ALL NITE! I guess I should be grateful tht one offer for $6.75 because the first offer of the night I got was $2.14….. I’m just at a loss!!!! I really need the extra $ I was making w deliveries, but this is CRAZY!!! ….In Massachusetts Min. Wage is &15.75, so my offers and hours should at the very least equal out to that for pay per hour at the end of my shift! ( …ohhh and GH contribution pay wants NO part of having to pay is tht much, so on the very few times I didn’t make enough on my scheduled blocks and received GH contribution pay, by the end of tht week I’d be punished and have my scheduling restricted , I fought and appealed and won it back twice, but by the 3rd time it happened I didn’t feel it was even worth the fight, now I work when I want accept or reject what I want and I was happy and doing well until recently! I’ve been with GH for close to 2 years now & other than GH contribution pay screwing me out of scheduling blocks, I’ve been really happy working for them…  But now I just feel insulted… I know Wonder just bought GH out,I’m just really hoping this isn’t gonna be their standard… as long as drivers accept $2 offers tho, that’s what they’ll offer and that’s who they’ll pay!!!! I just feel defeated! Thanks for listening to my rant guys!!! Hope your weekends paid out better than mine!!! ( ….although I did keep seeing posts that people were unable to use Instant Cash Out at all today too…. Soooo first they insult us with their pay offers aaand then they don’t even allow you ur insulting pay!!! NICE!!!!! …..It just S-CKs cause GH really used to be such a great company to wrk for, of all the delivery apps they made u feel appreciated & valued!!! Now….

1hufzyq,post,"Location and deliveries I'm a regular doordasher that just started multi apping with GrubHub.

I can't help but notice, so many of the GrubHub offers don't seem to care about my location. I see offers for PICKUP that aren't close to me at all while the DELIVERY location is near me.... OR the pickup and delivery just aren't near me at all or even each other. 

With doordash (and Ubereats) you'll most often get a pickup that's at least near you with a delivery further away.

Is this just how it is or am i totally missing something? Are closer pickups saved for the more seasoned drivers?

The time that is given to get to many of these merchants is often times HIGH PRESSURE

I could be on the freeway and GrubHub will send me a order and give me 7 minutes to get to the merchant (traffic 🚦 weather accidents parking ) ...

GrubHub can send me an order which is located in the mall everybody knows about malls parking and navigating to the store or restaurant 

I'm doing my best ‼️💯

What are your thoughts about being on time to the merchant? 

PS. Then I get to the merchant and the food may not be ready for 20 minutes  

I don't mind waiting 👈🏾

1hr8jww,post,"New Year's resolution CA Obviously the company has done nothing about the tipping since the LA County counsel sued them over the tipping issue, deceptive customer practices, etc. We get the same ""benefits"" on GrubHub as we do on any other delivery app in California per Proposition 22. 

The $1.00 default tip is malicious and the line ""on top of driver benefits"" is VERY misleading .

So...

No tip= no thermal bag. knock and ring doorbell

$1.00= no thermal bag if more than 2 miles from restaurant. Ring doorbell

(Any notes re:doorbell or knock will be ignored or reversed)

We can't see the tip technically in the offer but we always know when it's a crap tip. Especially on longer trips. 

You've got to go out of your way to remove the tip so we return service in kind.

HOWEVER! during the time I was waiting to be approved, I had moved back to California. So when I tried to start delivering, it kept saying I was out of my market region. I’ve spoke to several GH care representatives. (HA! “cArE”) who I think need to find themselves a new name or new job because they definitelyyyyy don’t care about us at all. But after speaking to them, they told me I have to complete at least 20 deliveries in my region before applying to relocate and change my region. Indiana is 2000 miles away from California. That’s not happening. I’ve asked for supervisors I’ve asked for the legal department. I’ve asked for a one time override of the policy no exceptions they said. So my post is either too. I guess sell? my account? Lol do people do that? or find someone in Lafayette, Indiana that would be willing to do my 20 deliveries so I can apply for relocation.

1hnjky1,post,"Multiple orders Hi, newbie here! As I was picking up order 1 (pizza) they offered me an add on order (Chinese) which was right across the street, so I accepted it. I picked up the pizza and headed to grab the Chinese. The Chinese order wasn’t ready, they said it’d be 15 minutes. I waited the 15, then proceeded to deliver both. This was during a mission time frame, but due to the Chinese order being an extra 15 min wait, both orders were delivered after the mission time window ended. 
Could I have delivered the pizza then came back for the Chinese? I wasn’t sure if the app would let me do that. Also, if I had said the Chinese was late and skipped that order (I believe it gave me the option) would that have hurt my metrics?

1hmzmtv,post,"Scheduling Questions  So I have a question for all of you here. So I qualify for early scheduling and today (12/26) I manually scheduled myself for 3 blocks for this coming up Monday (12/30). I did so without realizing I actually have an appointment that day and I can’t work that day so I removed all 3 blocks immediately. 

I’ve never actually done this before so I called GH Driver Support to see if there would be any repercussions and the lady I spoke to basically made it seem like I royally screwed up. She told me that I may be punished for doing that and that my Schedule Commitment rating may plummet. I reminded her that on the app itself it says that we have 24hrs to delete an assigned block via availability when we’re given a schedule or 30mins to delete a block we manually gave ourselves from the time we assigned it. Keep in mind I dropped the 3 blocks literally 4mins after I manually assigned them to myself which is within the 30min time frame.

1hmiz5u,post,"Is this a glitch with contribution pay starting at midnight of a block that starts before midnight and ends after midnight? I usually do a block from 10:30 p.m. or 11:00 p.m. to 1:00 a.m. in my area. 

A lot of times earlier in the day I have nowhere near 100% acceptance rate which is required in order to get I think you have to have at least 90% in order to get contribution for any block in that day. 

However what I've noticed is if I schedule a block from before midnight that extends to past midnight, when I look at my acceptance rate for the day I have 100%. This makes sense because starting at midnight as long as I accepted anything that I received I would have 100% for that calendar day. 


But now I'm wondering when I get contribution pay for the whole block or just from midnight to 1:00 a.m. in this example? 

Knowing GrubHub as I do as we all do, I'm pretty sure I'm just going to get contribution pay for from midnight to 1:00 a.m. to fill in what I might not have made even though I made 20 bucks so they're not going to give me anything anyway. However I could be wrong and it might be a glitch or it might be on purpose, I could maybe receive contribution from 10: 30 p.m. to midnight, where I didn't make quite $12 an hour average.

1hjoz2q,post,"When a restaurant tells you that you are required to make the drinks for an order: The official answer is that not only are you not supposed to make the drinks but you're actually supposed to contact support because they consider that a refusal to fulfill the customers order.

Backstory: earlier this month I was picking up an order from a poke restaurant while the health inspector was doing their thing. I am familiar with the woman who was inspecting because I she inspected a restaurant I used to work at (we scored perfectly and she was really happy with us).

I ask her if they are passing and they kind of frown and shrug. They didn't pass and require reinspection this week. 

I accept an order today from the same restaurant which prompted me to Google their report and see the info I just provided. Poultry and fish kind of gross me out so I usually won't get it at a restaurant. So I go back to the counter when the order is ready and they hand me an empty cup for the order but I have no drinks listed. 

I took notice of this whole situation because I had 3 orders in a row that required me to return after leaving to get the bags that they forget to give me. It happens but I should have stopped giving them the benefit of a doubt sooner.

That got me thinking, we should see if there is a connection between businesses making us fulfill drinks and bad scores on health inspections. The reports are public and usually available right after inspection. I also took notice that this restaurant did not have their health inspection report posted anywhere visible inside of the restaurant, that was another red flag.

I know this was a point of contention earlier today in a post, i feel a lot of drinks I'm not trying to make anyone's day worse. But if this is a consistent thing that it may be smart to actually insist that the employees prepare the drinks. I would hate to be responsible for somebody getting sick, I know I would never find out if I did. I also feel like it's only right to let people in your community know if that restaurant is not up to the minimum standard of your local health inspectors office.

I'm new to GH and haven't used the app much since I was approved because I find this appalling. I have completed 1 delivery in the last 1.5 months. I have been active on Uber Eats and also DoorDash with over 600 deliveries now and have been comparing them and looking at other options.  It seems all of these gig options give a driver plenty of reasons to not like them.  

I keep getting a message to enable ""precise location"".   I have it enabled while using the GH app yet it keeps popping up and blocking me from maneuvering in the app.  I figure out if I enabled tracking all the time, it works fine.  I contacted GH support 4x and they had me do the usual - clear my history on my phone, cookies, check available storage, remove and download the app again. It works for a minute, then the ""allow for precise location"" pops up again and blocks me from doing anything.

I called the driver and he struggled to speak English, at one point he just spoke to a translator app and said something along the lines of ""I'm sorry, there's nothing I can do it's what the restaurant gave me""

Long story short I gave him $7 for me to have to go and pick my own food up anyway because he took the bag and didn't check or confirm anything.

Meanwhile DoorDash and uber operate 24/7 with atleast half a dozen available merchants at any hour of the day.

There is a little cesars ONE MILE FROM MY HOUSE! I call myself ordering a pizza for the family. And i place an average $3 tip thinking (okay  its not a giant tip. But $3 plus base pay for 2 miles to deliver a pizza to a guy who cant get it himself cuz he has kids should be EASY fast money) RIGHT????.

But nope come to find out they send the order to the location a good 12 miles from my house…
first off WHY? Pizza will be cold and theres a spot A MILE AWAY!?!?
Anyways of course i dont realize this until i check wondering whats taking so long. And below and behold the driver is driving in the opposite direction (clearly about to give me the middle finger and swipe my food)

And of course he ends up swiping it so i havw to call and get the tip removed and report him. But i feel horrible because I WOULD HAVW UPPED THE TIP AFTER DELIVERY HAD I KNOWN….

For several months, I've had a customer where they live in a specific apartment complex that for some damn reason, if you put the address for it in Google maps, It takes you to some empty lot 2 miles away between houses that's clearly not even the street it says it is. 

The only way it works is if you put in just the name of the apartment complex... But eventually even that led you to the empty lot. And it was really sad because the customer is really polite and I know her by name by now.

Also it's one of those apartment complexes where before it started fucking up, it showed her location at just the front entrance to the complex and when you got to her specific building you were too far away from the house icon and it wouldn't let you mark arrived without threatening you.

Also directions around that part of town seem to be wonky in general, because I got another frequent customer where Google maps keeps wanting me to drive down this alleyway too thin for a car with two pillars on either end to make it so you can't drive through it...

1h7u2qw,post,"Lying customers Does it do any good to call GH after someone receives their order and then lies and said they didn’t? I had this drunk guy put in the wrong address. He texted me saying it wasn’t at his door, and I was still there so I sent him a photo of the order at the address listed, building number and apartment number. He then comes over from wherever they actually live, saying that there are two of the exact same building and apartment numbers. Spoiler alert, there is not. I went and looked. 
But I put this guy’s order in his hands. I told him I think he just put in the wrong address, because there’s no way there are two of the exact same address in the same complex. This is a gated apartment complex where I had to use a code. If I had been at the wrong complex, I wouldn’t have even been able to get in. 
I immediately get a notification when I get back in my car, that the order was canceled and not to deliver it. Yes, I still got paid. But it just pisses me off that this guy gets to be a dick to me about his mistake and then turn around and get free food. Would it do any good to call GH and explain to them what happened?

1h7tcdb,post,"Grubhub > DoorDash in Atlanta Georgia? First impressions I have been a Doordash driver in atlanta for quite some time now on the side despite having multiple other jobs to support income , i primarily work on the east side because nobody has any money on the west side or they're just stingy idk but westside is always like 2$ orders so i dont go there. I finally got accepted onto grubhub after like.. a 5-7 month wait and i didnt try it out for a while, but doordash was frustrating me today because of the high traffic volume and the chik-fil-a deliveries where the wait times were like 45 min to pick up (not doing that for your 6$ order), so i decided to head over to my grubhub zone and take some orders there.

 As soon as i started. 17$ order for 6 miles!!! I took it, dropped it off and the new area i had headed too didnt have much traffic at all!! The lady who ordered was super sweet, not even my best doordash customers are that nice here. Before i even left her driveway, i got another order!! 15$ for 8 miles, I took it, picked up, then i dropped it off and immediately got another one for 10$, only 3 miles. I ditched doordash entirely today bc the highest offer i ever got was 12$ for 15 miles. I did grubhub for about 5 hours and i made a total of 117$ in the sandy springs-duluth zone.. i like the fact that grubhub allows you to route multiple deliveries everytime a new one pops up which is a pretty frequent thing, the customers were all nicer and it took me mostly to suburbs with easy to locate houses. doordash in my typical zone tends to only take me to apartments, hospitals or the sketchiest addresses in the hood. i struggled to ever make 100$ in an 8 hour shift with doordash, but today i averaged 23$ an hour and there were lots of orders that i did not accept because i was busy doing other things like eating my lunch and stopping at bathrooms lmao. I never got a single order that was under 1$ per mile. My only complaints is the apps UI, its kind of ugly?? harder to navigate than the doordash app, you have to click way too many buttons just to complete each step and i think it, you also dont really get deliveries past 10PM, this is definitely a day time app, doordash might be better at night, but im up early anyways so i dont mind.

 Im not sure if this will remain consistent throughout time, but i only spent around 15$ on gas today and didnt get a singular order for under 10$ the entire night, the wait times were even less than doordash which surprised me because everyone has told me grubhub wasnt good for them.. but they're also doing areas like cobb county which on doordash was only paying around 2.50-5$ on orders for high mileage and you just end up declining the majority of them. So far though i very much enjoyed the shift and im looking forward to giving it another go tmrw.

1h5bgmp,post,"You Should Actively Promote Non-Tipping Currently it doesn't seem like Grubhub is in touch with reality or how to run a business.  A common saying is ""no-tip, no delivery.""  And that's the way it should be, as their delivery + service fee is often $20 and drivers don't see anywhere near enough of that.

  
Therefore, you should encourage people to order from their site and tip $0 dollars, every single time.  Anytime an order doesn't get delivered, it's Grubhub who eats the cost and loses.  If enough people realize that tipping is an absolute scam, then we drivers will either get paid properly for our deliveries, or they'll remove and/or significantly reduce the delivery + service fees to actually allow the customer to properly tip.

  
This strategy is a win for all four parties involved, the customers, the restaurants, the drivers, and Grubhub.  Granted, it's a big short-term loss for Grubhub, but if they hope to stay in this business they'll allow their drivers to make more deliveries, get the money they deserve, and make the useless fees for the customer either useful or go away.

Is there a reason the app says the driver is on the way to me when they're clearly making other deliveries? I always tip well, because I'm tipping in a manor of: ""this person is picking up the order I just placed and bringing it to me"" when in reality, they're picking up several orders and making several deliveries. With mine almost always getting delivered within ~3 mins of the maximum threshold. All ice melted, food essentially cold. This restaurant is 6 minutes away and it took 36 minutes for my food to get here after getting picked up. 

Unfortunately I'm just not gonna tip anymore, use GH or have that tip be significantly diminished. 

Is this a common issue as I'm sure drivers get most of the blame?

Edit: too funny. I hope you clowns don't wonder why people don't tip you losers. I'm not sure what's funnier either, the reddit echo chamber or a bunch of people who's zero skill jobs will be replaced first by robots and AI, in a reddit echo chmaber

Do the people who run the company know how to hire an app developer?  Someone to maintain and test the app to make sure it works on even the smallest, simplest level?  
Do they have a budget of a few thousand dollars to pay someone to have a look at it and make it actually send notifications to drivers?  Notifications that drivers can see and hear instead of the invisible, silent, background notifications that it only tells us about after the fact?  
It seems like someone there ought to want to make sure that the company's only tool for making money isn't a broken, useless failure.  I've just never seen evidence of such a thing.

1gzputn,post,"Finally happened, block scheduling blocked. So a while back I saw someone mention that they got blocked for not having any orders after being scheduled on a block for 3 hours.

I wasn't sure if this would happen to me, but it did. My account history has not one single order denied, I took everything. Everything.

So if you are curious, yes, even someone who accepts every single order can be blocked from scheduling because they went a scheduled time without any orders coming in from Grubhub.

Grubhub does not care if you have 100% acceptance rate over the career of your time with Grubhub. If you go a scheduled block and do not get orders, they will block your ability to schedule blocks.

Some people may say I was stupid for taking every order. I was being paid hourly, so I did not reject any orders. For me, this was just a side gig for extra money, and I enjoyed it. That's why I did it. I will not be doing it anymore. I wish you all well, and hope you all are successful with the future of Grubhub.

Additional information: I was not sitting at home waiting for orders. I was parked at the local mall which has several restaurants around the area that are typically sent all of our orders. The only hotspot we had was a single restaurant about 20 miles over, which usually did not get any orders. There's no guarantee that orders will arrive once you get to a hotspot.

If you are on a scheduled block and you are not getting orders, you might want to reach out to support to let them know you're not getting any orders. This may prevent the automated system from flagging you for 'abusing' the system.

Grubhub is dead in my area, so I think I'm gonna take this as my queue to get out of rideshare platforms. I wish you guys well!

1gzol8t,post,Schedule Hey quick question i worked a schedule from 9.19am-10.30am and only made 8.54. How long until the time adjusts the pay. New to scheduling always had to just turn it on and see what I get. If I'm correct which I might not be that should be about 10.50ish so would they cover the difference.

1gvszdd,post,"Well, it's official....I got deactivated. No idea why. 

Back story: got a message in app on 7/29 asking me to upload my photo ID. I did exactly as requested. Tried logging in several days later, and got a message stating that my document was under review, but my deadline to submit was 7/31, and the system would not let me log in. Probably 15 phone calls, multiple emails to support, and multiple in app service requests later, still no progress. Finally around the middle of Spetember I sent another email to driver support and this time I copied the CEO in. Email was very professionally worded and simply askwd for some sort of update as to why the document review was takimg so long and why nobody could or would tell me what the delay was. Still nothing. Sent another in October, and copied in the CEO and the VP of driver relations, asking the same questions. Still nothing. Applied using a different email and phone number, and got put on the waitlist for my area. Assumed that the reason my login was inactive was because they had too many drivers, and that when they opened things back up, my login would be reactivated, and that they were using the ID verification as a tool to weed out some drivers in the meantime. Got a text yesterday saying they were taking new drivers in my area, and I was able to continue the application process. Tried my old login....still nothing. Started the application under my new email and phone number, and when I got to the page where I entered my DOB and SSN, I got a message stating that they would not move forward with my application and thanking me for my interest. 

What a chickenshit way of deactivating drivers. I had zero complaints, a decent AR, and a completion rate well over 90%. No idea why they pulled the plug. Don't really miss them, since they were the least busy of the 3 food delivery apps and I also had Roadie and Shippd and some other non-food delivery apps that I did. I stay busy without them on the nights I run. All I ever wanted was an explanation of what was going on....never got one. 

Not surprised that they just sold for a 90% discount...it sounds like the slowdown locally was reflective of a national trend.

The transaction is expected to close early next year, at which time Grubhub will officially join Wonder. Until then, we’re as focused as ever on supporting you and achieving our shared goals. Stay tuned for more details about this exciting time!

Grubhub Delivery Partner Team""

Pictures of attention to the two words ""Until then,"", meaning they're not going to support us once the takeover is complete. 

You could mean that.

""Wonder is a fast-growing, food-tech startup that's raising the bar on the role food plays in peoples' lives. We're a team of food-lovers, entrepreneurs, and some of the most accomplished innovators in the culinary, logistics, and technology industries""

I checked out the Wonder carrier app 500 downloads and no reviews yet on the Android platform. I suspect that those are all beta testers. I'm assuming that under courier is something for package pickup and delivery and you have to go to some kind of a designated package pickup place in order to accomplish that kind of like puff puff or whatever the hell that was did you get on Uber eats sometimes. 

Is that what it's called? Puff puff? It's been a while. 

So hoping that's not their food delivery system because I don't know what the hell HDR means but I'm imagining it's Headquarters Driver Receiving? 

From looks at the app it's almost like it's got a Caviar feel to it.

It also seems like a company that doordash would buy.

Anyway was only $500 downloads that's brand new app. 

They're based in New york, so get ready for that nonsense.

I noticed it when I ordered for myself.  GH sent the driver to a Starbucks two miles away.  That wasn't bad enough.  The Starbucks they send drivers to is on an insanely busy street, it is in a construction zone and very difficult to get in and out of.  Every time I get a Starbucks order it's to that one.  The street is so busy, I feel like I am in danger every time I go there between 7 and 11 in the morning.  

When I ordered for myself, I was very puzzled because there is literally a Starbucks I could have walked to, but the driver goes two miles away.  There are six Starbucks closer.  Okay, i didn't go myself, because I was on the fritz, and I didn't feel like I should go out.  

And it's not just GH, it's DoorDash as well, they send me to this particular Starbucks.  Are they getting kickbacks?  

I was thinking I could get a little harness for my dog and train her to go to Starbucks for me.  But, seriously why don't these services send drivers to the closest store?  I told a customer how far GH sent me to a Burger King where there was one in her neighborhood, around the corner from her.

1gl7ozt,post,"Ghost orders So I haven't gotten a ghost order in months, but I also haven't gotten the new timer offer interface for two months, finally got that yesterday with the 4.98 update. Today, I got my first ghost order in months, and I'm furious, because it made the ring tone, went to look at it and it disapeared, and of course it then blocks you with a bullshit screen that you can't get out of that takes up the whole fucking app, telling me that i ""missed 2 orders"" (even though it was just one order), and if I'm still available. There's two options here, select ""im here' or 'unavailable'. Selecting 'im here' just reloads the same stupid ass screen message, so if you were to get another order during this time, you'd miss it cause it takes over the entire app. So to get out of that obnoxious screen message, you have to quickly select unavailable and reload the app and hit available (so it's green). It took at least a good 2 minutes for the app to penalize me of course, dropped my 100% acceptance rate to 67%, thus me losing my contribution pay for the day and today has been slow, so getting that to 100% ain't happening. 6 hours' worth of contribution will be gone, basically. I'm so fucking sick of this pos app. I even have my sht set to unrestricted on my phone and i thought that was the cure months ago since i haven't gotten a bs ghost order signal glitch since then. But nooo. It's clearly the app, and the unrestricted setting in battery for androids, clearly isn't going to stop this problem with the latest app update. I'm so irritated with this fcking app lol.

1gl07fh,post,"Did you ever get an order cowbell and going to the app and not see the order? It happens a lot. I don't know why it happens.

We all know what it looks like, that orange banner at the top that has the word view on it and you click the word view, then you see the order. 

First of all, it's a superfluous, unnecessary, ridiculous banner. When we hear the order cowbell and pee open the app, we should just see the owner screen, am I right? 

Anyway, when you hear the order cowbell, like Pavlov's dog we open the app, and then you don't see the orange banner. What you do? What can you do? 

Maybe I'm stupid, but accidentally clicked on the part of the screen or the upper right hand corner which it looks to me like a hand holding a star. 

I clicked on that while hearing the order cowbell, and the order screen came up, the new water screen with the reject button in the upper right hand corner and the sliding timer purple button at the bottom that says accept on it but the countdown timer counting down. 

The dollars offered in the miles total miles it'll take to complete the trip. 

Under the several more times after uninstalling and reinstalling the app three times in a row. 

The orange Manor sometimes appears and sometimes doesn't, but there's an orange banner the hand with the star icon is covered up, 

If there's no orange banner, just click on the little hand with holding the star, and you will see the order. 

Again more ridiculous nonsense why should we have to click anything to see the order once we're in the app, while hearing the cowbell to bring us from the pasture to the trough?",DanLoFat,1730904556.0,2024-11-06 09:49:16,2024-11-06,09:49:16,3,0.67,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/grubhubdrivers/comments/1gl07fh/did_you_ever_get_an_order_cowbell_and_going_to/,https://www.reddit.com/r/grubhubdrivers/comments/1gl07fh/did_you_ever_get_an_order_cowbell_and_going_to/,True,,Did you ever get an order cowbell and going to the app and not see the order?,top_year

1gkauop,post,"Question for Drivers about tip scams. I recently placed an order from a local restaurant that is a 2-3 minute drive from my house and got a text message from my driver that said, ""The order is delayed and is going to take a very long time. Can you increase my tip?""

The order was delivered well before the estimated time on the app (this place is very fast and nearby, which is why I chose it), and I never got any follow-up message.

Fortunately for me, I did not actually see the text message until after the delivery was made because I had my notifications off during a remote meeting, so I never responded or took any action.

Is this a common thing for drivers to do? Should I report on the app? Does the app UI from the driver's perspective make it easy to accidently message the wrong person? I'm wondering if this is an intentional scam or possibly a misdelivered text?

Another question: should I actually schedule myself or just make myself available? Does it hurt my rating or is rating not such a big deal? I'm already on DD and I make sure to keep my rating high. I'm using GH as an experiment because I was told I could earn more on GH. Now I'm not so sure.

1gf03ch,post,"Open Letter to Rob DelaCruz, VP and Gen Mgr, Onsite with Grubhub Dear Mr DelaCruz,
    My wife has worked for your company for 2 days. In that time, she has racked up several ""violations"" that were not her fault. We live near Jacksonville, NC, home to Camp Lejeune. She cannot get on base with out a CAC card, or filling out a visitors day pass and completing a background check every day. Furthermore, the base ""addresses"" don't register in Maps. ""Company B 227 BN"" doesn't reflect a street address, or even a geolocation in order to meet the customer at the gate. 
    We tried calling customer service, and informing them, but they were less than helpful. Their suggestion was to simply not take the order if she couldn't deliver it. HOWEVER, there's no way to see the address until you accept the order. Also there is no ""undeliverable to address"" option on the ""problems"" menu. 
    She is a good driver, and loves the job, but is so frustrated she's going to quit. 
     I'm sure she's not the only one. 
     Camp Lejeune is the largest Marine base on the east coast, covering 156,000 acres and over 120,000 personnel.  That's a huge local market share your company is missing out on, due to this problem of base access.

1ge552r,post,"Places You Won’t Go? Last week I was given an order for a restaurant (not a chain) and then on my way there I was given another order for the same place, about $23 in total and not that far for delivery.   I get to the restaurant (I was finishing a different delivery) and I tell the person behind the counter “Hi, I’m GrubHub here with orders for Brad and Marc” (not their real names).   The employee then tells me “Well, Marc is going to be about 24 minutes and Brad still has 8 minutes.  So do you want to just cancel one and do the other one first?”   I told them that they’re delivering near each other, which is why GrubHub put them together.   The employee then says “Other drivers will just cancel one and come back.  If we wait, then one of the orders will be cold and we’ll have to hear from Door Dash about how the food quality isn’t good”.  And I’m just thinking about how that’s not my problem and they should figure out a better method of operating or not partner with GrubHub but unlike this person I am not there to tell them how to do their job.   So I canceled both orders on my end- told GrubHub the wait time was too long- and if they give me that place again I won’t go back there.   

The two funny things of this are: I was in a block (I don’t do blocks any more) and ended up at a place where I waited literally 30 minutes for the food but couldn’t just leave because of the block deal but that’s another place I won’t go back and it’s in the same plaza as the restaurant above.  I also went down the road and got Thai food which I drove around for like a half an hour because I dropped wings off along the way.  So I mean, even if I don’t take two orders and they’re made so far apart, I still could’ve taken one order from that restaurant, picked up something else and then their order could’ve been just as late (like the Thai food). But, again, I’m not here to tell restaurants how to operate and from what I’ve read online people say that the staff at this restaurant are generally rude.  

Will GH know not to send me back there?  Do they learn?   I’ve been rejecting offers under $5 and I feel like they’re sending them to me less.

1gcp4f9,post,"Stop working for these people It's not going to get better. The only way to change it is to stop it. All I see here daily are people coping with the bullshit the gig apps do. They'll never get what they deserve because of naive people and humans in general not listening to warnings.

Few Ideas I've had to disrupt GH/JustEats

* A picked up order app - Produces false proof so you can steal food from GH
* An app that Auto Logs you into gh - to prevent deactivation
* Auto off/on  - a feature that would turn of and on your delivery status when receiving a bad order, this prevents GH from putting you in TimeOut for too long
* Steal Food - You don't even have to work for GH.  I could make another app that generates order info quickly to look like a legit order. It would be just as easy to fool them with an image (this is the reason for the app, so they can press a button and it looks legit) but some have caught on.

Thing is I don't have any energy to think about this company anymore. So much so I've been deactivated for inactivity and they won't reactivate me (probably based on past behavior of me not accepting literally everything and blowing my car up). So deuces. If I think of anything else to make GH worse for everyone I'll let you know.",cantloginviagoodle,1729960660.0,2024-10-26 12:37:40,2024-10-26,12:37:40,0,0.2,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/grubhubdrivers/comments/1gcp4f9/stop_working_for_these_people/,https://www.reddit.com/r/grubhubdrivers/comments/1gcp4f9/stop_working_for_these_people/,True,,Stop working for these people,controversial_year

1g70ndr,post,"40 min to make $2 I accepted an order to drive 2 miles and make $4. So I though okay that's not far that's fine. First I waited for the order 15 minutes. No big deal, they were busy on a Friday night. 

Then I drive the 2 miles to the area. Doesn't seem too complicated, except for when the map said I was there, only the address could not be found. The street was only like three blocks long, so I went up and down a few times. Finally, I get back to the spot the map swears is it and stop and call the customer.  

Customer said ""what street are you on, what's around you?"" So I explained what the neighboring houses were like and how the addresses all lined up except hers. As in the addresses were all 141...and hers was apparently 140...but the street ended at a 141.. address. 

Then she said ""well I don't see anyone outside my house"" Well yeah because I can't find it. That is literally the point. She gave me a vague direction by saying there's a certain car outside the house. And mentioned how a lot of drivers have a hard time finding it.

So I drove around again looking for the car. Nothing. At this point it's been about 30 min or so. I call support and they put me on hold to call the customer. Who doesn't answer the phone. Now if it were me and I knew my delivery driver was lost I'd answer the phone. 

At that point, after two calls, the support person cancelled the order and I got $2. Ten minutes later my phone rings and it's the customer calling through support to ask where I am....um at this point I am back home because that whole thing annoyed me. 

I'm sure they are complaining to someone about how I stole their food. The irony is, it was cold and food I wouldn't eat anyway. 

I can always find the house. I've been driving since way before google maps. I know how addresses work. Maybe they should write out some actual directions next time.

1g5s397,post,"Am I Misunderstanding GH Contribution? So on Tuesday I worked blocks from 11:00 am until 6:00 pm.  I went available early, I went unavailable a little after 6 and stayed available the entire time.  I stayed within my region and had a 100% acceptance rate.  

At the end of the day, I had made $80 and change in total but the GrubHub side of that was only $39.96.   (The rest was in tips). I was under the impression that the GrubHub side would then correct itself to being $70, as I’d be getting $10/hr for being in a block.  That means GrubHub should’ve given me another $30.04 or am I misunderstanding how this works?

I also must admit that I a) took an order for around $4 which had me driving way too far because the customer didn’t tip (I would have ignored it if I wasn’t in the block going for the 100%) and I also was doing nothing from 3:30-4:30pm because there were simply no orders.  If I wasn’t in a block I would have gone unavailable but I felt tied down to being in the block.  

This whole thing has really soured my idea about blocks because I feel like I didn’t get my guaranteed pay as I understood it to be and I also felt like I’d be getting more orders when I also sat from 12-12:30 and had none. 

While I realize not every day can be the same, in contrast the prior Tuesday I went out from noon until 6- a whole hour less- and made around $100 and I wasn’t in a block. I also went unavailable for about an hour or so during that time to go to Goodwill.   

I see a lot of discussion with people on both sides of the fence about blocks and based on my one day using them I don’t think they’re worth being tied down.  The best part of this job is that you can just go unavailable if the day sucks or you get diarrhea or something.  But when you’re in a block, that can’t happen.  So, for me, even if GrubHub gave me that $30, I’d only had made $10 more than last Tuesday when I wasn’t available for as long and wasn’t in blocks.   

But am I understanding blocks correctly in the way that they are based on the GrubHub pay and don’t include tips or is it that I made $80 on the day with tips and that’s more than $70 so GrubHub kicks in nothing?

1g36m8r,post,"Thinking about driving part time I'm not sure exactly why, but reddit started showing me posts from food delivery app groups. It got me thinking...

Long story short, I just took a new WFH role at my current employer that is salary and partially tied up in quarterly bonuses, and even though it should be roughly the same as my old hourly position at the end of the year, the day to day pay is lower. 

So I'm considering doing some food delivery a few nights a week to pad the ol' checking account. At least until I can catch up with with a couple or few bonuses. 

Is it worth doing this as a part time, probably short term gig with the understanding that I don't need to make a living at it? I live on the edge of a city with a large-ish population and plenty of participating restaurants. I have a new vehicle that gets 23-25 mpg. Gas prices are around $2.75/gal.

I broke two screen protectors, just this last week…

The chick I talked to at customer service, multi apps for Diver don’t Care, I’m sure!

All she could do is not-search my questions and read the script and ask me if I was ready to make that purchase…

1fq6qk8,post,"I think I figured out why my ID documents have taken 8 weeks and counting to get reapproved. Last week of July, got a message in the app (while I was on a delivery!) asking me to submit photos of the front and back of my ID. Thought that was weird, since my license was nowhere near expiring, but sent them anyway. Tried logging in 4 or 5 days later, and got a message that my documents were under review and it should be a couple.of days but the due date was 7/31. I couldn't get past that screen. Called support, got scripted, can't connect to that group, we'll start a ticket, can't elevate to a manager, just have to wait. Countless phone calls, emails (even including the CEO and Chief Experience Officer!), and online help requests later, we're at 8 weeks and counting of no progress (or even an acknowledgement that the issue exists). 

So today I decided to try to create a new account. Lo and behold, drivers are waitlisted in my area! 

Looks like the ID thing was just a way to cull the herd of existing drivers....I had noticed that the number and quality of GH orders had dropped off dramatically before all this happened (I normally have  GH, UE and DD all going at once, plus Roadie and Shipt), and GH might have sent me 2-4 orders over the course of a 5pm-10pm shift (off block). I'm guessing they approved way too many people at the same time their market share locally started dropping. Good thing the other 2 apps seem to be doing well.....I really haven't seen any appreciable revenue impact from getting relegated, but it would be nice to still have that arrow in my quiver.

1foiwea,post,"BS violation for “not delivering orders”. Hey everyone! My friend made a Reddit account to post here but couldn’t because she’s new lol and asked me to do a post for her. Soo, here it is! 
TLDR; Being flagged for not delivering orders but not true. 

“I'm new to grubhub. My very first delivery last Thursday, the lady gave me the wrong address to the hotel she was staying at. I delivered it to the wrong hotel and then got a text from her saying it wasn't delivered properly. I apologized and went back for it and told her I was on my way to drop it off at the correct hotel. She was completely understanding and apologized for giving me the wrong info. 5-10 minutes after she acknowledged my message that I was on my way, I got a notification that she cancelled the order and to not deliver the item. Y'all know how it prompts you to not deliver if an order is cancelled. So I kept it and then continued to my next pick up.

Yesterday, I had a lady place two separate orders at the same restaurant. I thought maybe it was an accident because it was the same exact item. I picked them both up and delivered. At first, I delivered to the wrong building in her community. When I submitted the photos, she called me immediately and directed me where to go. She met me outside and I hand delivered the order to her, but I was unable to submit a photo because I had already done so. About 10 minutes later I got a notification that both those orders were cancelled.

I'm assuming this is the reason I have a violation but can anyone explain to me why?  The app quite literally won’t allow you to deliver if you are at the wrong address based on the GPS so it’s complete bullshit. I called customer service and of course they were no help. I was told the violation will fall off after 90 days. But I don't want this to be a reoccurring issue and possibly get more false violations and then my account gets deactivated. Anyone experience this as well? Any suggestions on what to do to prevent this from happening again?”",Ok_Cup4567,1727200757.0,2024-09-24 13:59:17,2024-09-24,13:59:17,1,0.6,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/grubhubdrivers/comments/1foiwea/bs_violation_for_not_delivering_orders/,https://www.reddit.com/r/grubhubdrivers/comments/1foiwea/bs_violation_for_not_delivering_orders/,True,,BS violation for “not delivering orders”.,controversial_year

I just accepted this order on my way back to my area after delivering another one outside of my area. I take 94 which is out of the way from my area, but in the direction of the restaurant of course. 

I am half way there and I see the order was canceled.

1fmtofo,post,"Why GRUBHUB is so unprofessional ( or are they ) ? - No wonder they can't pay the Drivers appropriately after losing money everyday... Did 4 orders yesterday. Was Multi-apping with Shipt.

I could mark ARRIVED for 3 of them. Surprisingly the MALL ( pretzels ) order ( $11+ for 7 miles ) did not allow me to do so??? - tried moving around the restaurant in the MALL but no avail.

Restaurant did not have the order. She took my phone & completed the order.

Kept on getting crappy ' You are almost there - blah blah blah'

So after picking up - called GH - she apologized in broken English...

And while I was talking to her and about to start driving to the customer, GH UNASSIGNED me because I didn't move to the restaurant???

Ended up with a ton of Auntie Ann's Pretzels which I am not a fan of... and NO PAY for all the efforts - like parking far away due to unavailabity, walking back & forth to the car, waiting because restaurant didn't have the order & finally interacting with GH support.

Also Arrival/Completion ratings got trashed ( I don't care anyways being a partner - lol ) - but if it happens frequently then VIOLATIONS or even DECATIVATION could come into play...

On the other hand - GH lost money because they Trust Customers 100% - no matter what - So instant refund... GH doesn't investigate FOOD NOT RECEIVED claims as well - just refund because its DRIVERS' fault 100%  - they are BAD PEOPLE and can never be TRUSTED... 

They have to be penalized DAY IN & DAY OUT - NO MATTER WHAT ...

They lose ton of money on their unprofessionalism everyday  - so what is the solution to recover lost money ? -  CUT THE DRIVER PAY...

To be fair to GH - I made big money in the past with GH and still love GH ( not as much though ) and I sincerely hope I am wrong...

1fmbu3l,post,"Out of retirement posting to say, ""worse fear happened"" dog attacked me.  Currently things are still in the process of being handled. Even Grubhub is currently investigating the incident. 

What happened:
I was delivering a customers order which was a cherry slurpee and a box of pocky. I get to their house and notice there dog was very aggressive. I'm talking pushing the vinyl gate outwards. I see this and proceed to text the customer the macro, I've arrived. The gate opens up and I'm standing there with the order thinking ""maybe the dog is put away."" Dead wrong. Flying out of the gate is a large German shepherd. Proceeds to go after me gets my hand, elbow, side and lastly my leg. I fall to the ground. As the dog barely gets to my leg. A teenager who lives there pulled the dog off and took them inside. Apologized for it and I got off lucky. 

The dog barely did any significant damage my hand hurts a little bit. So did my side and left shoulder from the fall. Currently, I have reported it to the local animal control, I'm awaiting a incident report number to file a police report. I did let Grubhub know and I'm not doing any more deliveries to that house. I'm also awaiting to hear back from them as far as their investigation. They sent an email asking for all the information. Including the medication I received in the urgent care. I do plan to go as far as possible with this. I know it's an accident and apparently as the customer said ""my brother is in a wheel chair and opened the gate."" I don't know how true that is. Figured I'd post this for the sake that it might be helpful. 

Especially since I was on Grubhub's time and they have accident insurance. I'm curious how this is going to go. I told my Mom I'm going to be pissed. If they send me a $100 gift card. If that. I'm sure I'm getting a ""oh we're sorry for the inconvenience that happened to you."" 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤬🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬",Mcgoo186,1726949725.0,2024-09-21 16:15:25,2024-09-21,16:15:25,4,0.67,19,https://www.reddit.com/r/grubhubdrivers/comments/1fmbu3l/out_of_retirement_posting_to_say_worse_fear/,https://www.reddit.com/r/grubhubdrivers/comments/1fmbu3l/out_of_retirement_posting_to_say_worse_fear/,True,,"Out of retirement posting to say, ""worse fear happened"" dog attacked me.

However, today, all my order offers have been the old orange rectangle 'view order' bar that was at the top of the app screen everytime. I am seeing the old offer ui not the new one, today, since my first offer around 9am. I'm like wtf. 

After I'm done with my shifts today I'm going to uninstall the app and reinstall and HOPEFULLY that fixes it, cause I don't even dare try to to view order and wait because the old timer was awful (felt like 2-5 seconds, if that), and then you ""miss"" the order, so it's not worth risking but yesterday i didn't have to do anything, the big green accept ui and timer would show me everything I needed to know, and now that's gone, reverted back to the old one. I'm concerned because A) it sucks to be on the old one), and B ) I'm not seeing anyone else mentioning this problem. Not a single post. That's not good lol.

1fjzypf,post,"GH vs DD opinions?  Been doing GH for about a month now and just started DD today. I'm curious what everyone's opinions are on the differences. 

GH I like because I can throw it on whenever I want to earn a few bucks. So far with DD it seems to be on a per need basis. I can't just start it and go. It either needs to be busy or I have to schedule. It also stopped me when the area I was delivering in was no longer busy. I do have more choices with DD as far as area though if I want to travel around my state.

So far with DD I haven't received any double orders or got any orders when I'm in the middle of a delivery, which means I'm sitting around waiting more or chasing hot spots. But I haven't received any lowball orders yet like I seem to get a lot of with GH. Everything has been over $1/mile.

The interface for GH seems a lot quicker on my phone. Loading everything up is almost instant where DD takes 5-10 seconds to load up. I do like that the navigation is built right into the app instead of bouncing between the two with GH. 

So I'm curious what everyone's opinions are. Do you find it worth it to go between the two or do you stick with one or the other? Do you find one tends to pay better? Also, for those with experience using DD, am I better getting paid by the order or by time?

After I didn't get paid, I called them again. While speaking with the rep, I noticed that my bank account number was changed that day I got that complaint.

1ffuytp,post,"Got a double order where Order A was ready and the manager asked me to go deliver it and come back for B because sushi. Asked driver care to Mark order A delivered and she marks order B delivered instead and then tried to turn around and say it was my fault. Got two orders simultaneously for a local sushi place. Molina and Sabrina. Molina ordered just two raw fish rolls ready and already waiting for pickup, while Sabrina's was a big dinner and would take 25 minutes.

The manager walks out and asks me nicely if I can go please deliver Melina's order first since she's a 3-minute drive away and back and because it's raw fish. So I get to Melina's house and I find the new format of the app doesn't let me prematurely Mark one order as delivered or even take a picture...

So I get on the phone with driver care with of course the THICKEST Hindi accent person I've encountered on this job yet... While driving back to the sushi place I explained to her that I already delivered to \*​Molina\* and that I'm going back to wait for Sabrina's order. I repeated about three times that it was Molina that was done. DC lady kept being confused and asking if I wanted to unassign an order, or the diner or the restaurant wanted to cancel, or that I couldn't complete Sabrina's order. All while both chickens and a baby crying loudly were in the background on her end. 

By the time I was in the parking lot she said she finally got it and that she would mark the order as delivered... She marked​ Sabrina's order instead after I told her four times emphasizing ""MOLIna is delivered!""...

I tell her she marked the wrong orders delivered and I was going to deliver that order and that I told her multiple times that it was the other order... She's deathly quiet aside from her baby and chickens for a long time... Then asks if I was trying to prematurely mark an order de​livered without completing it. I just replied back that I know these calls are being recorded and that I told her that she marked the wrong order as delivered... and she just hangs up.f

I finally have to call driver care immediately again while I'm being sent to another order to a KFC and Burger King. This time it's a Hindi accented guy who knows his stuff and it's just as flabbergasted as I am and says that he has my previous driver care collar on record and will make a complaint and that he also canceled Sabrina's order so it doesn't look like I stole it...

1fdqwl8,post,"Straw That Broke The Camel's Back Today I got an order from Pei Wei. It was 19 or so miles for $17 (a rare double digit paying order for my area) so I accepted. I noticed that the delivery address was less than a mile from another Pei Wei location. Said fuck it and while I was waiting for them to bag everything up I got a $6 add on for 0 miles. Apparently it was a duplicate of the first order. I accepted cause another $6 is always welcome. After they finished making the second order I noticed I wasn't able to mark the add on as picked up so when I got in the car I called support. They told me to proceed with the delivery and to call after it's delivered so they could mark them as delivered. 

After dropping them off I called and as I'm on the phone they canceled the add on and I didn't get paid for it. Support said the system recognized it as a duplicate (nearly 40 minutes later after I had already dropped it off) and canceled it. I fought them on it. They told me to submit the request form through the app. I have no proof of the add on since it doesn't show up in my orders tab due to it being canceled.

1fdlqa3,post,"20 deliveries in 14 days to go from Entry Level To Partner? I contacted Grubhub support, and they informed me that my stats are not updating because I haven’t completed 20 deliveries within 14 days.

I initially thought this meant 20 deliveries in total. This is very difficult to achieve, as in my market they rarely send me any deliveries, and the ones they do send are often poor. The most I’ve managed is 6 deliveries in a weekend, and even then, I was pushing myself to reach a total of 20, since most of the deliveries were terrible.

This expectation from Grubhub is so unrealistic, especially given the low volume of orders they offer.

I can't even get this done, because even if I take all the bad orders I'm not even sure they will send me enough to get 20 done in 14 days.

It should be 20 deliveries in total, not within 14 days.

Been doing DD and UE for almost a year now, finally got off the waitlist for GH and did my fist shift today. Already think it's worse than the other two. Rejected 39 out of 41, most of which were high miles going out of my area. DD is where I make most of my money and UE is just a filler for when DD is slow. I guess GH will also just be a filler. The things I already dislike about GH:

  
1. Can't pause the app. Just seen in the app that when you're on a scheduled block you can only take one 10 minute break every 2 hours. Hell no, I am an independent contractor, not an employee, you ain't telling me when I can and can't take a break.

  
2. Stacked orders. I see GH has gone the way DD. 90% of the offers they sent me were stacked and some of the pick-ups and/or drop-offs weren't even close to each other. At least DD and UE keeps them pretty close together.

  
3. Getting offers while driving to a drop-off. GH opens the map app when navigating and I missed a bunch of offers because I couldn't navigate back to the GH app to view them. I ain't trying to do all that while I'm driving.

  
4. Offers going out of my zone. I live in a big college city. On DD and UE if I get a good paying order to one of the smaller towns outside the city I can usually catch an order from one of the mom and pop restaurants going back to the city. With GH I would have to drive back to my zone before receiving any more offers, meaning a lot of dead drive back. It would have to be really high paying for me to that.

I remember a fast food type place say they are busy and it will be ready in 8 minutes. But when I place the exact same order I get it in around 2 minutes what’s up with that?

But at least GH didn’t auto unassign when I decided to wait until my arrival is around ETA otherwise I would had been be really angry. Anyone done this before?

It’s interesting I noticed that after GH reinstated my blocks after years of hiatus, I noticed something interesting, my market is pretty dead anyways though most of orders I get seem to be late night or early morning otherwise I pretty much get nothing. So I log on at night around 9 and schedule 11-1am as well as 5:00-7:00 or 8:00 am and I did log off to sleep between 1 - 5am however I still get kicked off at ten even though I had 4 hours off two are closed hours anyways between 9 pm and ten am.  Thus only 8 online hour in total keep in mind zero time actually worked and I didn’t schedule blocks at night. It appears with blocks they count all the hours starting from going online doesn’t matter one logged off or the market closed in between for two hours.

I am thinking they programmed the policy this way to punish cherry pickers. It appears only Uber actually interpret to the full letter of drive time not idle time. 

GH seem to count online time to the ten hour cap doesn’t matter whether one receives any jobs let alone accepted and worked the job. So when orders finally comes one gets cut off by log in hours limit. Alas GH is the only one that is getting orders at all DD almost nothing these days.

1f9g5ny,post,"Getting it out of my chest  I worked at driver care and driver payment for GrubHub a couple of years ago, and I have always wanted to make a post about this. 

Firstly, I want to point out something obvious but still needed; as this was a couple years ago,, I am not 100% sure if things are still the same, but knowing corporate, they probably are. 

Now, I am not sure on how to start this, but basically, and without the intend of being harsh, you guys should value yourself more and fight for better work conditions. 

I consider myself someone really empathic, and to be honest it was complicated having to deal with a job where you are suposed to support, but you are really not helping at all even if you want to. Most helpful stuff you could do was getting the restaurant to remake an order lmao. Driver care is there 50% of the times to deal with driver's complains. 

The majority, if not all, of the of the processes that are followed by customer and driver support are driven towards retaining the customer at all costs. It is stupidly insane the amount of money that these guys are willing to spend just to retain the customer when they have a ""bad"" experience. 

For example, if a customer got their order cancelled, they would get a $10-$20 coupon, while you guys literally did not even got paid for going to the restaurant or driving crazy amounts of time. Like, I am not saying customers should not be compensated when that stuff happen, but they can easily do a $5-$10 each, but they just don't.  

When I was at driver payment, 95% of my work was denying payments for canceled orders, mileage adjustments, etc. We almost never did any adjustment, and if we did it was $1 tops. My advise is, don't event lose your time and energy with trying to get a pay adjustment for an order lol 

Also, corporate and the higher ups have really no idea of what the actual fuck is going on or what are you guys experiencing there in the field. I remember being called for meetings to kind of keep them posted and it was hard for them to understand some stuff because they were clearly not interested in knowing what is really going on.

Summing up, don't forget that you guys are who is keeping the company running, not the customers, nor the clowns in suits that are there just scratching their asses. You guys are doing the deliveres, you are dealing with the traffic, customers, annoying restaurant employees, etc. They are nothing without you, and if you guys trully organize, you could fuck them up or at least get better conditions. 

I know changing the way thing works is hard, but in the meantime, do not get crazy about your rates and just take whatever orders you feel like and that will make your day easier while redituable. Most of the times you won't get paid more if you do what they want you to, and the benefits are minimal.

Something else that I would like to add is that,, I know most of you all are tired and having a tough day when you pick up the phone and call driver care, but don't forget that the guy or girl on the phone is algo a human trying to do their job, and probably while having a shitty day too, so be kind. 

Finally, I just want to thank you all for everything. Of course that I don't know anyone in the sub, and no one will recognize me, but I am sure that I must have worked with at least one of you guys, and I hope I made your day easier back then, even if you do not know or remember me.

1f8y0f5,post,"What’s the purpose of scheduling blocks these days, and how GH calculates CA prop 22 time limits. Interesting as it appears nowadays they don’t compensate for complete lack of orders anymore during a block period as unlike in the past it’s not possible to take advantage of Blocks pay doing low demand times when GH might not send  any orders. I remember any order not taken would wipe out any chance of GH compensation anyways.

I be curious what is the purpose of having blocks these days anyways especially in markets with minimum pay for active time anyways. Does it give order priority? As it’s very slow these days as people are fed up with high fees for worse quality service.

I remember back in 2019 on a slow night they send me a low paying order 20 miles one way away which I turned down that night close to end of shift they took away all GHC for that day. That was back when they paid GHC if all orders were taken which including if GH didn’t send an order throughout the block.

calculates active hours and or moving more than 10 miles per hour while looking for ride requests or orders as the prop 22 language does say “logged in and driving” I noticed GH tends to calculate anytime logged in as well as scheduled on blocks regardless one actually worked or driven at all either logged on or on block. It appears there strategy to interpret prop 22 this way is to get cherry pickers off line. Nowadays blocks are only available late night or early mornings anyways.

One more is Larry... he tries ordering food with PRECISE amounts of random sauces that are always way too much for the meal he orders. He apparently lives in a Motel 6, because the first time I thought he was just a cheap ass tourist but I keep getting offers for him every year.

The weirdly most egregious one is Steven because the first two times I did his order he lives in a duplex and looks just like Harry Knowles and he comes out to get his food and acts all polite but him and his premises always reeks of marijuana and he is always visibly high.

1f4jig7,post,"What’s the deal with Grubhub’s OWYA and its history? If appears nowadays it’s only for shop and pay orders

Fortunately unpartnered restaurants are out due to the mormetarium on violating unpartnered restaurants menu copyrights.

They joined the OWYA card fad right before lockdown abruptly. 

It appears for Postmates and DoorDash originally when they started they had the card as standard payment procedure as automated tablet payment haven’t been rolled out yet across all their partners yet so it was a bandage solution. Though eventually they find it an idea to get to deliver non participating restaurant orders. 
It appears GH started later and only after partnering with restaurants long before they had deliveries thus they didn’t have card initially. 

I still remember one restaurant getting mad at me for calling in a OwYA order instead of ordering at counter, that place had a super long line at that time just because they saw the card . I immediately cancelled after they became aggressive towards me. Yet they stilled called me every 15 minutes to try remind me to pickup and pay but I had to insist it’s not my order, I eventually had to block their number.

1f4ha5w,post,"Guaranteed Pay Is A Scam!  I've been driving for GH for almost 4 years now in Hickory, NC which isn't a huge city like Charlotte, but it's a pretty decent sized area and I used to average around $120 (I know that's not a lot in larger markets but around here it's pretty good) in an 6-hour shift. I've only a couple of times had to take the guarantee pay. Today I was on a scheduled block from 7am-12pm and by 11 I'd had one total order for $13.76 which itself is strange because Thursdays are usually extremely busy. Another order showed up for a new restaurant I'd never heard of which I accepted, hit navigate, and headed to the location. When I got there I switched back to the app and the order was gone. I looked in my order history to see if it was cancelled and it now showed it as a missed order. I called driver care, the agent I spoke to said that he could see that I had accepted it but that it had been reassigned for some reason almost immediately after I accepted and said it must have been a glitch in the system and that he'd get it fixed so that the missed order would be taken off of my history. Fast forward to this evening I go check my history because I'm still getting no orders even though I'm available and sitting in a large hot zone (yes I know they're BS) and the order has been put back on my history and my acceptance for the day is now at 50%. I called driver care back and the agent I spoke with said that she couldn't fix it. I asked to speak to her supervisor because I could hear them in the background coaching her on what to say, to which she blatantly lied and said the supervisors are in a meeting for 2 hours and to call back then. This stuff is getting out of hand. How are we supposed to be out here making money but they can't bother to give us the orders? I went to three of my regular restaurants just now and they said they've got all kinds of GrubHub orders in and nobody coming to pick them up. How are we supposed to go pick them up if we're not getting the orders make this make sense to me.

1f3u5qp,post,"Have you ever had any stories of really nasty or just bad driver care calls? Like where the person was being weirdly unprofessional or straight up lying to you or just acting like a robot and reciting every canned response with no original thought? Did a CVS grocery order delivery for $19, but the store had all the pills in weird places with different prices. I called driver care because none of the barcodes worked for the item the guy wanted or his substitutes. But at every single moment, this power tripping asshole went into a blatantly canned phrase of ""So are you saying that you are unable to complete this order, because that gives me grounds to unassign this order with a penalty!"" In a very accusatory and oddly monotone voice like he was a cop pulling me over and reading options for my ticket or my Miranda Rights.

Like it sounded like he does this at every call possible so he can hang up as fast as possible, because the first time he did that he went straight for it in the middle of my explanation of what was wrong.

I just kept trying to keep defusing him from doing that about three times in a row while he had absolutely no idea how the shopping menu even worked; like he didn't know there could be substitutions or that I was scanning barcodes. All I needed him to basically do was ​finagle the menu back because I found the original item and it wouldn't let me go back and say I did. ""So are you saying that you have messed up the app by your own fault? Because if you have, I have grounds to unassign this order with penalty!?""

I finally got mad and told him not to do anything, I'll just press ""submit item anyway"" then he cut me off asking ""So you are saying you're committing fraud by attempting to purchase the wrong item with your driver card!?""

1f3lv4z,post,"Grubhub sending orders far away from customers without them realizing it There is a restaurant  I always order from just a mile from my house. I assume that’s where I was ordering since previous orders came from there. Today I placed my lunch order and it showed on the map my order coming from a location in a different city which I know is about a half an hour away in traffic. I feel bad because my tip is based on the mile-away location, and I also don’t want to eat cold food. The grub hub won’t cancel despite my immediately trying to cancel when I noticed this.  I just wanted to point out that when drivers see orders that don't make sense, it could be that the customers don't even realize where Grubhub is routing their orders.  I thought I was being nice for leaving a $8 tip on a $16 order from 1 mile from my house, and now it's an 8 dollar tip to deliver from a different city in rush hour traffic which could be a half hour of driving one way and I'm getting screwed because GH won't cancel it.   Multiple drivers accepted the order and later canceled it despite waiting some time.  The delivery estimate is 1.5 hours from when I placed the order.

I get to the restaurant and they said the customer picked it up. I was like WHAT?

I chatted with support and they said they would contact the customer and don't hit got order or leaving (as usual). Then they cane back and said to mark the order as fulfilled. I said I don't believe that I can do that. (Fulfilled?) 

I exited the chat and hit got order and leaving and try to mark it as delivered but couldn't of course.

They ended up marking the order as delivered and I got full pay?!?  Not complaining but just strange. I expected the order get canceled and get screwed on payment.

The GPS takes me to the first building on my left and the apartment number is 201.  It’s pitch black outside and the lighting is very poor so I can actually see the number on the building but it’s where the GPS lead me so I assume it’s the right place. The door is open so no one needs to ring me up and I leave the food at apartment 201 and take a picture and complete the delivery.  

10 minutes later I get a call from the diner saying they never got their food and they know the picture wasn’t their door because they don’t have a welcome mat. They demanded I come back and retrieve the food from the wrong address and give it to them at the correct address. I politely tell them that I’m already on another delivery and that I can’t go back and get food that has already been sitting out somewhere for 10 minutes. They angrily tell me that they’re going to file a complaint against me with Grubhub. 5 minutes later I get a notification that the order has been cancelled.

My first order of the day doesn't show up anywhere. It's as if it doesn't exist, and as you all know, Skip's chat and email support can be a hassle. I don't know what to do. It was a $22 order, and it bothers me that it's nowhere to be found. (Obviously, I've learned my lesson and will always take a screenshot from now on).

My second issue is that after that, I continued delivering, and from the rest of the money I earned today, only $7 is available for cashout. At least this amount shows up in the statement, so I hope it will appear in my weekly statement. But after the first order disappeared, I'm not sure what to think.

I just received my third violation. All three violations, they stated are for ""High number of reassignments"". I looked back at the dates for the  three violations, via the  emails for daily and weekly summaries. The first violation I had 3 orders removed with penalty in the period of 8 total days, my second violation I had 4 orders removed with penalty for a period of 8 total days, and my third violation I had 2 orders removed with penalty in a period of 7 total days. In those orders removed with penalty at least 4 to 5 of those I tried to click on the tab, ""having issues with order"" to let them know I was running late or I was having car issues but it continued to just remove the order with penalty. I then called two or three different times to  customer service to let them know what was going on. So maybe they could help me, so i wasnt having orders removed with penalty. But they just proceeded to tell me, to do what I had already tried to do in the app myself. They didnt listen to anything i told them. So all the orders that were removed with the penalties, were due to the same issue I was having car issues, a tire  that was going very low or almost flat numerous times. So there were  times where I had taken an order and then I had to pull over and put air in my tire very quickly, because it was low and I would have ended up with worse issues if I hadn't stop quickly. In every instance my delay was probably around 5 minutes or less and the longest delay still being under 10 minutes. Sorry for the long post.

1eyjsmx,post,"My $20 cash tip guy let me down… I’ve spoken about this customer before - he’s prepared to cash tip $5, $10, or $20 cash, completely dependent upon the level of service 

Did you get lost, is your attitude good, food handling, etc

I’ve always gotten the $20

I got a run to his place, Saturday night, and GH decides to jam a second offer in front of him

I assumed he’d be okay, texted him to let him know… no usual “hey great, thanks” or whatever 

When I dropped off his food, he met me out front as usual, but with very little interaction took his food and walked away 

No tip

At all 

I think I might have actually stood there blinking for a long time 

There was a clear message here

“When I order first, I want to be first”

And he’s entitled to that

Was he wrong to punish me, this way? Not completely  

He has every right in the world to use his money to influence the service he’s provided 

And I had a choice - accept or decline the second offer - plain and simple 

How will I do it in the future? 

I’ll have to decide which pieces of this puzzle have what “value”

Starting with my stats, are they worth twenty bucks? For me, no

Is this customer’s satisfaction, and twenty bucks, worth more than my stats? Not sure…

Is this customer’s satisfaction and twenty bucks, worth more than my stats AND the other $12 offer? No, hard no!

His twenty dollars worth of bargaining power just dwindled to $8…

I have to work way harder than $8, and way more than $20, too… to repair the damage from a single rejection 

Sometimes I don’t get a tip

1exv3v9,post,"wondering legitimacy so I’ve been driving for GrubHub for almost 7 months and never really had an issue recently. This restaurant had an attitude with me because I did not wait for the food when they wouldn’t even tell me how long the wait. time was the next time I went into the restaurant. They decided to get short and say I’m not giving you the order my friend then after he does that he refused. 

To give it to me so I called the customer letting them know so they can understand what the delay is, and I tried calling GrubHub with no result. I don’t understand how these restaurants can do that to withholding the order from them. if they did not want me back at the establishment, they should’ve told GrubHub not to send me here. They have that ability on their tablet or even on the computer logging into their merchant account. 

but to the point, I’m still on hold after the weekend so Saturday was the original report got put on hold for false complaint that was not true saying I was harassing and refusing to leave the restaurant  it was a hot day that day so they weren’t giving me the order. I stood my own little corner. at least to be in the AC when doing the calls I had to do. all this is on body cam showing that I did nothing wrong. I do have a body cam that proves if there’s any false accusations that arise. 

I showed them the information and they gave me my account back in less than eight hours but the main problem they decided the next day to put my account on hold again and since then when they did it on Sunday, putting it on hold again they claim have a photo well as written evidence against me as opposed to the first support, same date and all

But again clearly, my body cam footage shows that I’ve been professional trying to find out a solution to a problem and now I have no way to reach anybody and when I call on the phone, they say they don’t handle it and it’s a specialized team.

1exac1i,post,"Does my driver get penalized if I report missing items? 

Hey drivers! I've never had anything but excellent Grubhub drivers—effecient, on time, friendly & follow instructions for delivery. I try to tip accordingly, minimum 
25%, or higher if it's weird hours, includes awkward drinks, soup, frozen items etc.

That said, recently I've received a series of deliveries that were missing items or included an item significantly wrong from what I ordered. 

All of my deliveries were ""safety sealed"" and would have been by no fault of the driver.

Will I negatively impact the driver If I submit an order for partial refund for the incorrect/missing items? I hesitate to submit these requests in case they affect the driver, because I KNOW it's not the driver's fault. They'd have no way of looking inside closed/sealed orders to check if an item is correct or missing. 

I don't like paying for items I didn't receive or didn't order, but even more, I hate the idea of the already-underpaid driver being penalized for something they can't control.

This is not the norm. 90% of the time my order is correct and gets here with zero issues—but the last three orders I placed at different restaurants were either missing an item completely or significantly different from the order I placed (e.g. ordered biscuits and gravy but received no gravy).

Does my refund or partial refund affect the driver's pay/tip/rating?

1evgujm,post,"Schedule Commitment rating - how does it work...? I've been chatting with support about this to no avail.  I'm hoping one of you has better insights.

I'm a recently reactivated driver.  I managed to get a few blocks scheduled. (apparently its quite the feeding frenzy when they become available) 

one day before my first block, I thought I would accept orders only to find I was arbitrarily deactivated pending my 4th ID verification.  

When my first scheduled block rolled around a day later, my identity verification was still pending, so I was still unable to accept orders.  To be clear, I was ready and able to drive, but the app wouldn't allow me to take orders.  I even tried going active just to see if I could and the app stopped me cold.

Yesterday I was finally able to take orders and drove for a few hours through dinner service.  

This morning I checked my stats, and my schedule commitment rating is at 54%  I presume this is because I missed a scheduled block, because my ID needed to be verified.  

Now I have little to no access to scheduling, so how am I supposed to improve my Commitment Rating?

I'm trying to make a common sense appeal that the missed block should not have counted against my commitment because I had already been through Identity Verification 3 times prior and this was unnecessary.  It had been a few years since I drove for GH and I don't remember it being this complicated.",GenXJoe,1724007331.0,2024-08-18 14:55:31,2024-08-18,14:55:31,2,1.0,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/grubhubdrivers/comments/1evgujm/schedule_commitment_rating_how_does_it_work/,https://www.reddit.com/r/grubhubdrivers/comments/1evgujm/schedule_commitment_rating_how_does_it_work/,True,,Schedule Commitment rating - how does it work...?,search_missing

However my on time rating fell to 78%, but I figured out that I needed to hit arrived when I was close enough before parking. So I went out yesterday and made a few on-time pickups to get rate back up. Today, when I checked my stats, my on-time rate is indeed now at 81%, but my schedule commitment is now at 0%, even tho I didn't have any scheduled blocks and haven't dropped any future blocks.  I don't understand how my schedule commitment rating went from 100% to 0%. All I can think of is that I only took 3 orders and only drove for about 1 hour.

That happened to me in February but I was able to get them back, but you need to do it a certain way. Just responding to their emails doesn't work since they don't reply to emails going to that address. 

What you need to do is as follows. Submit a request [here](https://driver-support.grubhub.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=360001426972).

Select ""Delivery Partners Request Form"" then scroll down the page to select a topic and choose ""I have delivered a GrubHub order"" then ""Scheduling"" then ""I received an email with Scheduling Restricted in the Subject Line"". When they email you back with their automated BS then reply to that email and ask them to either explain what you did wrong or reactivate you. Don't be jerky about it either, I assume that might help.

That's what got them back for me. I also  just helped someone on this sub that had been trying to get them back for a while that hadn't tried this method.

1es8yg2,post,"Question about refunds as a consumer Delivery drivers of all kinds regularly screw up my delivery address.  I live on a busy street so I imagine they just go to the street behind my house because it's easier to park / their GPS may even take them there.  But while my dwelling is attached to the building on that street, it is a completely different apartment on a different street with a different address and I don't have a key into their lobby.  My door has a completely different house number than the door(s) I've found my orders at.  My delivery instructions explicitly state 

> ""Red door with number ""###"" on it - if the door does not have ""###"" then it is the not the correct address.""

However I'd wager that about 1 in 4 orders is delivered wrong.  I always get a refund when this happens regardless of whether or not I am ultimately able to find my food (which I often am, but definitely not always) - because I do not pay for GrubHub+, delivery fees, and tip to have to walk around looking for the food I ordered.  I pay for those things to have the food delivered directly to the address on my order.  I don't want to screw over people so I'm wondering if I should just delete GrubHub altogether.

I'm wondering though - how does this impact drivers?  GrubHub pretty much always refunds me no matter what - do the drivers lose their tip or anything?

You absolutely cant keep it at 100% if you live in a city where there's more than three people at a traffic light. If you live in the suburbs without a lot of traffic, maybe it's possible? 

Nobody in Houston has a 100% on time. I had like an 85% on time and accepted an order the other day. I was already at this restaurant. I'm not talking about driving past it or being on the other side of the parking lot, i was  literally standing directly inside the fucking restaurant. I was picking up an Uber order. 

I had this food in under 30 seconds. I dropped this off 1.5 miles away and my completion percentage immediately went down .

I think what they're doing is keeping the clock running on another driver that dropped it.. maybe another just dropped it within 5 minutes of me picking it up but the clock was still running?

1ellqh2,post,"How to get notification of delivery When I order from Grub Hub I turn off contactless delivery and put in the delivery instructions for the driver to knock on the door and that my doorbell is broken. My hope is that at the very least, I will be alerted to the food being dropped off at my house if not having it actually handed to me.

However, I would say, in the last 6 times I've ordered 4 or 5 times the food has been left on the doorstep and the driver has just left resulting in the food sitting anywhere from 15 min to an hour and me getting cold food. Yes, I am partially to blame as I should be more vigilant, but sometimes I get wrapped up in doing something and lose track of time.

Is it asking too much to have the driver knock on my front door, give me a phone call, or simply send me a text notifying me the food has arrived? As a former food delivery driver myself, I always tip north of 20%, but now I'm rethinking it to not tipping or setting up a cash tip to require interaction for the driver to receive their tip.

They found a way to screw me over by doing this. 

So today on my one hour block that was $18 dollars. I  was sent a 3 dollar order and a 5 dollar order that took 40 minutes.  Then they sent a high mileage order that wasn't even ready when I got to the restaurant.

By the time I drove to pick up the order and had to wait...they sent two more orders because I did not accept the first because my block was ending  literally three minutes later. 

WHY TF. are yall sending orders that require an additional 40 minutes to deliver when my block is ending three minutes later. 

That is 9 dollars a f in hour... basically. 

Why are drivers putting up with this mess.

1ek0fn2,post,"Anyone else getting shitted on while being premier?  So I’ve been driving for Grubhub almost two years and I’ve only been driving as a premier driver since march of this year. This last July was the worst month I’ve ever had. The first week of July started out fine. Normal I would say. Then i didn’t drive the next week(I lost premier) then I drove a little to get it back and when I did my hours have been cut back severely. Before I always put in for 44 hours a week and always got them, but the last three weeks have seen my hours cut in half. Next week I was given only 14.5 hours, despite blocks being available that I wasn’t given on two days. 

I took screenshots to verify my claims. Anyone else getting shafted like this? I think it’s ironic that the next day after getting my reduced schedule they sent me a email with my stats and my AR was 97.5(which is usually 100, yes, I’m one of those guys) my arrival time was 90% and my block commitment was 100%.

I'm not paying 30% or more in fees for the service, that defeats the purpose. If YOU as the driver don't like the structure, get another job or complain to YOUR management about the fee structure.

Staring at those $20s all I heard was all you drivers kvetching and bitching and moaning swirling in my head. So I handed the driver a $20 and said it's your lucky tip day! As it was a 50% tip. 

She barely batted an eye, and acted as if I handed her a penny, not even an ow wow, just a weak ass barely audible thanks, grabbed it and walked away.

1efo7hh,post,"Ok, apparently my last post was extremely controversial, so I’m making this to clear things up because I can’t edit my post. I’ll start by reiterating what happened yesterday, with as much detail as possible.

I ordered food from Grubhub. I’m the customer, not the driver. I got a couple meals for myself and my mom, and paid a 20% tip on top of the total (which already “includes the tip”, but Grubhub pays their drivers shit so I feel like that doesn’t count). I do this routinely with Uber Eats as well, which is what I normally order food on. This restaurant only had a Grubhub page.  
  
I live in an apartment complex. What makes it annoying to find my exact apartment are the very small signs, but it’s not bad to drive on and I always leave the same detailed instructions in multiple languages. It’s basically a big loop with a couple cul de sacs. This complex is situated on a hill, and it has two entrances. My driver was coming up the hill, and I live closer to the first entrance, so my instructions (minus all the language that says where I live) basically said “go in the first entrance, keep driving down the road, and make the first left. Also, don’t go to the senior center, the GPS sometimes takes drivers there by accident. Please call if you get lost.” (This has happened multiple times, no idea why, so weird). Anyways, that was all the driver needed to do. These instructions were also in Spanish, Arabic, and traditional Chinese.  
  
So I’m watching the driver come up the hill and I see him turn into the entrance. As I’m preparing to go outside, I get “your order has been delivered!” with this picture attached (you may need to tap on the photo): https://www.reddit.com/r/grubhubdrivers/s/2u2y4T4U3g  
  
And then he left. That image you’re seeing, with my food on the ground, is right next to the entrance. He did not call me. He did not text me. No attempt to communicate with me. This is all that happened. He spent 10 seconds on the premises, dropped my food on the ground, and then left. Grubhub gave me a $20 credit for my trouble, so I imagine something happened to the driver.  
  
I thought it was so ridiculous and insane that it would make a good Reddit post. Because like… come on. What the fuck? Who does this? But I got comment after comment saying “you didn’t tip”, “you need to leave better instructions”, and some comments thinking I was the driver..? Some comments asking about a gate code or something? I don’t fucking know. So I’m writing this in the hopes that this is coherent enough to understand. I hope it suffices. It wouldn’t let me edit my last post, so figured this would be a better solution.  
  
In short… don’t do this. Just don’t.",girloffthecob,1722328371.0,2024-07-30 04:32:51,2024-07-30,04:32:51,28,0.75,109,https://www.reddit.com/r/grubhubdrivers/comments/1efo7hh/ok_apparently_my_last_post_was_extremely/,https://www.reddit.com/r/grubhubdrivers/comments/1efo7hh/ok_apparently_my_last_post_was_extremely/,True,,"Ok, apparently my last post was extremely controversial, so I’m making this to clear things up because I can’t edit my post.",top_year
1efmn5i,post,"Hotel reception giving a hard time Hotel orders, we get them.  And some don’t place the room number and have directions to just leave it in the hotel lobby.  If there is a room number I’ll drop it off at the door, but this want the case.  Directions said to leave it in the hotel lobby.  So I did, but in doing so the front desk decided to give me a hard time. 

I’m nice.  So I tell the guy and he is like SHOW IT TO ME RACHAEL!!!  lol jk, but he is like can I see the name? I show him my phone and he is like ‘oh we don’t have anyone here at that name.  Are you at the wrong place?’

I tell him the address and how the diner said to leave it at the front lobby.  

He is then like “no you can’t leave that here!  What if someone steals it?!”

I just told him the diner told me to leave it down here.  And once they get the order you can chide them because I’m following their direction.  I shrug and leave as he is talking behind my back saying how I can’t leave food there.

1ecug89,post,"Orders already picked up by another driver I am sick and tired of going into a restaurant and then saying the order was already picked up. 

This has happened more than once but today took the cake. I was literally 3 min from a restaurant and when I got here the front hostess said the order had already been picked up 10 min before I got there. Hostess also said that they confirmed in the app. Which means that they selected order picked up. So why in the world did they ping me for pickup when the driver was already 7 min into her delivery?

I chatted with support and they called and confirmed that the order was already picked up. 

Here is the issue I have besides the flat pay of a $1 for a cancelled order. 

I was doing a mission where 6 deliveries between 11am and 1:59pm would get a $24 bonus. 

Guess what?!? I’m not getting that because I spent not only time at the restaurant but with support so they could verify, cancel and credit my account. 

I’m done with GH. They can f\#% themselves. 

I specifically asked them about the mission they jacked up and all they ever say is they will let them know.

I used to have my GH as a secondary app on the phone I use for Uber and noticed I get maybe 5 or 6 offers daily (from morning to when I shut off the app). I now am running GH on a separate phone with no other apps running at the same time and it's triggering probably 25-30 times daily now. I may be crazy but multi-apping all your apps on one phone may cause some issues or possibly other apps have some sort of AI to detect you're multi-apping?

Like I said this could all just be coincidental but GH used to pull me about 50-75 weekly and since I've started using a dedicated phone I've easily doubled that amount.

I notice even if the map is bright red and I’m  in the center once I get to a certain dollar amount offers either stop or I get bombarded by no tip offers or low ball high mile offers!    

When there is a mission once I get close to achieving it offers stop and/or low ball offers!   

Has anyone else noticed that on their end?    Whats the most anyone’s made in one day?

1ebwpz9,post,"How often do you do 2 gigs at the same time? So was online with DD & GH at the same time yesterday.

DD $8.25 for 4m popped up which I accepted promptly and before I could go offline with GH , it offered a double $19+ for 8m which I could not resist.

Luckily DD dropoff was going in the same direction of 2 GH restaurants. Was late on GH but not because of multiapping - food was not ready at the 2nd restaurant, and as everyone knows GH loves to penalize the drivers - no matter what...

Made almost $28 in about 45 mins. It was a happy ending for sure.

Did you ever multiapp with 2 gigs at the same time? - It would be interesting to know...

1ebk6dp,post,"Massive order, $3 Pay. I've only been driving for grubhub for about 2 weeks. Just doing it for some spare cash. I'm assuming most of you have seen an order like this but it's new to me. 
I saw an offer for $12, accepted it without taking a good look at it.
I picked up over $150 worth of food, 2 massive bags. I thought, wow this person must not have tipped anything. After delivery I saw the tip was $8.50ish and the pay was $3.70ish.  
How is this even possible? I did the math vs regular menu price vs grubhub price and Grubhub easily made $30+ on this order and I get $3? Do you expect a busy restaurant to just be able to whip up a $150 order in the middle of dinner? I waited 15 minutes for a car full of food and got paid $3. Lol.

Just a lesson for me to not accept shit orders I guess. I feel sorry for you folks who do this full time. I quit for the night after that one.

1e8bmhx,post,"Canceled orders  So apparently grubhub has decided that orders getting canceled by the customer after pick up is complete is no longer Paid in full.  Despite receiving an email a few weeks ago that sounded like a positive change, something about ""you will now be paid a percentage of the order based on how much of it was complete"" sounds good. Oh but no.  Instead you just get $1 regardless.


This happened after waiting for an order at KFC $10 for 3 miles. , it was already an hour old when I accepted it and then i continued to wait 30 more minutes for the order.  I finally get the order and start driving, it is only like a few minutes to get to the drop off btw, and they canceled it almost immediately after I selected ""leaving"".  Which I don't blame them it had been 1.5 hours at that point.

Originally thought this would be a win for me until I saw was only paid $1.  Called support and they basically told me to bend over and take the new policy in the ass like a good robot.


Thought ""at least I got some free food"", but the food wasn't even what the customer ordered which sounded much better then what I got.  The chicken is all stuck together with the skin falling off all soggy and gross.  Pathetic.  Can't believe this KFC is still in business.

1e84ohj,post,"Grubhub vs Uber delivery I've now taken exactly two offers from Grubhub, so take this with a grain of salt...

Navigations sucks.   Can't mark as delivered because navigation is flat out wrong.   (Google maps since they don't seem inclined to have their own)   Finally over-rode after pacing up and down the stairs three times worried about the apartment street address...

Uber at least leads me to the correct unit, without having to run google maps (which apparently sucks in apartments)

I knocked on the poor girl's door requesting contactless delivery, and watched her hold the plastic bag while it filled up at the bottom with sauce.

(500+ uber deliveries and 100% satisfaction, I'd give myself two thumbs down so far for my two Grubhub deliveries.)

1e5erx3,post,"Person who works at jail stole food, should I call the jail? I dropped the food off at 1128pm and the diner reported the food as not received by 1145pm.  This was in a secured facility and the only way in was by the intercom.  It was the 4th avenue Jail in Phoenix Arizona which is a large building with many doors.  

Prior to dropping off the order I felt the diner was shady because it was the Jail building but with no directions. 

So, I messaged the diner asking which door do I deliver the food to?  She said the North West door, and how it was at the corner of this street and the other.  

I texted her every single thing I was doing because ppl with bad directions for huge buildings need to know, “hey, I’m coming with your food” ya know?  Like I’m communicating with you so you get your order.  

I arrive at the door, and I press the intercom button and tell them I’m here to drop off this food order for this (female name), and the person who buzzed me in was a female.  

Again, this is a jail.  The female buzzes me in and it’s a room that only has an elevator and a dark hallway leading to god knows where.  I felt uncomfortable so I left the food in that foyer room.  It def looked like an area I shouldn’t have been in because it was an employee entrance with an elevator that had a key fob next to it.  So I left the food in that room.  I mean why not? It is the jail.  This person knows which door and I’m assuming it was her that buzzed me in.  I’m texting her and I get no response.  

I dropped the food off and just left.  And then 15 mins later it’s cancelled.  I ask her why? And she said “I never got the food and I didn’t cancel it Grubhub did”.

I called Grubhub and asked if I was still going to get paid, and they told me yes.  Grubhub then told me it wasn’t them that cancelled this order it was the diner who cancelled the order through the app.  

Now, I’m like…. This lady, had I not been paid she wouldn’t been messing with my money, but in actuality I’m assuming she stole the food!  

Like how are you going to steal food when you work at the city jail in downtown Phoenix?  

Should I call her work tomorrow and report this?  I have the time I dropped the order off and the time it was marked cancelled.  Idk, apart of me wants to call but then another part of me is trying to do the right thing and let the jail know they have someone sus up in there.

1e44h81,post,"Ticket Warning! Delivery Drivers on University Blvd. (Tucson, AZ) When I started driving for Grubhub last year, I saw a bunch of other delivery drivers parking in the center lane on University Boulevard. I asked a cop if that was legal, and he told me that ""it's never been a problem before,"" so I started doing the same whenever there's no other temporary parking available.

The other day, I was doing this while picking up an order, and I saw a guy taking a picture of my license plate, and someone else told me that it's now potentially a $280 ticket. Apparently the meter people are cracking down now. I got a $10 ticket 2 weeks ago because my meter ran a few minutes over (came out to the people writing the ticket). They've decided to be ruthless.

Just thought I'd let any other drivers know about this. Kinda sucks that they can't seem to get their story straight. Like, why would the TPD tell us something totally different?

Btw there is no reason for GH to rush drivers like a first responder going to a fire as unlike fires that had broke out restaurants cannot complete the meal any faster nor can they even get the meal on the fire quicker just because I rushed nor to the door. 

It doesn’t really matter whether I was already in the direction to the pickup before it paged me or finished up what I am doing errands for 4 more minutes ie bathroom my drop off time is exactly the same the food would be out at the same time obviously and the food would arrive to customer the same. So the algorithm should really chill. Ironically I noticed their auto reassign idea since AB5 which came same time as Covid would’t crack down on multi apping or resulting delays to customers at all the way they set it up. 

Also I got a low order attendance violation, not lateness once despite the customer and GH being noticed of restaurant delays.

1e1lc3z,post,"Interesting order last night I took an order last night- $10 for about 3.5 miles.  Burger, fries, and soda.

I make the delivery (it's a warehouse lobby), snap the picture, complete, and start leaving.  I get a text and then a phone call from the customer that that's not where he's staying.  He's at a hotel, one of those well-known chain hotels.  And there is one not far from the restaurant that he ordered from.  Normally, I would leave it as is, I did my job.  But he said that the hotel reception gave him the wrong address, so I figured I'd do him a solid and go back and grab the food (I was near the exit gate, so a hundred feet, no biggie) and deliver to his hotel.  I was going back to that area anyway, to try to get more orders as that's a good area with lots of restaurants, so I figured what the hell.

As I start driving back with the food, I get a text with the address of the hotel.  HMMM  I don't recognize the city. 🤣🤣🤣  I put it into googlemaps, it's over 100 miles away.

Yea, I'd say that he had the wrong address alright.  I called to tell him that unfortunately, he won't be getting his burger.

1dxs2ob,post,"Grub hub not paying this weekend Everyone I called GrubHub and I asked him why I couldn't cash out. They said that they had a system-wide failure and I drove today a couple of orders thinking that well it looks like it's fixed, because it had both options both my bank account which they direct deposit and my instant cash card.

Guess what when I use my instant cash card and paid $0.50 it said that the payment was pending. So that means I get no money until tomorrow and I'm wondering if this is just a clue by for that the app is gone bankrupt.

I think it may be bankruptcy because they can't be so stupid that they don't recognize that while people are on the road they need to cash out for various expenses gas oil food drinks etc. This is not something that a lot of people do with a paycheck week to week. So honestly I think this is done.

1dwuckq,post,"How to steal from GH without penalty  I’m tired of dealing with this company and all their issues. Not letting us cash out, taking money out of earnings and not telling us why, horrible driver care service that doesn’t respond or resolve issues. This company is failing and is on the verge of collapse and soon it will be bought out by someone else or hopefully it just shuts down once and for all. So to help expedite that process I will be teaching you all how to steal food from grubhub without any penalty and while still getting paid for it. 

Step 1.) accept and pick up order as normal 

Step 2.) drive towards customers house, get only close enough that your able to mark “arrive.” Normally that is when you’re about .2 miles away from the customers house. 

Step 3.) Mark arrived and then drive down the road to a random house, take a picture of that house (make sure not to include house number in this photo) then submit it and complete the order as complete. At this point now you’ll be paid in full for the delivery and you have the food 

Step 4.) if the customer contacts you at all asking where their food is or telling you it was the wrong house, ignore them and block the number. 

Step 5.) if grubhub calls you on behalf of the customer, ignore them. If you want to answer you can and just say you delivered the order to the house the gps sent you and it matched the address but you don’t have to answer them. 

Step 6.) at this point the customer will most likely have the order canceled, they will get refunded for the order and you will keep the entire pay for the order and keep all the food. Congrats! 

This works 100% of the time and you get no violation on your account and there is zero accountability or safeguards from grubhub to prevent us drivers from taking advantage of this system, so enjoy it! You could actually make money for getting free food, how awesome is that! Hopefully if enough of us start doing this grubhub will be forced to shut down from losing so much money. Grubhub likes to take advantage of drivers, many customers do as well, but why let them? I think it’s time we start taking advantage of them. Enjoy!

1dwrtp2,post,"Just got my first violation after 6000 deliveries I got an email saying “A significant number of your orders were canceled between Jun 28, 2024 - Jul 5, 2024…. This is your 1st violation. As a reminder, if you have 3 current violations, your account will be blocked.”

So I went on the app to see what orders have been cancelled. Were customers stealing orders? Was I delivering to the wrong addresses? Was I mixing up orders? Nope. Two orders were canceled by the customer because he thought it was expensive. He ordered twice from the same restaurant and couldn’t figure out how to cancel it until I reached him (different story, he came out to grab it and I said no you cancelled it. He said okay turned around and walked inside). The other 2 orders that were “cancelled” were because of restaurant closure. 

I called support and said how are any of these my fault? Why am I penalized for it? They said it’s automatically generated by the system. I asked if anyone checks it before it goes out, they said no. Then she proceeded to say it’s only for 3 months. I said that’s not the point, the point is I’m being accused of something that is not my fault at all. They then said there’s nothing to do now, you cannot appeal it even until I get 2 more violations and my account blocked.

I’m sure any of you have encountered these unfair practices from GrubHub and others. It’s time to move on and do something else.

1du68w9,post,"A Frustrating Experience. So I reactivated my account, just for the extra income for the summer.  Appeal was accepted Mid-May. and had to order a new driver card through Driver Care as for some reason it wouldn't let me through the app. Card arrived in time for a schedule at the end of May. Monday, no issues whatsoever and being that I live in a region with hourly play a slow day isn't all that upsetting. Wednesday however.... this is where the frustration of GH begins. 

  
I get an order 1 1/2 hours into my first block, nearing completion, I noticed that my app had marked me unavailable and that I needed to update my app in order to mark myself available, complete the delivery, complete the process so GH doesn't think I'm AWOL and I still can't mark myself available... I call Driver Care to see what's up and get told to uninstall and reinstall to see if that fixes it.. it didn't. I get hit with the screen of  needing to reactivate my account etc.. the driver care specialist... realizes that my account was apparently and mistakenly flagged as inactive mid shift.... so I get marked as absent for 3 of my 5 blocks scheduled. My account finally gets activated and despite GH knowingly aware that the fault was on their own side.. I wasn't given any reimbursement for lost pay and would not receive any.. so accountability is clearly out of the question as usual.

  
The kicker - my new driver card won't be reactivated via the app as it continuously gives me errors.. I notify GH of this and they ask for me to send a photo of my card to activate it, they state it's activated though the app doesn't reflect that. I reiterate this to them and they \\of course ignored it. Few weeks later I get an order that requires me to use my card and low and behold it doesn't work.. which kills my entire schedule and availability... Contact Care once again and it turns out that when they activated my card, they activated a completely different card that wasn't even in my possession.. alongside my card.... Once again no accountability taken.. no reimbursement.. but hey my card is once again active again ""Could be a lie though""

  
Now onto a rather recent matter.. while waiting for order #9 as weekend shifts are often busier than weekday.. I get a notification that i missed 2 orders and would be flagged if i miss 3rd.. upon checking my app. No orders were missed and this oddly comes after an order was cancelled 2 hours after it was delivered. The customer tried to say it was never delivered despite GH showing them the picture of where the food was delivered which had their house number in direct view. (Gotta love people trying to get free meals.) Seeing as I never missed an order, I close out the app and open again and it oddly now shows that I missed an order 5 minutes ago despite it never reaching my app or notification.. I call Driver Care to see just what that was about... and they give me the run around saying I must have been in bad service.. I was right next to the restaurant that was intended for that order with full 5G... needless to say it just seemed like another common hiccup with the app, and of course my profile reflects on 2 missed orders instead of 1 or what should have been 0.

I like driving, and the app wouldnt let me venture out to any hotspots without telling me I’m out of my zone.
So is it worth it? 
Would the deliveries only be within the base?

1dq5h8v,post,"I'm done with GrubHub. Final straw was today with mile-baiting. I'm done with driving for GrubHub as of today. I'm fed up with their latest pathetic trend of mile-baiting on their offers. I noticed they started lying about the total mileage of orders they offer about two months ago. 

It wasn't that bad, the miles were usually more than shown in the offer by one to three miles. Pissed me off but I could deal with it. 

Today was the fucking final straw. They offered me an Applebee's order at 2.2 miles for $12. Great! I went to pick the order up. When I picked it up, the map showed it was 15 FUCKING MILES! That's way below $1 a mile. 

I called support, told them to cancel the order because I refuse to be cheated like this. They warned me that I'll be penalized for it, I told them to go fuck themselves because at that point, I'm never delivering for GH again. And told them to tell their boss to stuff it up their ass, and the customer can starve because they didn't tip close to enough to compensate for the distance. 

I didn't even bother returning the food to Applebee's. My wife is enjoying the food as of now, GrubHub can get fucked! And fuck the entitled customer, too. 

Deleted the app, don't care if I got a CV at all. What can they do to me? Hah! At least Doordash is my main source of gig income, GrubHub has done down the shitter and the orders barely even come by anymore. 

I hope GrubHub crashes and burns. My wife says your food is delicious, Meg R.

1doxwsx,post,"Where Does The Food Go? So I order through Grubhub fairly often. About 25% of the time I get notified that my order has been delivered but it hasn’t. The photos are completely dark or photos of a random wall, things like that.

So I’m dying of curiosity. Where does the food go? Is Grubhub making the whole thing up and creating fake drivers? Or is someone desperate and eating the meals themselves?

Also, any suggestions for avoiding this issue? I feel like I tip pretty well, about $5 regardless of the total even if it’s a large percentage of a small order. I’m diabetic and it’s getting dangerous because I try to time my insulin to take it when my food is on the way. When the food doesn’t appear I’m in big trouble. On the other hand, if I wait for the food to arrive then I have to wait for the insulin to kick in and then my food becomes extra cold and unpleasant.

1dn1dtg,post,"Can any NYC GH drivers share about new fees? Hi all, NYC-er here. I got an email several months ago sharing something about new labor laws requiring NYC delivery drivers to receive an improved hourly wage or something similar (maybe guaranteed hourly wage?), and so GH would start suggesting lower tip amounts and instead assess a new fee, and I trashed the email by accident.   
  
Since then, the suggested tips have gone from 12%/15%/20% to 5%/7%/10%!!! They've also added a new ""Other Fee,"" which is usually $1 or $2. So now we have Delivery Fee, Service Fee, and Other Fee. Can anyone with NYC GH driving experience share how much exactly goes to drivers out of these fees? I want to make sure I'm tipping appropriately. Also, do you expect the tip to be a percentage of the total food + tax, or the entire total after all fees? Or is it more about distance/effort, since most NYC gh drivers use bikes & mopeds? And how much is EBT in NYC these days (or is that just a doordash thing?)? Finally, for folks like me who don't pay any delivery fee and a reduced service fee because of Amazon Prime, do drivers get a reduced amount from all Prime members, or do you still get the same amount and someone else 'swallows' that discount?

1djzqan,post,"GH using GPS of former address Has anyone heard of GH sending a driver to a customer’s former address via GPS, even though that address is no longer in the account, and the correct current address is printed on the receipt? 

So, I order tonight, the system tells me the order has been delivered, but when I go to find it at the front desk of my apartment building, nothing is there (there are detailed instructions about the name of my building and how to drop off in my account). I check the photo the driver took and it is definitely not my address. Moments later I get a text from the resident of the address it was delivered to (having found my phone number on the receipt), and it turns out to be the house next to where I lived almost 10 years ago. The two addresses are across town from one another.

GH had the order redelivered, and when the second order was delivered the new driver called and asked if the address on the receipt was right (it was) because “the GPS is really messed up.” This driver clearly paid attention to the address on the order but was confused about why the GPS was trying to send him to another part of town. 

When I look at both past orders in the app, they show a drop off location pin of my old address, but the order clearly has my current and current address on it. My account also clearly has my current address in it and no other, though it surely once had my old address in it. 

Besides being in different parts of town, the two street names are nothing alike. I think the part of it being next door to my old address is that my current and correct address begins 231 [current street name] and it was left at 331 [old street name] and it was trying to take the driver to my old address at 333 [old street name]. First driver didn’t read clearly on several accounts, but he was also led astray by the GPS.

This time I left it inside of the secured (buzzed in) apartment building lobby. Picture in the app. Go to my next delivery, pick up is at the same restaurant. They tell mevthe guy reported it as undelivered and it was canceled. I called GrubHub and tell them I have two video proofs that I delivered it, they tell me it is not an issue. 

My question is ...why are customers allowed to report something as undelivered when there is proof it was delivered?

The commercial areas around here are probably going to be safe,  but residential areas might be completely inaccessible without risking death or major damage to my car.

1dfugkw,post,"does the app on ios do better with ""ghost orders""?  I use my primary phone for GH which is an android, S23 Ultra. I know the apps are similar but somewhat different depending on the operating system and one of the main issues I get are missing notifications for new offers despite the notification volume being on. sometimes I'll get the cowbell and others, nothing.

Another issue I run into is when I do see the order on screen and hit accept, it'll refresh and mark it as missed anyways. I don't care about my acceptance rate all that much, but it's frustrating because this always happens with high paying orders. I wanted to know if this was commonly an android thing or its the fault of the app overall. I was thinking of buying a small used iPhone just for delivery gigs to help as I've heard this issue isn't nearly as prominent on ios. I wanted to hear some insight from others before doing anything.

1dega0o,post,"Has anyone actually gotten Grubhub to pay out on a mistakenly cancelled order? Or, for that matter, even gotten a call back from anyone when you elevate a concern?

I had a pickup at a Wetzel's Pretzels inside a Walmart that wasn't plotting correctly, so it wouldn't let me arrive myself at the location. So I called in to have driver care arrive me as I was walking in. While I was waiting for a live human being to answer, I asked for the order, and they told me it had been picked up by another driver. It was a $15 order with about 6 miles to the store from the notification. I told the rep that eventually answered what happened....misplaced location, couldn't arrive, already picked up. I did that from the parking lot. For 5 minutes this guy stumbled around trying to find my account, trying to find the active job, and I'm getting the automated notifications that I accepted an offer but hadn't picked up yet the whole time. He finally tells me he's having computer problems and that I should call back. At the same time, I get notification that I've been removed from the delivery. I ask him if he did that and he said yes, and that I should call back about the cancelation pay. 

So I immediately call back, and for 7 more minutes I try to explain the situation to a different rep. She tries to tell me that I got dropped from the order because I never marked myself as arrived, so I wasn't eligible for cancelation pay. We went round and round and I explained the facts 3 or 4 more times until I asked to speak with a manager.

Manager comes on, listens to the whole story AGAIN, and eventually says someone else from driver care will contact me, and there's nothing else she can do. 

I called back a 3rd time a couple of hours later to ask when I should expect the call from driver care. I was told I would get an email in a couple of days. That was on a Wednesday. 

The next Monday, I call again, since I haven't gotten an email. This rep drags things out for 5 or 6 minutes and finally tells me that the decision was made not to pay cancelation pay since I never arrived myself. I immediately asked for a manager again, and the rep says I will get a call back from a manager. That was 2 days ago...no callback. 

I'm not going to starve if I don't get paid for this, but at this point it's the principle of the whole thing. I want to know what I should have done differently to get cancelation pay in this case, and I'm willing to waste some time on hold (while doing other things) until someone in driver care actually answers my questions.

I just don't know how much longer this company is gonna last, the stock is almost all but destroyed, the only reason it's normalized is because the company bought their shares back during the decline. Yes they used what little profits they had to buy their shares back to save the company.

Taken from a recent (April 2024) [Reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/just-eat-takeaway-posts-q1-gross-transaction-value-above-expectations-2024-04-17/) report:

>Its GTV grew by 11% in key UK and Ireland markets and by 5% in Northern Europe, another major one for the company, offsetting an **11% drop in North America** and a 15% decrease in Southern Europe and Australia, the company said.

>""Half of the group's business remains down in the double digits and affects the group's growth/cash generation profile,"" Genelot added.

>Just Eat said its constant currency GTV growth excluding North America of 3% in the quarter was within the 2024 guidance range of 2% to 6% increase.

>**The group said it was still exploring a partial or full sale of its struggling U.S. unit Grubhub.**

>On Monday, it announced its exit from New Zealand.

I don't have a lot of hope looking at the future for us GH drivers. The company seems to be spending a lot of money on marketing though and expanding into different kinds of deliveries like groceries. I'm sure it won't be long before GH will either be dissolved, bought at a bargain (although why would anyone buy a company that is losing money), or maybe merged with DD or UE.

1dctqg1,post,"Can I become a driver for just a few weeks? Unemployed and house hunting gave me an idea. I've moved to the Triangle area in NC, and I'm shopping for a house with my partner. I quit my job and am on sabbatical while we decide where we want to end up settling here. My job is to scope potential neighborhoods.

I used to deliver food (pre-app era) back in college, and it was such an efficient way to get familiar with all the streets/neighborhoods in a town. 

Instead of aimlessly driving around neighborhoods wasting gas, I thought why not do some food delivery work for a few weeks and make a few bucks while I'm at it? Just a couple of questions:



* Is there any reason I can't sign up and just drive for a few weeks? 3-6 weeks likely.
* Is it pointless if I'm only working during lunchtime? I'm not really doing it for the income, but is that generally a busy time?
* Is it true that new drivers have a ""honeymoon"" period where they get the best orders? I've heard this theory about Doordash. New drivers get preferential treatment for a few weeks in order to ""hook"" them before things level off. If true, great! I'll take advantage. But is that just a conspiracy theory?

Again, I'm not expecting to earn significant income driving just 4-5 hours a day. I'd just like to do slightly better than breaking even, I guess.

Anyway, I'm just looking for a gut check on this idea and wondering if there are any pitfalls I'm not considering.

1d9x0hd,post,"No more warnings? They should just give up and shut this service down. I've been doing Grubhub delivery for 5 years. They used to give you 3 warning messages if you were running late. Traffic was insane today in NY with the bad weather and overpopulation. Zero accommodations from GH for the traffic.  I stopped to go to the bathroom today and apparently this was too much so GH took the order away while I was across the street. They have made the check-in radius so small that you basically have to be inside the restaurant to mark arrived now. You used to be able to mark arrived from a half mile away. So I just picked up an order for Uber Eats at the same restaurant and watched the GH order sit on the shelf. 

I go to pick up a GH order from an expensive restaurant and they didn't even check the tablet so never started making the meal. Typical because they get tons of DD and UE orders, but forget to check GH tablet. I cancel because I don't want to wait 40 minutes (penalty against me).

Later I picked up an open block on GH, but wasn't getting any orders (as is usual for GH) so I stopped home to take a break and grab a snack. I turned off GH because I forgot I had scheduled. They used to send me messages to turn the app back on (helpful since I have very severe ADHD memory issues). They no longer send warning messages as I said before and they just cancelled my scheduled block without warning. This company is an incompetent last place (not even runner up).

And why aren’t these people banned from the platform?",tacoma2008,1717640511.0,2024-06-05 22:21:51,2024-06-05,22:21:51,3,0.8,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/grubhubdrivers/comments/1d97jmq/incentive_for_accepting_a_job_and_not_completing/,https://www.reddit.com/r/grubhubdrivers/comments/1d97jmq/incentive_for_accepting_a_job_and_not_completing/,True,,Incentive for accepting a job and not completing it?,search_cancel

Recently I have received an uptick in my daily GH payment adjustment. I work six 11 hours days. My metrics are 100% across the board, and yes.. I accept everything (and I love to piss people off when I say that), because my hard work really does pay off!

Doing it since 2014 and lately my per order average hovers around $32.

Thanks to Prop 22 I receive an additional $50 per day adjustment or $300 weekly average. So my question to other full time premier drivers in the Greater LA region is:

Have you also noticed an increase in your weekly adjustment payment as well?

1cxpvqj,post,"GH Ratings Metric Scenario & Business for Drivers... Restaurant Arrival Time - If the drivers don't press ARRIVED button on time then the Drivers are marked as late even though they might have arrived on time...

Does it mean GH's Location service doesn't work???

Many gig companies nowadays use drop-off time for ratings purposes which should make a common sense.

GH app is perhaps less Driver Friendly... If you are doing a dbl the customers don't  know about it & they try to trash the you on CALL/ TEXT  - and GH is silent...

Acceptance rate should not play any role in deciding whether Drivers should get more business or big orders etc. 

It's a contract & drivers should be free to accept / reject orders at will... however GH loves to embarrass drivers by showing 3 boxes etc ...

I do SHIPT as well, which is owned by TARGET - They got rid of accetance rate way long ago because they realized that it's an insult to independent contractors to force into something they are not comfortable with especially business wise.

If the restaurant is closed upon arrival ( especially on public Holidays ) GH doesn't pay anything to drivers for making an attempt to drive to the restaurant, Time & Gas. UberEats pays $3 - $4 out of respect.

It should all boil down to how many deliveries a Driver successfully completed ( COMPLETION RATE ) with good customer ratings. It should not be based on how many a driver missed.

On Blocks front - there is no penalty to quit BLOCKs anytime on DOORDASH or SHIPT. Giving more Business to drivers on a block is debatable. All do that and I like that but if you trash Driver Ratings due to ridiculous Accepance or Restaurant Arrival Time etc then how on earth good drivers are supposed to Blocks &  get more Business?

I propose only 2 - COMPLETION % ( after accepting ) &  DropOff Time.

At the end of the day GH or any other gig companies will do what they feel right for their business... there are no 2s about it... But can't they strike a good balance & avoid throwing insults thru APP? 

The current GH RATINGS Metric doesn't make sense. This is on top of very less money offered by GH for very long distances. Many blame newbies but I blame the high Inflation & Economy which is forcing drivers to accept nonsensical orders.

I understand it is TL but there are many more points which I perhaps didn't mention here... like FOOD NOT RECEIVED etc.

GH gave me solid money in the past so no qualms, sitting near 4000 deliveries but don't feel like doing as my main one anymore. Still Respect & Love GH and always hoping for positive changes.

What do you guys think? - Do you have any other points to contribute? 

It would be very interesting to have your views.

I took the in-app photo of the food next to gate with the building number and began to leave.

Later I noticed that even though I was paid, the earnings page said the order was canceled. I called support because I figured something sus was going on, and sure enough the agent told me the customer said it was not delivered. I explained the situation, and the agent said she saw my photo of the drop off and said she screenshotted everything and included my statement about what happened. She assured me I would be fine.

Let me preface by saying I'm running on Android & have Uninstalled & reinstalled the app several times to no avail. 
The glitch is: The app plays the cowbell noise to notify of an offer, but won't show me an offer; when I then swipe the app off my screen & press the icon to bring it back up, it shows I've missed 1 offer, do this a 2nd time, it shows I've missed 2 offers, do it a 3rd time & it shows I've missed 3 offers & signs me out. Do it a 4th time & it finally shows the gold offer banner across the top of the screen & allows me to tap it to view the offer.
I can then accept or reject it, and need to sign back in to receive further offers. 
When I check my earnings list to see all offers, none have been listed as missed, because I've missed none.

1cqlt91,post,"Why are drivers not knocking, please at least knock for the love of god I have a small apartment, I'm usually near the door watching TV or something, I do not have my phone near me at all times, I am NOT monitoring it.  Multiple times in a row I've ordered delivery, usually through yelp that uses grubhub, each time no knock and no delivery update. If the time range I was given comes around, I check and it's always still been in delivery mode. Each time, food has been sitting at my door and has grown cold while yelp still says ""out for delivery"" 

Tonight, I literally put in my instructions "" knock on my door"" because I'm sick of getting cold food.  Again, no update, no knock.   I always tip well, a minimum of 20%, and I never change the tip, so it's not that. Checked the door, theres my food sitting there, cold.

1cp26q7,post,"3 proven ways to profit more # Dear Drivers

It's getting harder to earn a decent income with gig delivery apps. Inflation drives up costs for fuel, insurance, and car repairs, cutting into profits. It also reduces consumer demand when prices rise - no one is going to pay $50 for a Happy Meal!

On top of that, the companies behind **these apps are extremely greedy**. They flood the market with drivers, pay them less than they should, and use algorithms to pressure them into accepting bad offers.

**So what power do we have?**

# The power to say NO, SLOW, or GO GO GO

**Option 1: Say NO to ALL bad offers**

Very simply say no to bad offers. Do not let the manipulation of app metrics like acceptance rates affect you. If everyone lived by this rule, the algorithm will start to shift and raise the offer. And there is a lot of room for them to increase. But it wont happen until it starts to happen collectively! Say NO to trash!

**Option 2: Go SLOW on all bad offers**

This only applies to states that have 'earn by time'. If you receive a $5 offer (bad offer!) , the only way you can profit is by delivering slowly. This way your active time pay goes up. So instead of doing that in 10 minutes, push it to 20.

This of course means you are tied up for 10 minutes more and wont get new offers then. Most likely though, because of over saturation, you wont be getting an offer.

So it may make sense to take subpar offers and deliver them much slower than usual.

**Option 3: Go FAST only on good offers**

This applies if you get a decent order. It wouldnt make sense to try to increase. your 'earn by time' because if you finish the order quickly you have more time left in that hour to receive another offer. This will increase your hourly rate.

**So its up to you and us, we can say NO, SLOW, or GO GO.**  
**You control when the wheels move.**

Because of the inflated cost of food thru the app, plus delivery fee, plus service fee, and the high gas prices - the drivers are the only ones getting the short end of the stick. I HAVE to decline orders just to not lose money on deliveries. Some days I get small order after small order bc people are inconsiderate tippers. Or they have SO many additional fees they can’t afford to tip the driver. I just don’t see this as sustainable income anymore. Especially when I can’t make a schedule bc I had to decline orders just to make a profit. I’m probably one of the best drivers but that doesn’t mean anything. I always use a bag bc I deliver food the way I would want mine handled. But none of that matters and nobody cares. Make it a five dollar minimum tip and get rid of the service fee and I think it would change everything for the better. But that won’t happen.

1coflvx,post,"Driver Stats Does anybody else here get the feeling that Grubhub doesn’t want us to be premiere drivers?.  in my market, which is the San Francisco area anymore the only way to get the good paying ones or orders at all is to be on schedule.    in the last couple of months, I’ve been knocked off of Premiere two different times and both times it is on time arrival to merchant.  It seems as though when they give us an order, they have the pick up time so soon it’s like we don’t even have time to find parking because if we do then we’re late. I feel they should give us a few minute grace period Past the pick up time because they’re not accounting for things like parking ,traffic having to stop for a train, etc..     i’ve been doing GrubHub since 2017. I stopped doing it for a while but recently got back into it, but I don’t recall getting knocked off of Premier that easy in the past.  I know in  the past there were  plenty of times I was late  because of traffic or parking and I was premier for three years straight.  Like I said it feels like they don’t want us to be a premiere driver.  Of course, what helps is as you’re driving by the restaurant hit arrived. Sometimes traffic is so bad. I don’t even get close enough to do it before I’m marked late.

1co7e3e,post,"A discussion on Proposition 22 (California) and why you should be premiere and do every order. Well I live in California and with Proposition 22 we are garuenteed 120% of the local minimum wage in the city we pick up in plus .34¢ per mile. 

In Los Angeles, Grubhub uses ≈ $16.156 as its hourly rate. Now multiply 1.2 to $16.156 you get $19.38. 

for every active hour you work you'll earn $19.38. 

So 40 hours of active time equals a guarentee of $775.48. You cannot make less than that because it's law. It's guarenteed. 

Now that we have our earnings for active time lets include the miles.

Let's say that week you drove 400 miles. You went up and down your entire delivery region. 

Note: These are the miles you add up based on what GrubHub says you drove not the miles you think you drove.

So 400 x .34¢ = $136. Take those $136 and add it to your $775.48 and you get a total of

$911.48 in Proposition 22 earnings.

Now let's add the tips.

Let's say customer tips added to $100. 

$100(tips) + $775.48(active time) + $136 (400 miles) = $1,011.48 (Total earnings)

If at the end of the week GrubHub only paid you $910.48(active time + miles), 

no big deal thats where the $1 adjustment will be added on Monday morning. 

If GrubHub paid you $912.48(active time + miles) well congrats you earned more than the guarentee.

GrubHub doesn't have an endless supply of money to hand out so not everyone is going to receive 40 hours of active time. Who do you think is more likely to receive it? A premiere driver who does the work or a cherry picking partner account? You're not outsmarting the system, they will stop sending you offers, plain and simple, if you're off block they have no obligation to send you anything.


And this isn't exclusive to Grubhub, this applies to DoorDash and Uber Eats as well. Although I don't know what those apps use at their hourly base but it shouldn't be too far  off.

The offers recently are almost ALL below $1 per mile, and it seems that GH's ""contribution"" (delivery fee) is almost always $2.

I've also been ""getting offers"" that never show up on my phone, but damn sure I'm getting dinged for ""missing"" them.

The exception to this is 10:00 and later. The hours they can't find people to work. When there's nothing going on or it's late at night, you will never get logged out of this fucker. Not one single time in the more than 4 years I've been on GrubHub have I ever been logged out by GrubHub after 10:00. I will get logged out at 7:00 though for sure

I know it sounds totally paranoid but I forgot the app was still running and then I got a ping 2 hours after I'd gone home. That's twice this week that has happened. So they absolutely 100% choose when and when not to log you out

1cl6b7b,post,"The Dark Side of Delivery Apps: How Algorithms Exploit Workers and Perpetuate Inequality 
Introduction:
In an era dominated by convenience and instant gratification, delivery apps like Grubhub, Uber Eats, and DoorDash have revolutionized the way we order food. However, behind the sleek interfaces and promises of easy income lies a darker truth: the exploitation of delivery drivers through algorithmic manipulation.

The Algorithm: Always Watching, Always Knowing
Delivery apps utilize sophisticated algorithms to manage their fleets of drivers and optimize their operations. These algorithms track an extensive array of data points, including driver location, activity patterns, and even personal habits. From where you live to the speed at which you drive, these algorithms leave no stone unturned in their quest to predict and control driver behavior.

The Impact on Drivers:
For drivers, this constant surveillance has profound implications. Drivers find themselves at the mercy of algorithms that prioritize profit over fair treatment. The algorithmic system is designed to ""starve the poor,"" favoring drivers in wealthier areas or those who can afford to work full-time. Drivers living in low-income neighborhoods or relying on delivery gigs as a primary source of income are systematically disadvantaged.

The Illusion of Progress:
Moreover, the algorithmic structure perpetuates a facade of progress while trapping drivers in a cycle of exploitation. Despite promises of flexibility and upward mobility, drivers find themselves trapped in a system that offers little room for advancement. Income levels are predetermined by algorithms that prioritize profitability for the company rather than the well-being of its workers.

The Danger of Algorithms:
The implications of these algorithms extend beyond the realm of delivery apps. They represent a broader trend in which technology is wielded as a tool of oppression, reinforcing existing inequalities and exacerbating socio-economic disparities. By relegating drivers to mere pawns in a profit-driven game, these algorithms pose a threat to the dignity and livelihoods of millions.

Conclusion:
As consumers, we must confront the uncomfortable truth behind the convenience of delivery apps. We must demand transparency and accountability from companies that profit off the labor of others. It's time to recognize the human cost behind the algorithmic curtain and advocate for fair treatment and dignity for all workers, regardless of their socio-economic status. Only then can we truly dismantle the systems of oppression perpetuated by technology and pave the way for a more just and equitable society.",Special_Attention184,1714956505.0,2024-05-05 20:48:25,2024-05-05,20:48:25,8,0.75,16,https://www.reddit.com/r/grubhubdrivers/comments/1cl6b7b/the_dark_side_of_delivery_apps_how_algorithms/,https://www.reddit.com/r/grubhubdrivers/comments/1cl6b7b/the_dark_side_of_delivery_apps_how_algorithms/,True,,The Dark Side of Delivery Apps: How Algorithms Exploit Workers and Perpetuate Inequality,top_year

1ckta2s,post,"🚫 It’s Time to Take Action: Join the Movement Against Grubhub, DoorDash, and Uber Eats! 🚫  Attention all food lovers, restaurant owners, and delivery enthusiasts! 

Enough is enough! We're tired of being at the mercy of corporate giants like Grubhub, DoorDash, and Uber Eats. It's time to reclaim control over our food delivery experience and support local businesses.

These companies are devouring our wallets with hefty fees, leaving restaurants struggling to survive and customers paying inflated prices. They dictate terms, exploit workers, and monopolize the market, all while lining their pockets with our hard-earned money.

But guess what? We have the power to change this narrative! It's time to unite and take a stand against these behemoths. Here's how YOU can get involved:

1. **Spread the Word:** Share this post far and wide. Let your friends, family, and fellow Redditors know about the injustices perpetuated by these delivery giants. Use social media, forums, and word of mouth to amplify our message.

2. **Boycott Third-Party Apps:** Refuse to support Grubhub, DoorDash, and Uber Eats. Opt for alternative delivery options such as direct ordering from restaurants or using local delivery services. Every dollar withheld from these corporations is a step towards dismantling their monopoly.

3. **Support Local Businesses:** Stand in solidarity with your favorite neighborhood restaurants. Order directly from them whenever possible to ensure they receive the full value of your purchase. Let's keep our communities vibrant and thriving.

4. **Contact Legislators:** Advocate for fair regulations and policies that protect both restaurants and consumers from the predatory practices of third-party delivery apps. Write to your local representatives, sign petitions, and participate in grassroots campaigns.

5. **Raise Awareness:** Organize protests, rallies, and community events to raise awareness about the negative impact of third-party delivery apps. Engage with local media outlets to amplify our message and hold these companies accountable.

Together, we can reclaim control over our food delivery ecosystem and build a more equitable future for all. Join the movement today and let's put an end to the reign of Grubhub, DoorDash, and Uber Eats! 💪🍔🍕 #BoycottBigDelivery #SupportLocalRestaurants #TakeBackOurFoodDelivery",Special_Attention184,1714921464.0,2024-05-05 11:04:24,2024-05-05,11:04:24,0,0.45,55,https://www.reddit.com/r/grubhubdrivers/comments/1ckta2s/its_time_to_take_action_join_the_movement_against/,https://www.reddit.com/r/grubhubdrivers/comments/1ckta2s/its_time_to_take_action_join_the_movement_against/,True,,"🚫 It’s Time to Take Action: Join the Movement Against Grubhub, DoorDash, and Uber Eats! 🚫 ",controversial_all

One time where I did all that was required and verified with one worker and second worker wasn’t satisfied and wanted a screenshot of the order which I could not do because I already accepted with the previous worker. Ended in a ghost delivery. Second time, they wanted my name and signature on top of all order information. I put Grubhub. They said no they want my name because they have that other info already to which I said, then WHY are you making me write it all down? I don’t work for you and if GH isn’t providing my name then you don’t need it. And then they wouldn’t release food without it. Another ghost order. Customers were understanding and just requested refunds and I advised to never order from that location again. 

I called corporate and they apologized and said they will be contacting the store to get rid of this system as it is not suppose to be happening. So if you’re experiencing this where you live I suggest calling their company’s corporate line and reporting them.

1cfeic2,post,"Starting getting payment delays. GH going out of business?  I've had many jobs in my 73 years.  Back in the 70s, I worked as a bartender, and a couple of restaurants, my paycheck would occasionally bounce.  They would always make good the next day,  'run it through again' I was told.  However, it happened twice, on a couple of restaurants, and both of them went out of business within 2 months.  These 'payment delay, you'll get paid on (in a few more days)'  is kinda like the modern day digital equivalent of those bounced checks. GH says 'due to a glitch'.  I  doubt it, I'm thinking they are having cash flow problems, and to my way of thinking, they are close to closing up shop.  GH pays drivers more than the other apps, and that's a good thing and the public show know about it.  Also, the delivery fees are probably higher and that is why we are losing market share.  What GH should do, is sell some stock, invest the money in a star-studded PR campaign, 'yes, we charge a little more, but our drivers are paid more' and I think the public would find the extra delivery charge worth it, if they knew that and we would get back that lost business.

1cedjvo,post,"Does a big tip cause a problem for drivers?   Serious question.  Am I causing a problem by tipping more?  I use Grubhub almost daily because I have a disability.   I am lucky enough to be able to afford it and I also know that I treat the service differently than a typical customer because of my disability.   I don't tip the 20% or 30% as a rule,  unless it comes out to at least $8 because I know it's a service for the delivery not a service restaurant tip.  My general rule is that it's a $10 tip.  And I also try to make sure that I only order from less than a mile away.

Key important details:  I am a ""no contact customer""  and I don't use a cell phone,  so it's supposed to be that they just leave it at the door and send a text.  But I never see the text until later.

I've had two issues recently that made me wonder if I'm actually causing a problem for the driver.   So just now I ordered from Dunkin and got two things and gave a $20 tip just thinking,  ""Hey, let me start someone's day out great!""

The problem I've seen is that if I tip more than the actual cost of the items  (the cost was $14.59)  it seems to cause a delay?     

I usually want to make sure any driver gets at least $10 tip for the delivery,  and then whatever extra Grub Hub pays.   So I sometimes order a lot of things just to jack up the tip.   But I feel like it's a waste of money and I'd rather just make the drivers day and give them the extra money in the tip.

Is this causing some unseen problem that I don't realize?   
Also,  do the drivers know that I'm a reliable customer based on my address?

1cd4kwz,post,"Almost scammed out of a weeks earnings.  So last week I got a phone call and the caller ID was the same as any other GrubHub call. The person identified themselves as GrubHub and told me there was a complaint against my account that said I did not look like the driver who is supposed to pick up the order. They said I needed to verify some information and they would cancel the order. I was headed to pick up and replace it immediately with another order after the verification process was done. I pulled over and started to deal with him on the issue now keep in mind they had my phone number and my email address and the order I was on did get canceled. This gave me the impression it was a legitimate call and I needed to take care of it.  I was sent an email and asked to verify some information from my account. After replying to the email, I was told I would be sent another email with a new password to be used until my payout on Thursday. That was the part that made me feel this might be a little sketchy, but given the fact that while I was doing all this, they had a lot of my information already so I proceeded with their instructions. When I log back into my account, I immediately received another order which was a double pick up paying better and I ended the call and proceeded with my day.  In the back of my mind, it bothered me that they provided the password for me to use and they asked me not to do a cash out until I get paid on Thursday.  A little voice in my head told me this seemed slightly sketchy and I needed to keep checking my account, specifically my bank information.  Sunday night after I finished my last block for the week I was sitting at home and around 2 AM. I started getting massively spammed on my email account.  I’m talking about well over 100 emails in rapid succession from places I’ve never been to online. Thankfully, my initial reaction was to go to my GrubHub account and check my account information again.  Well, wouldn’t you know it? My bank information had been changed to a different routing number and account number. I immediately logged out changed my password logged back in and changed my bank information back to my account. Thankfully, GrubHub puts a 72 hour hold on any payouts after your account information is changed, I had to wait three days for them to re-verify my banking information on Thursday morning my bank account where I discovered I did receive my pay.  The way I figured it was they spammed my email to cover the fact that I did receive an email from GrubHub. Alerting me that my bank information had been changed.

Be careful folks , scammerAH’s getting just enough information to sound legit can really ruin your day.

1c9us2e,post,"Add on at same restaurant fixed? The issue on Android where you can't pick up an add-on at same restaurant seems to be fixed. I had one the other day after the latest update and cried out oh no right after I accepted it. But I kind of knew it was fixed because the add-on wouldn't let me hit arrived because I was already at the restaurant when I got it.

That was the real problem and I told GrubHub about it more than a month ago. I figured that out when I had an add-on at the same restaurant like 2 months ago and the first drop off support completed for me and then the second pick up came up with the arrived at restaurant button which I couldn't do of course at that point.

I should get something for figuring out their problem for them.",AnySoft4328,1713738692.0,2024-04-21 18:31:32,2024-04-21,18:31:32,1,1.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/grubhubdrivers/comments/1c9us2e/add_on_at_same_restaurant_fixed/,https://www.reddit.com/r/grubhubdrivers/comments/1c9us2e/add_on_at_same_restaurant_fixed/,True,,Add on at same restaurant fixed?,search_problem

1c9uajp,post,"Stolen food (again)! For a while I swore off using Grubhub because I had an order stolen back in December (not the first time). I relented and started using their service again after a couple months, mostly without incident. Today, I placed a large order for myself and a friend. The driver arrived within 10 minutes of the order being placed and waited for them to complete the order. I made sure to keep a close eye on the map.

Once completed, she took the food and immediately called Grubhub to say someone else picked up the order (the cancelation cited the restaurant didn't have certain menu items, so THEY canceled it). When I called the restaurant to inquire I was told that the driver (they gave me her name and it was the same name of the driver assigned to my order), picked up the order herself and that the order was complete (no missing items).

I really can't stand some bum loser who wants to take from others because they have nothing. I was refunded and given a credit as well, but the fact that this person strolled off with my food makes me incredibly ticked off.

1c97716,post,"Is my zone just dead? I’ve been a driver for about 4 years, half of that time in LA and half in Pittsburgh. I used to be able to make decent money (obviously not like LA) and it was busy enough to do orders back to back, especially in the city limits. But over the past year, I’ll leave the app on while doing Instacart, DoorDash, or Uber Eats. I’m lucky if I get 1-2 offers per day and it’s rare for the pickup to be within a few miles, many times it’s 4-8 miles away. It seems impossible to schedule blocks as they’re gone instantly. (other than 12-4AM) Do the blocks help and is there a trick to getting them or is GH just not used as much anymore? My stats are all showing 0%, could this also be a factor? I believe that’s because I haven’t been active in the past 14 days.",Zack_BeverlyHills,1713666592.0,2024-04-20 22:29:52,2024-04-20,22:29:52,5,0.86,13,https://www.reddit.com/r/grubhubdrivers/comments/1c97716/is_my_zone_just_dead/,https://www.reddit.com/r/grubhubdrivers/comments/1c97716/is_my_zone_just_dead/,True,,Is my zone just dead?,top_year
