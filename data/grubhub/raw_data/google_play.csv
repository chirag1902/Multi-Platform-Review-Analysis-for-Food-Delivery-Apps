They need to update their system to what DD uses or something similar. They are so slow it takes 2 hrs to get an order from a place that's 10 minutes away. Yeah I can get it myself but not the point. I'm not always able to get out and I'm willing to pay for it to be delivered to me and I actually tip well. Drivers get lost or take weird ways to get to my house and it takes them longer.

They are consistently late. I've ordered from multiple restaurants that are not busy and only a mile away. I've also ordered during high and low traffic times. I live in a suburb in Florida. They pair your order with a lot of other orders from the same restaurants. The driver has to wait for not only your food but all the others. Their fees are ridiculous too.

I live in a big city with hundreds of restaurants poping in and out of existence. I like to try each one at least once. But I have no way to keep track of ones I've had issues with other than writing them down on a naughty list. And have accidentally ordered from the same places twice as I don't always have the list on me. Please if you could add a feature like that. üëç,4,22,2024.18,2024-04-30 20:19:49,,,2024.18
