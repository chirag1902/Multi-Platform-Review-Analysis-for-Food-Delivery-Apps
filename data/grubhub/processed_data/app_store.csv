2024-04-21 22:07:40,"I have 2 delivery apps. I’ve been using Grubhub more recently until now. I rarely have an issue. And customer service was fair. Ordered from Jack In The Box. Received alert my order is on the way. No other deliveries delays. My driver stopped mid way. I texted them if everything was okay. No response. I clicked on request about delivery delay. My order arrived just before being considered late. Noticed my drink did not have seal. All other bags had seals. So I requested “help” again. The drink was the only issue. Customer support said I had an unusually high request for refunds, discounts, and requests and can only give me a $5 credit. Great. But the “unusually high requests, refunds” comment was not justified. I sent request to delete my account. I canceled Grubhub + membership. 

Next time, just lead with $5 credit. And end it there. Now you have one less customer and revenue.",1,App Store,GrubHub
2024-04-22 01:52:51,"The worst experience today with customer support. There is some kind of UI glitch in grubhub app system. I ordered two items and it lets you add an item “BUT” instead of adding one item it repeats everything with addon as a whole new order. I ordered and it gave me confirmation on the app for the order being prepared and delivered. But coming back home I see two separate orders and charged my account twice- first order with 2items and second order with same 2 items and addon item repeated. Customer support dint even help me with refund or care to create a “ticket” raising glitch concerns. If the glitch is with grubhub and restaurant delivers you wont get refund. Complete ridiculous instance with no help and refund being an elite member. When I have the confirmation on the app why will I go and check my email back and forth, that is ridiculous. What is the use of an App if I had to check my emails for confirmation of orders. What is the use of even having membership with having no help. What will I do with your apology?Grubhub #badcustomerservice #nocustomerservice #dontorder #uiglitch",1,App Store,GrubHub
2024-04-22 14:25:54,"I preorder in advance and later I received a call telling me they do not have idli, so I asked if they could do anything about it. They said they could not update the order and instead told me to cancel and reorder again. I told them that if I cancelled I would not reorder again, so if they could change it to something else I would be ok as long as the price was close, the employee was not helpful but in the end the proposal was accepted.

 This feature should be in the restaurant and other providers app so that they can cancel the product that is not on their menu and update the order price accordingly. This ruins preorder since later you can get an out of stock call and now you’re plans are changed, which happens but with an app and such a big infrastructure supporting it behind, an easy product update for the order with a click saves time and money to everyone involved. The restaurant does not loose the order, the user does not loose their time and grub gets another user engaged.

I know there are more steps involved than just allowing restaurants to change the orders but there must be a way.",2,App Store,GrubHub
2024-04-27 02:20:37,"I’ve never written a review of an app before, but unfortunately, my experience with GrubHub has pushed me to.

I placed an order for food for a party with a local restaurant. While the wait time was more than an hour, that was no problem since we knew the place is popular and we had some snacks to tide us over.

The real problem came when, as the expected time for the delivery came and went, no order showed up. Checking my phone, after finding and reviewing my order history, I saw that the order had been canceled because of a driver issue. That wouldn’t have been a huge issue in general, but by the time I saw the cancelation, the restaurant was closed, and we had to start the whole process over again with another local spot.

If the app had just made it clear that the order had been canceled on their end that would have been fine, but the fact that I had to dig in the order history and that there was no indication that we shouldn’t be expecting our order to arrive is a huge UI issue that completely undermines the whole point of the app—convenience and predictability.

Very disappointed.",1,App Store,GrubHub
2024-04-27 22:53:24,"I never thought to use Grubhub until I got a promotion from one of my credit cards for Grubhub+. This was around 2 years ago and it worked fine. Fast forward a few years and I get a similar promotion. Now, I've used Grubhub around five times in the past few months and NONE of the orders have been on time. Additionally, two of these orders never made it to me. I would watch my driver drive in circles in random parking lots, delaying my order by 15 minutes many many times before bringing it to support where they reluctantly cancelled my order and refunded initial payments. 

Long story short, Grubhub drivers are corrupt and slow and that always falls back on the customer. Would not recommend Grubhub to anyone. Please do not waste your money on this delivery option",1,App Store,GrubHub
2024-05-01 09:42:22,"I ordered a meal that came to over $40 after fees, taxes, and tips. I tried to contact my courier with the phone numbers provided by grubhub for neither to work. I tried calling  and texting to get sent to voicemail. I have reached out via twitter, Grubhub app, and by phone and have been getting the same automated message saying I’ve gotten too many refunds despite the fact that they just flat out took my food to the wrong place. I don’t make much money so naturally, I want a refund when I didn’t receive something I paid $40 for. $40 is nothing to a multimillion dollar company like them and they’d still rather argue me down and give me a fake apology for “the inconvenience” rather than giving me my money back and trying to keep a customer. I don’t feel safe spending with them again because now I know they can just keep your money when they don’t follow through just because they feel like it",1,App Store,GrubHub
2024-05-03 15:03:25,"Total disaster of a company. I made an order and they duplicated it, charging me twice. I reached to their customer “care” team so it could be cancelled and they said it would be a store credit… no thank you; this wasn’t my error you can refund my card. They transfer me. It fails. This happens three more times before finally a successful transfer happens. In the meantime the unwanted and unauthorized food gets delivered. They now say they can’t refund it because it has been delivered, and offer a store credit of less than the amount they charged me. Every single part of this was due to multiple errors on GrubHub’s part, but they could not have cared less about actually fixing the problem. 

App removed, data deletion request submitted, chargeback submitted to my bank, warning made here. Save your sanity and done waste your time or your money supporting a company that clearly has no interest in owning up to their own mistakes.",1,App Store,GrubHub
2024-05-03 22:59:39,"Grubhub is so horrendous that in the future I will be using anything but it. I will also recommend my friends, family, and every person on this platform to avoid it. After a long day and exhausting couple of weeks, I decided to use a gift card and order a Grubhub sandwich. Despite having my address set, location on, and having ordered from this restaurant numerous times, for some reason Grubhub sent the order to the wrong restaurant that was over thirty minutes away. This restaurant was on the upper east side and would require me to take a bus AND a subway to get to. When I asked for my money back or to transfer the order, I was told that was impossible. This has happened before. And I’m not sure if their customer service has tanked, but I was kindly given a refund and apology. This time I got what seemed like an AI generated response and someone who cut me off and ended the chat early without answering my last question. It is alarming that Grubhub has not fixed its app nor does it care about its loyal customers. I will be looking to other ordering platforms or ordering from restaurants directly and cutting Grubhub out. I suggest others do the same until Grubhub is willing to put people over profits!!!!",2,App Store,GrubHub
2024-05-10 19:59:17,"I don’t ever ever ever write reviews on anything cause I simply.. just don’t care, but this particular time as I am pretty furious I would just like to drop something here. No im not a older “Karen white lady” writing this even tho im about to sound like one, as a Generation Z as you will.. 
with the way prices all over the country are just soaring you might as well get delivery cause its cheaper than shopping now, that was my plan for this afternoon after working from 3am-1pm cause I’m tired and didn’t want to cook. EVEN PAYING a GOOD and FAIR TIP especially when the location in which the food was coming from was really close, the driver HAULED to my apartment door with a loud temper making it well known he’s in a bad mood and proceeds to drop my food off. I go grab my food from the door , open the bag .. and BAAAADAAA this dude really SMASHED I mean SMASHED my food in and tampered with the seal. Just that one incident and I’m never using this app again, just that incident and I don’t trust your food handlers. I’ll stick to doordash. Do better .",1,App Store,GrubHub
2024-05-12 13:06:43,"Despite providing delivery instructions in multiple languages in the app and texting these same directions to each driver, there was a 50/50 chance that my food would be delivered to the wrong address or not according to specifications. When customer service was notified that my order was not received, I was asked to I checked outside of the building for my order. This request is irresponsible and unsanitary since most of my delivery requests are to a very public building and the directions are to deliver to the main office. So, why would I look for my food outside let along risk my health and safety by eating food that could have been tampered with since it was left outside in an unsecured space? The customer service is horrible! In my opinion, I deserve a refund every time your driver does not follow directions. I even had the subscription with this service, however I have now canceled my subscription and will be deleting this app. Hopefully DoorDash is better.",1,App Store,GrubHub
2024-05-15 23:23:44,"First, I’ll start off with my annoyance that I deactivated push notifications for advertisements and I just got one about buying gift cards for graduates. my phone is not an ad vehicle delivery system. The preferences should be respected, because what’s the point of upsetting your customers?

Second, there’s some restaurants that I never wanna order from again, in New York City there are so many that are constantly changing. But it’s hard to check my own rating history of a place dishes that I liked or didn’t like. And hard to save and highlight dishes that I love. So when family and friends come to visit, and I want to suggest ordering in instead of going to a restaurant, it’s hard for me to remember what might fit with their food preferences and the restaurants I know in love.",4,App Store,GrubHub
2024-05-26 23:34:50,"I’ve always used DoorDash. I used Grubhub for the first time three days ago and the driver threw my order on the front porch right in front of me and then started cursing about having to deliver an order 20 miles away right in front of me as he stormed away. My second order was for 3 people. $85 for two orders of nachos and a burrito (including delivery fees and tip). It took an hour (which was expected) and they forgot both orders of nachos. So 2 of the 3 people were starving. Then they refunded me $30 (the price of the two nacho orders). So with fees I ended up paying $50 for 1 burrito. I then had to call Grubhub to complain and they reluctantly refunded me the delivery fees and tip, after the chat function didn’t help at all. Worst food delivery experience I have ever had…by far. DO NOT USE",1,App Store,GrubHub
2024-05-29 08:09:28,"The absolute worst service by far. Sometimes they get better for a time and then come back with zero people skills when there is a problem with a delivery. I’ve gone back and forth using this app and I should have never looked back the first time I deleted the app when I ran into terrible service. This last time, the representative didn’t give me a chance to respond and somehow I managed to get the same rep when I reinitiated the chat which didn’t make a lick of difference because they don’t care to try to fix the issue. Most the drivers they employ are often heading to multiple random locations while their en-route to deliver your food.

They might have gotten better about this recently, but they’d issue refunds on items that were never delivered (often drink items like a soda or coffee or whatever) that were less the price you paid for and doesn’t account for taxes, service fee, etc. I’m surprised they’ve upped their rating on the App Store because they had gotten abysmal and appear to remain a poor service. Just don’t use it, you’ll thank yourself later.",1,App Store,GrubHub
2024-06-03 16:12:38,"For years I have almost exclusively used Grubhub for delivery and I get 3-5 deliveries a week. I love Grubhub for their restaurant selection and how easy it is to use.  

I live in Philadelphia and over the past year (especially in the past 2 months) I’ve had multiple deliveries cancelled. Many of the drivers do not know how to navigate the city and get lost in very easily accessible drop off locations. They rarely contact for assistance in trying to me. It’s become extremely frustrating. I will be using other apps to see if I can actually get my meal after waiting 45 minutes then being told it’s cancelled as I watch my food drive right by.",3,App Store,GrubHub
2024-06-07 13:59:45,"To whom it may concern, before the updates when I placed pickup orders at restaurants, the app would show my name (Nicole B) in bold print so it is easy for the staff to find my order and hand it to me (even to the point that I had an option to click that I received my order) but this app doesn’t do that. Last night I picked up my order at Il Mondo and I showed them my receipt via grubhub but they wanted to see my name and the evening person in charge was putting up a challenge but I managed to get my order. Please do better. DoorDash does a better job when it comes to pickup orders so there isn’t an issue between a customer and restaurant staff.",3,App Store,GrubHub
2024-06-09 13:35:31,"Been using this app for a couple of years, had a handful of orders canceled most of which were last minute.

Most recently I ordered breakfast to my place while in an Uber home. No traffic, road closures, etc and got back to my house easily and unhindered. Driver was 1-2 min from my house, with my food in their car, and canceled because there “was no route available,” even though my Uber had dropped me off moments before the call. The driver did not even try to get to my place, but I’m sure they got to enjoy the food my family and I didn’t receive. Thanks for the full refund but I’d rather have my food, or at least more notice than one minute before the expected delivery. 

Deleted the app and sticking with DoorDash or Uber eats.",1,App Store,GrubHub
2024-06-13 05:36:09,"My food has been delivered to the wrong house on multiple occasions! Because of this, I started adding very detailed instructions in the driver notes telling them how to get to the right house, even providing a description of my house. Still, my food was delivered to the wrong house! The driver even posted a picture of the wrong house in the chat, yet GrubHub refuses to process a refund because of the other times their drivers failed to deliver my food to my house!! I have been willing to provide pictures of my house and everything to get this corrected every time it happens. I paid for my meal to be delivered, but I never received it. The driver even got a tip for NOT delivering my food to my home. Failure to refund the money I paid for a service they did not complete amounts to theft. After years of being a grub hub customer, I canceled my GrubHub subscription and subscribed to Door Dash. Somehow their drivers manage to find my house unlike my most recent experiences with Grub Hub drivers.",1,App Store,GrubHub
2024-06-13 16:00:17,"My food usually arrives fine with little to no issues, however, the delivery times are RIDICULOUS compared to other delivery services. They’ll give you an initial estimate on delivery time, which’ll be about 40-50 minutes, but because they dispatch the order to drivers that are SOO far away from the restaurant, the delivery time almost always extends by at least 30-40 MORE minutes. Even if I get delivery in the same town, it takes a long time because they almost always send drivers from the next cities/counties over. While they do have a “Help” section for late deliveries, I don’t use it, because they take the ENTIRE tip from the drivers who have already done their jobs, to send out refunds. | The GPS/tracker also has moments where the driver seems to just sit in one spot for a prolonged period of time. I don’t know what that’s about, but it happens quite often.",3,App Store,GrubHub
2024-06-14 01:33:18,"I placed an order using the wrong card and tried to cancel the order. The app wouldn’t let me do it myself and so I called the restaurant and they weren’t able to cancel it either and suggested I try to call grubhub support. The restaurant said they wouldn’t make the food bc I told them I wanted to cancel and would wait for me to let them know. Grubhub doesn’t even have a number to call and when I used the chat to speak with an agent they said they couldn’t cancel the order because the merchant was already making the food. When I told them that the restaurant isn’t because I told them I wanted to cancel the order, they offered a discount on a next order that went from $5 to $10 within 3 minutes. 

What kind of business doesn’t allow people to cancel their orders, I tried to cancel within 5 minutes of placing the order because I realized it was the wrong card. A terrible experience and service I won’t be using again.",1,App Store,GrubHub
2024-06-14 15:08:29,"So I’ve never used Grubhub before but my family says it’s cheaper than DoorDash plus I was ordering food that DoorDash didn’t provide surprisingly, I add in all the necessary information into Grubhub, including my correct address, but then I notice my driver is going to complete opposite direction of my house. I then check to see where they’re going because maybe they’re dropping off a someone else’s order but then I get the notification that my order has been delivered. I check my info and I see that it completely changed my address because they apparently “don’t deliver to my address”, but why didn’t they tell me that early before I wasted my money!!!! I specifically typed in my address before ordering and there was no problem at all, it said it’d be like 30 mins so no worries, but no. I no longer am worried about my order or getting it back, I’m happy to give someone else a free meal but I want my money back before I cancel my subscription and delete Grubhub. There’s no where on the app to even report my problem! I have to actually call the company and report it because all you can do is leave a frowny face ☹️ telling them that the info they gave is unhelpful. I expected good things but I guess I expected too much, Grubhub has lost a valued member.",1,App Store,GrubHub
2024-06-16 17:33:15,"Grubhub is the only delivery app I use where the driver is supposed to be Kim yet Kevin delivery’s my food. The drivers are usually too lazy to actually delivery to an apartment door and in to much of a hurry to ring the doorbell and hand you your food in place of leaving it in a random location on the porch.

Customer Service is simply disappointing. I do however like the new refund policy because dealing with the above and less than satisfactory customer service after you’ve spent $$60 on a pizza, wings, and the pre charge tip will make you lose it when you find your cold pizza and wings have been sitting on the floor of the apartment buildings foyer for the last 30 minutes. 

Do yourself a favor and use DoorDash, Uber Eats, or Instacart. They understand the assignment.",1,App Store,GrubHub
2024-06-20 17:25:02,"I have an instruction on my account saying do not leave my food on the ground where the bugs are. Not only do they leave my food on the ground every single time they do so immediately without knocking or ringing or making me aware of their presence. They also ignore any messages that come in along the way like make sure I get salsa for my tacos. Tipping is optional yet I tip generously as long as they follow my one instruction. I rarely have to tip with GrubHub because absolutely never is my one instruction followed. Customer service is wretched but since tipping is optional, and my instructions are clearly not followed, I am able to get my tip back, though nothing else is ever done about the consistent problem. I don’t want my tip back, I’d much rather not have the food that I just purchased be placed on the ground. But since that seems an impossible dream my Grubhub standards, I’ll keep taking my tips back.",5,App Store,GrubHub
2024-06-21 04:07:24,"Grubhub is better than most delivery apps, but it is still way more expensive than ordering directly from the restaurant. Most restaurants in my area add at least $1 to all menu items to compensate for grubhub’s fees. A meal that should only cost $12 usually ends up at $20 or more (that’s nearly double). It’s great if you are sick, short on time, or just plain lazy. 

Using Grubhub for food delivery on a regular basis is a luxury and reserved only for the wealthiest customers despite the fact that the app tells you you’re saving money with a membership (I “saved” more than $400 in the past 6 months!?). 

My market research indicates this industry only has a matter of time until it fails though since none of these companies have earned any profit and most restaurants feel reluctantly obligated to participate. Save yourself some money and time, get out of the house, and do the right thing by calling restaurants, using their individual apps, and visiting in person to double check that your order meets your standards before Grubhub gets involved (nothing is more dissatisfying than when a delivery driver forgets a part of your order).",3,App Store,GrubHub
2024-06-23 22:20:56,How many times have I ordered from Grubhub and had a delinquent driver/carrier that stole my food or wasted my time? I lost count. Grubhub needs to make it harder to become a driver and punish those that have numerous red flags and complaints against them. Grubhub makes sure I get my refund but it’s the time wasted (while I get hungrier and angrier) waiting for food that is never gonna get here. I’ve had drivers that don’t want to take the ELEVATOR in my building when I’ve buzzed them in and need me to go down. I’ve had drivers who can’t pick up the phone when I need them and I’ve had drivers that go and hang out while they’re accepted my order… it’s exhausting and I’ve stopped using apps for food deliveries. Hopefully someone reads this and can agree.,1,App Store,GrubHub
2024-06-24 21:19:38,"I say luck of the draw because it is. You need to be selective of your restaurant choice, as in a reputable one. I love Grubhub’s service and I use it quite frequently. When I have ordered in the past, the drivers would bring me incomplete orders. I finally said something to the driver who then referred me to the restaurant, who then referred me to Grubhub. Drivers are not allowed to check orders? It was a Grubhub order so you have to deal with them? It is difficult to navigate the third party site to lodge a complaint, which by then dinner had long passed. So really, it depends on the restaurant.  Also, I have discovered that some drivers will do two deliveries at once and it will push the time back.",3,App Store,GrubHub
2024-06-28 19:10:51,"I have constantly given this app chances. I was a Grubhub+ member for years. And the drivers are not what they used to be. Flat out disrespectful, stealing food, delivering the food in a disgusting state, and not following any directions. Driver ratings are not enough. When they refuse to answer the phone, take pictures, or tell you to contact customer service on them and they do nothing about it it’s time to go. I’m wiping my hands clean of this app. Everything is too expensive for me to be paying what I am just to experience disappointment after disappointment. Membership is cancelled today. And if there’s something I need so bad I would rather waste my own time and gas and just get it myself. It only gets two stars because it’s not the restaurants fault Grubhub does not hold their drivers accountable. -10 out of 10. Will not use again.",2,App Store,GrubHub
2024-06-30 21:05:37,"Unlike Door Dash where you can fix the pin location on the map if it’s off, you can’t with GrubHub. I’ve gotten cold food because that’s how long it took the driver to find me, I’ve had my food dropped off at the wrong location, I’ve had to go to customer service time and time again with no resolution. They emailed me 2 months ago (the last time I’d ordered was 6 months ago) saying the issue as resolved and they updated the pin location. I ordered today and when the order was confirmed, the pin location was still in the wrong spot. Tried to contact customer service and was told they’d escalate it… again. I told them to just cancel it and I’d go out and buy food somewhere else and they said they could not refund me but could give me a credit for what I paid to be used on a future order. I declined as I just wanted to be reimbursed for an order I likely would not get. It was escalated and I was told the same thing and offered a $15 credit, then a $30 credit, still insisting they couldn’t refund me.

This service is so incompetent and you can never get in touch with the drivers when the location is wrong so it’s useless. I’d give this 0 stars but the least I can give is 1 so 1 star.",1,App Store,GrubHub
2024-07-05 22:55:09,"Ordered a $40 meal and left tip, only to have the food stolen by said driver. Malaki (driver) decided to take off with the food after submitting a picture of delivered food which was a blank photo. 

I specifically requested for the food to be handed to me in fear of stolen food and was even going to leave more tip if the driver was nice. Once their car was on my street, I asked my boyfriend to wait by the door so he can receive the food. As soon as it said the food was “delivered,” he looked out and there was nothing. 

This is extremely frustrating because I work in the food industry and know that the runt of this will likely fall on the restaurant I ordered from. Although I received a refund and it should be processed in 5 days, hence why I’m not leaving a 1 star,I am disheartened for the restaurant who had already made the food. I hope Malaki is not allowed to steal more food from customers and restaurants. Will not be using grub hub again.",2,App Store,GrubHub
2024-07-06 21:05:04,"I ordered food and it said the estimated time for delivery was 2:50-3:10. I’m watching for a notification to see if he’s finishing up a delivery for someone else, and maybe that’s why he’s driving in the opposite direction across town. Nope, get a notification that my food has been delivered, along with a photo of a clearly homeless person on the side of the road. Last time I checked, an address for a house isn’t the same as on the side of the road. So I try to call said driver, no response. Luckily I’m getting a refund but this isn’t the first time that grubhub has either been over an hour late, forgotten drinks, and now is just handing out random peoples food to people on the side of the road. Maybe they should make their app more accessible, considering that it took me 15 minutes to get ahold of literally anyone to ask for a refund for food that I paid for; and maybe they should make sure their drivers for delivery are not going to steal food. Crazy how I’ve never had this problem with Uber eats though.",1,App Store,GrubHub
2024-07-09 17:08:31,"I was signed up for a Grubhub Plus membership without knowing and was unable to get a full refund for the subscription fees. I hadn’t opened the Grubhub app in over a year, then noticed some stray transactions from on my card which I thought might mean a hacked account. I looked into it and I had been signed up for a paid Grubhub Plus account without my knowing, and did not even get a courtesy email to let me know I had been forcibly signed up. The customer service team was only able to provide one of two fees back as a refund, and dropped the chat before I could contest. UPDATE: I got charged for ANOTHER month of membership on the day that I reached out for a refund. They promised to refund me for the previous month and cancel the membership, but instead they pushed through the next month’s membership fee and refunded that. They were inflexible about their refund policy even though all of these charges are due to their carelessness. So now, I’m stuck paying two months of fees for a service that I never signed up for. Really disappointed in this service. Will be ordering from DoorDash next time!",1,App Store,GrubHub
2024-07-13 04:19:47,I made a simple order and ended up driving to the restaurant for the missing items and by the time I got home everything was cold and I just wasn’t hungry anymore. I called customer service and they wanted to give me $5 and a 10% off my next order 😂 like that’s supposed to make me wanna order using this app. They offered me 5% off my next order initially and I just thought that was hilarious. The customer service agent even agreed but he wasn’t allowed to do more. Which I get… but people pay more for the food in general and then get slapped with fees and tipping just to have a cold meal with missing items and for you to have the audacity to not offer a full refund or even half a refund 😂. I can’t make this stuff up. Thanks for your horrible policies and lack of logic I guess. I paid $30 for a laugh I didn’t think I needed.,1,App Store,GrubHub
2024-07-17 06:17:24,I’ve ordered a couple of times to Grubhub and the service is very unprofessional. I have had two times that have ruined my experience with this app. The first instance was with my delivery driver. Everything was going well I got a picture from the driver sending me a picture of him holding my meal and drink but when I went to grab my meal I realized he took my drink which was unbelievable! I asked for customer service but I never got a response back from that. Later on today I decided to order again. I ordered two hours before a store closed and the status of my order showed “being prepared” for those two hours. I finally had to contact someone for them to give me a refund. It’s just very unorganized and disappointing.,1,App Store,GrubHub
2024-07-21 23:24:20,"From Gryo King. I called the food chain multiple times and received no answer. When I decided to contact Grubhub customer service, the representative assumed I wanted a refund then proceeded to lie and claim I received a number of unusual refunds even though I JUST started using this app this month (July 2024) and only had an issue with ONE food place. THAT problem was the hurricane occurred and I placed an order while power was still out in certain places and they were actually closed (even though Grubhub claimed the place was open) so they gave me my money back. THAT was the only refund I’ve received out of 2 other food places I’ve ordered from

After getting no help from Grubhub Customer Service, I called Gyro King back and the owner or worker claimed they would fix my order but never did. I will never order from Grubhub or Gryo king again. This is exactly why UberEats is better",1,App Store,GrubHub

Address in the app was wrong so I chatted with Desmond to see if I can change it and let the driver know to deliver it to the correct address.  He said he contacted the driver and all was good.  App said the food was delivered but there was nothing on my doorstep when I went to look for the food.  Texted Michelle and she said she went to the wrong address and couldn’t take a picture at the house she delivered the food.  Chatted with the GH help desk and they had to cancel my order and issue GH credit so I had to re-order my food.  So here I sit waiting another 45 minutes for them to, hopefully, deliver dinner for my family…. I’ve never seen such incompetence.",1,App Store,GrubHub
2024-07-22 06:06:08,"The app lets you give feedback to the restaurant and to the driver who delivers your food. It does not allow you to give feedback to the driver who accepted to deliver your order and decided to skip out on it, nor does it allow you to give feedback to corporate for their handling of their drivers’ failures. And unfortunately, this sort of thing happens about 10% of the time, with no way to address the problem other than to deal with the problem other than to accept a $5 coupon for a two hour delay on the stone cold food that a responsible driver finally delivers.",5,App Store,GrubHub
2024-07-22 18:01:17,"No food delivery app is perfect. After all, someone outside of the app is physically doing the driving and caring for your meal. Like with any other app, you will have some amazing drivers and you will unfortunately have some who are terrible or clearly do not care. When you have to deal with the crappy driver experiences, I feel that GH does a pretty good job with customer service. 
I have always been 100% refunded for a meal that never made it to my home. The competitor UE has never reimbursed me for a full meal. GH will give discounts off of future meals for other subpar driving experiences like food arriving late.
I miss the 1 time per month $10 off any pickup order deal GH had. But, GH’s customer service is easy and reliable. And they do a great job at refunding when it is necessary.",5,App Store,GrubHub
2024-07-23 15:12:13,"I signed up after not having it for two years so that I could send my best friend breakfast on her birthday. They delivered the wrong order from the wrong company. When I complained, they didn’t give me a problem about refunding it and I said I didn’t want to refund. I wanted them to resend the items, the help us person said that they could not resend it but since I got the refund, I could go ahead and place a new order. The new order was placed and delivered, and when my friend went out to grab her food, the driver spilt her drink all over her sandwich. I provided a picture of the spilled drink showing the liquid on the floor as well as the soggy sandwich and the unopened straw, and they still would not refund my money. So I called and spoke to someone in customer service. She claimed to be the supervisor and they would not give me a reason as to why they would not refund this order. I’m definitely canceling my membership and I will never order from them again.",1,App Store,GrubHub
2024-07-27 00:34:19,"Now that GrubHub is legally forced to pay drivers more (GOOD), they are charging restaurants more fees, and in turn, restaurants are charging ridiculous ""service fees"" to make up for it! (Click the info icon next to the charge next time you see one) One of my formerly favorite restaurants now charges an $8 fee on top of everything, plus delivering fee! And of course I need to tip on top of that, because I can't trust how much money is actually going to drivers.

I'm going to start ordering directly again, and using GrubHub as a digital menu only. If you want your neighborhood to thrive, I encourage you to do the same. This used to be a company that added convenience and helped people discover hidden gems. Now it's predatory to customers and business owners alike.

I'm done with GrubHub.",1,App Store,GrubHub
2024-07-27 23:10:23,"I was fine with the small mistakes here and there especially when they refunded me. In the morning I ordered breakfast, which after waiting for an hour and a half with no courier I got connected to customer service to cancel the order and get a refund and $5. Whatever, at least I got my money back, no harm, no fowl. I ordered dinner later that day, received two of the three items I ordered, and had to contact customer service again, only to be treated as if I was lying to them. Excuse me? Get your service fixed and then you wouldn’t have these issues with refund requests. I wasn’t only ordering for myself, one of us just didn’t get their food. The least they could have done was give me a refund but all they would do is give me some pre scripted automated message denying a refund. Pathetic and insulting. I’ve already requested to delete my account and I’ve uninstalled the app, they’ve permanently lost me as a customer after such an insulting response.",1,App Store,GrubHub

And waiting 2 hrs for what should have been 20-30 minutes is a best case scenario. I’ve lost faith in the app due to the fact most orders are just flat out cancelled now after waiting hours, still no info or reason. Just a “We’re sorry but we cancelled your order and you might get your refund in a week from now” message. No attempt at making up for the error that is on the pickup/delivery side. No credit, no coupons, no guarantee that the next time you use the service the problem will be fixed. And yeah I called the places I was ordering from and they all state the order was cancelled from Grubhub’s side. At this point it’s not that Grubhub isn’t worth the hassle; it actually is causing more problems than a delivery app claims to fix. Just completely disappointed.

I sporadically go through this process every 6months to a year when I randomly notice this. Canceling my card, and charges reappearing. I even contacted grubhub to have them stop reoccurring charges. Still was charged for 10 months after this.

Starting December 2024, I’ll choose a different food delivery app to use. Grubhub does not work in Vermont. It works well in California, Alaska, Minnesota, and likely countless other states. However, I’m cancelling my membership and deleting the app because of my experience in Vermont. Grubhub does absolutely nothing when I watch the delivery driver pick up my food, then purposefully bleed the clock until the order is late. Or, it takes the app 45 min to an hour to find a driver to pick up and deliver the order, thereby rendering the food cold upon delivery. In both scenarios, I was offered a $5 coupon on a future order. Yes, I got my food. Was happy to pay for that food. But I would’ve eaten hot food had I acted as my own delivery driver. So tell me, why deal with this app? I’m sorry Grubhub+, but I don’t need you. Thank you for inspiring me to quit your app. It’ll save me stress. This review is not reflective of the app’s performance. Grubhub has a good app. It’s just the people behind the machine that should be aware they are driving customers away.",2,App Store,GrubHub
2024-08-02 22:16:45,"Customer service is horrible they fault you for be a high usage customer. I was told they can’t give me any more refunds, for the order I paid that was messed up. Mind you I have only gotten 5 refunds and I use Grubhub about 5-6 times a week in the last 5-6 months. So naturally if you already have high complaints about orders not being right. I’m gone to have a higher amount order that’s mess up, then average. Especially when the restaurant or driver don’t pay attention to who’s food they are handling.

That not the bad part. When you try to tell that to consumers service they say its nothing they can to and there is no one above them I can talk to. I expressed my concern then the supervisor disconnected the chat In the middle of me typing and that happened twice. So I called the customer service number and guess what I got the exact rude response. That I can’t be refunded for paying for something I never got, and That she’s the supervisor there’s no manager she has a boss but can’t direct him to me and can’t give here last name or ID number. But say “my first name is Denise,”

Of course when I try to contact the driver, Shakro (I believe the translation for that word is “stupid”), he does not pick up his phone. I then try to text him to let him know he delivered the wrong order and I get no response. An hour later I get a text message saying my order has been delivered and a link to see the picture of the delivery. Yeah, the picture was the front of my house taken from the street. Fed up, I try to delete my account and every time I hit the “delete” button, I get an error message telling me “something has gone wrong please try again later”.

I have contacted Corporate still nothing I don’t even have account with Grub-hub and I’m still being charged for this Grub-hub membership.

I’ve spent over 15k with Grubhub on food. It’s my main place to eat. Unfortunately I’ve had to stop today, because literally every other time now the driver shows up to the wrong address. The way the app parses the address when the driver uses Apple Maps vs Google maps is different, and I can’t fix it from within the app (since it’s not my address which is wrong, it’s the app). I called and messaged customer service likely for over 4 hours in total to fix this. The last time I called was the nail in the coffin — driver showed up to the wrong address, delivered the order (40 minutes) had to reorder, reorder shows up as going to the wrong place AGAIN, call customer service to tell them to fix it, they say they fix it after 20 minutes, I go to the order page and see it’s STILL wrong, I had to call the driver to fix it.

Contacted the driver, said they didn’t have the order. Reps said the order was being remade and would be at my house in 11 minutes. Went back and watched the driver, who was way more than 11 minutes from my house, once again not move. Contacted the driver again, they told me they logged off and weren’t delivering anymore. Reps said they would reach out again, order was being remade, and it would get to me in 20 minutes…Ended up canceling the order because it was clear I was in a loop. Grubhub reps need the ability to reassign orders! And I was only offered 5 dollars off for the order being over 2 hours late. Giving Uber eats another try.

They said Denny’s wouldn’t make the order and they weren’t sure why. I called Denny’s and they refused to make it until it was paid for. So I had to go pay and pick it up myself. 
The whole ordeal was extremely frustrating! GrubHub should have an account in place so they can pay for their screw ups so the customer doesn’t have to suffer. The idea behind GrubHub is to be a convenience and it was nothing but a hassle! To add insult to injury, they sent me an email with a $7 off coupon… That was a slap in the face and just burned me even more. If that’s how you repay your customers then it’s a joke GrubHub! Furthermore, I was checking into other peoples comments and instead of replying “we’re sorry for the inconvenience please reach out to us” you should be reaching out to your customers the next day because you have all our information and you have the complaint and you should be contacting us to make it right!",1,App Store,GrubHub

No paying a second tip to a driver to bring the missing food. Amazing. Place an order, get the food you wanted delivered to your door. Just like it’s supposed to work. Yay!

After that, another 45 minutes. I called the restaurant and they said the food has been sitting there waiting for almost 2 hours and no one has ever shown up to get it. They asked if I wanted them to remake it. I said no. I would try to cancel the order. Canceling an order takes an act of Congress. They just want to offer me a credit for a future order. I said don’t bother, I won’t be ordering again. They increase the amount after that. I said I just want the order canceled and my money refunded. Then I have to find another way to get food. It’s just way too much trouble to get something to eat.  Yes I could just drive somewhere to get food, but I travel for work and don’t really know the areas I’m staying.

2024-09-02 08:13:31,The customer support representatives were unhelpful and I also believe gave false information. It seems this is standard practice for grubhub. The delivery driver asked my daughter for the confirmation number via text. My daughter gave them the number. Then directly went to go grab food. Looked all over. Texted driver. No reply. Called driver. No answer. Repeated these steps. Multiple times. Many people called customer service and talked through the events. Many people went on the online chat and talked through the events. No Grubhub help or refund was forthcoming. I don’t really understand the reasoning behind saying that because a number was given they can not refund the money. If food is not delivered should constitute a refund. Not whether or not a driver can convince someone unknowingly to send a number. 🤷🏻‍♂️.,1,App Store,GrubHub

Falsely accuse you of already having an account when signing up for the first time. Outrageous fees and they will try to lure you to buy their plus subscription service under the guys of free delivery fees, but it’s really not free. There’s an order minimums of $12 plus to get free delivery, but then they still charge a service fee which is jacked up high and the same as the normal delivery fee so in reality you’re still paying a delivery fee even though you promised zero dollar delivery fees. The whole app is a scam. If you select pick up vs delivery you will notice huge price differences. Insane mark ups.

So frustrating!!!

To make matters worse, the customer service is a nightmare. When I finally manage to get in touch with them, they seem more focused on making excuses than actually resolving the issues. It feels like they go out of their way to complicate things rather than help.

2024-09-13 01:33:00,"The worst delivery app! I would not recommend this app to anyone! I have had experiences both as a restaurant owner and as a costumer and both are HORRIBLE experiences, as a costumer, I decided to order a hamburger with fries and a medium soda, cost 19 dollars, what was my surprise that at the time of charging it was 35 dollars! When I checked the receipt on the app I saw that they had charged me 6.99 for shipping 2.89 for taxes, and extra 1.89 for ""service fees"" and yet they had the nerve to charge $5.00 as a ""driver fee"" when I never left a tip. And even with the almost 7 dollars I paid for shipping my order took over an hour to be delivered.
As the owner it took me 2 months to receive the money my business earned, I called customer service thousands of times and they just gave me excuse after excuse, it wasn't until I started to push with suing that they gave me my money AND IT WASN'T EVEN THE FULL AMOUNT! The drivers are mostly rude and pushy, they are always late, when the order has gone cold, and the app never notifies me of anything, not even when the driver arrives. They also have a terrible costumer service with people that don’t even talk a proper English and are imposible to understand.",1,App Store,GrubHub

This would be excellent customer service IF I HAD EVER ORDERED ANY FOOD FROM STUB HUB OR THE BREAKFAST SHOPPE, but I haven’t!!  😡

The first several times, I thought it was a funny and would even get a little hungry, wondering how good the food is from the Breakfast Shoppe (wherever that is.). I would politely return messages stating that the driver is using the wrong phone number and to contact whoever actually ordered this meal. 

Yesterday, and again this morning, I am once again receiving messages messages that “my order from the Breakfast Shoppe is on it’s way.”  I don’t know how my phone number became the favorite default choice for Stub Hub drivers, but I would like it to stop please.  It’s no so funny anymore.",1,App Store,GrubHub
2024-09-15 09:25:58,"So the app itself is pretty great. The issue I have is with the quality of drivers. There's a reason why I leave special instructions especially when it comes to drivers and the call box. I stopped paying for a Grubhub membership because I got sick and tired of leaving instructions specific instructions especially with regard to drivers and how they use the call box. The problem is is that they don't use the call box and they just drop my food wherever they feel like dropping it and there's no way to get a hold of the drivers. The drivers are lousy and careless and reckless in my area. It's a real shame because GrubHub is the cheapest of all of the food delivery apps and gives you the most perks for your membership. Until GrubHub goes back to the way things used to be where drivers actually listen to and read and follow instructions I will not justify paying for a membership. I put special instructions in the delivery notes for a reason. I don't write stuff down for my health, I make it easy as much as possible for drivers to find my location especially given the fact that I'm blind and I don't want anyone stealing my food. Overall the app is great but GrubHub needs to do some serious quality control.",5,App Store,GrubHub

The address in my account is correct, they just chose to ignore it. When I went to bring it to the attention of Grubhub so the other driver wouldn’t randomly select a house to deliver to, they said they couldn’t change my address and I should be more careful about the details, and cancelled the order (I checked my account address after the CSR closed the chat on me without an opportunity to respond).

2024-09-21 00:06:31,"I’ve used Grub Hub about 20 times now and I like having choices. Recently however I have had a couple problems with the items delivered. Once it was the completely wrong order. I believe the driver gave me someone else’s order. And unfortunately I didn’t open it up for at least an hour after it arrived. Grub hub refunded me. But I wanted what I wanted and was disappointed. A 2nd time I ordered a sandwich And 3 drinks. I didn’t meet them at the door because of Covid but went and got it a few minutes after the delivery person left. It was immediately obvious something was wrong. This time my sandwich, but no drinks! I contacted grub hub and they reimbursed me for the missing items. Again ok, but I really wanted the drinks. Last was probably the restaurant but I’d like to think grub hub would notice and at least encourage the restaurant to call me. I ordered a lemon cake and I got sent a Carmel desert. They might have been out of the lemon cake. Just call! Ask me what I want instead. I don’t like Carmel. So it was again a disappointment. I’m hoping the GH delivery folks are taught to look at the order and compare it to what the restaurant gives them. I hope they have an item count. 4 thinks ordered 4 things delivered. These would make small errors go away and would make quality much better.",3,App Store,GrubHub
2024-09-21 17:11:20,"There have been times I literally put the food into the customer hands, took a picture of them holding it, than right after I drive away the order gets cancelled! Happens with 1 in every 20 or so customers. Even with all of the positive deliveries, they still deactivated me. Most of my customers leave tips after the delivery has been made. GrubHub never even once reached out to me or looked at the delivery photos before allowing the customer to cancel so easily in the app with the touch of a button! It’s not fair, I literally drive 7 days per week and depending on this to feed my family between jobs. My account was randomly deactivated while I was standing inside of a restaurant waiting for an order! I had just text the customer to let them know I would be arriving shortly. GrubHub never speaks to its drivers to see where the order was left or if it was actually handed to the customer. Now I have to go back and forth with GrubHub Support via. Email which takes 24-48 hours for each reply they send. It’s really not fair and I wish there was more I could do about this!",1,App Store,GrubHub
2024-09-24 05:25:23,"I’m not giving a one star because i understand sometimes maybe drivers are busy. Though it’s insane that every single order I have ever made is always delayed by at least an hour. My original estimate tends to b 40 minutes to an hour, which is still bad since I’ll order from places close by. I live in Hawaii so the island is relatively small and sometimes the places I order from are 10 minutes away. The original estimate is not the best, but then my orders always get delayed and the times change. It’ll go to 10 minutes later, and sometimes an hour later than the original estimate. Sometimes it will even delay more than once without any reason given. Half the time my order is already melted or cold because of this. They should give some points or money back every time it’s delayed. It’s starting to get ridiculous.",2,App Store,GrubHub

I tried multiple times to receive a refund and they kept saying that they are not able to give me one despite me not receiving MY WHOLE ENTIRE ORDER which is absolutely ridiculous. They reasoned it by invalid excuses such as saying i have had issues happen before with the account i was using, which is clearly false because i downloaded the app right before placing the order and have not ever had a previous account with them. I want my refund!! - nyaa simone If you want a guarantee that you will be compensated if your order is wrong do not order from this app! They’re workers are extremely unprofessional and don’t know how to handle any issues except for sticking to the script that is given to them to say when problems like this occur. They have no sympathy nor desire to actually solve your problems. not to mention you will have to wait a ridiculous amount of time for an order that you don’t even know if you will even receive due to their drivers laziness and lack of ability to pay attention to where they are delivering to. I seen that they recently did an update yesterday and all that i can notice that’s different is now they don’t give refunds at all no matter what is wrong with your order!!

I chose the quickest pick up for $3 extra, order said delivery would be delivered in around 45 minutes. I kept washing the app and I saw that it was never picked up. So after an hour, I called the restaurant and they said yeah your order has been sitting here. I went on the chat and complained. Eventually I had to leave and go pick up the order myself only to have the driver say they were on their way an hour and a half after I ordered it. They credited me five dollars. I ended up paying extra for speedy delivery, seven dollars service fee from GrubHub for the order and paying for a tip to a driver that never actually picked my food up! Terrible customer service!!

The last 3 times I used this app their drivers picked took my order from nearby (within a mile or 2 from my house) and drove them 30 minutes in the opposite direction. 2 of those times we ordered frozen desserts that melted completely. The hot food wasn’t even good anymore by the time it arrived. We even paid extra for the priority delivery one of the times and it made no difference whatsoever. When you complain about the order, after they’ve already ruined your night, their customer service leaves you fairly certain nobody cares about the issues and nothing is being done to correct them.

I naturally had a difficult time trying to find the driver. Also, the driver did not call me even though he was lost for 10 minutes near my apartment complex. I suspect that he did not want his identity revealed. He also took a picture of me instead of the food. I immediately alerted Grubhub customer service  of the potentially dangerous situation, but they only gave me $5.

I opened up the bag and it was another persons order. I paid around $30 for my food and the food I received was about $17. I contacted the driver because I understood that it was just a simple mistake that could happen to anyone who just delivered food to 4 different people from the same restaurant in under 30mins and I didn’t want to contact Grubhub and get her in trouble. So while i was talking to her on the phone she said she felt so bad that she ruined my dinner and that she was gonna call Grubhub and right this wrong.

Their customer service department called and said THE DRIVER DIDN’T REALIZE MY HOUSE WAS SO FAR so they just let him keep my dinner, I guess?  Customer service also suggested maybe I have my own address wrong? (Don’t worry, I checked, and yep— same address they’ve been delivering to for five years now). 
Before they cancelled my first order I called the restaurant directly, twice, and was told they gave the food to the driver, but he was too slow, so they sent it out again, and it never reached me.

Also had an issue where I wanted to cancel an order but couldn’t do so from the app; I had to get in touch with customer service to cancel. I also wish we could rate the drivers.

I was misled to thinking that for 30 days I will get no delivery fees and no general fees don’t give me wrong. I know you for business but the extra dollars just so I can get a drink still charged a bunch of money so I’m not asking you to do anything for your company.

I contacted customer service and they issued a “credit” as if I’d ever want to use this app again. I asked if the driver would receive consequences, and the customer service rep rushed me off the chat. Also, they cancelled my order so I can’t see the driver’s name or information.

That was on me 100% change the address order gets stolen. I’m not even at my house right now. I’m dog sitting and I’ve had the worst luck when it came to food whether the dogs eating the food or there’s not really much here. So I was just excited to finally have some chipotles.

They’re IMPOSSIBLE to get in touch with to actually rectify the situation. I’m sure some automated system will eventually respond to this with the customer service phone number which is an absolute joke. 

I understand that mistakes happen (like watching the driver go in the completely opposite direction for 30 minutes until they reassign the order to a new driver who did the same thing and finally reassign it to a driver who actually goes to the restaurant only it’s closed by that time… which has happened to me on more than one occasion) but when they happen multiple times and there’s no effort by the company to proactively make it up to loyal customers that’s when they lose those customers. 

I’ve been a plus member for a long time but I’ll be cancelling my account and switching to one of the many other delivery options available.

I told them please do not I still have an issue but every last one said the same thing and without ever offering any help just hung up on me. The chat is exactly the same. They are scamming people out of their money. And taking no responsibility for horrible service. They will not listen to you or even answer a question.

Even if your order is ready at the restaurant on time, it will still be around 30 minutes late because (it looks like) the drivers drop off 3 other people’s orders between picking up your food and giving it to you. This is completely ridiculous, as not only does it add at least 30 minutes to your delivery time, but your food will always be cold by the time it gets to you. The charge for delivery is not worth it by any means. You have the option of “priority delivery” for an extra charge of course 🙄 which just means “if you give us 5 more dollars, we’ll deliver when we said we would.” At this point the only effective way to use the app is to place a pickup order, which you could just do on the restaurant’s website for cheaper, making the app obsolete.",1,App Store,GrubHub

Customer service lied to us about the ETA when we requested help in the app, and when the food finally arrived two hours after we ordered it, it was completely cold and had clearly been sitting a long time (for example, the guacamole had turned brown) and everything had to be reheated.

Then when I use DoorDash I get better text updates, better success rate on drivers, and no delays with cancellations. For example my last order was from Coldstone and the estimated delivery time was 11:30 which was over an hour after they closed then eventually they canceled.

So I typically find myself waiting over an hour to two hours for my food. And when I reach out to customer service asking can I just cancel, they tell me I cannot cancel my order because the restaurant has started to prepare it but who wants food that has been sitting for two hours?

PLS it’s so annoying that the instructions are almost always ignored. I have chronic conditions that make movement hard and if I’m ordering delivery it’s because I’m having a bad day. 

I understand a driver not following insane instructions but my instructions are there because I have two gates in my apartment complex and the codes are different. I also provide instructions on where to park so they don’t have to fight for parking on my block. I’m just trying to make both our lives easier and it seems like nobody ever looks at the instructions. Then I have to go hunt for my food outside the gate before it gets stolen or I have to talk on the phone with a stranger who sometimes doesn’t speak English.

There is no quality control with the services being provided. My last driver ripped me off, they marked the order as delivered and sent me a picture of them driving past my house.

About 20 minutes after recieving a courier Grub Hub cancelled my order due to ""delivery issues.""

But whatever ‘happened’ it would be great if the order was cancelled sooner than 2 hours after I ordered. I order late because I eat dinner late because I work third shift. Other restaurants I could have ordered from closed before my order was cancelled. Both times. 
It’s a real turn off to using this kind of service. I’m already paying a premium for fast food to be delivered this way. The service should be flawless given how expensive it is. 
And yet it comes with unexplained delays which result in… a cancelled order. Both times it was obvious there was some problem long before the order was cancelled. We’re talking a fast food order from a place within 10 minutes of delivery location. I get maybe an hour at most. After that the order should be canceled. I shouldn’t have to wonder where my food and money went for an additional hour. Feels like a cheap Russian mafia operation rather than a sleek Silicon Valley billion dollar tech disruption. 

Back in the Stone Age when I managed a restaurant, if an order took two hours to be delivered, the food was actually delivered, for free, along with a sincere apology from me, and a promise their next order would be free. Because I cared, about them and their repeat business.

But before all of this even happened i asked for a refund (keep in mind i never ordered from this buffon of a app before ) they said i already refunded on too many accounts who would take the time out of there to refund something or scam GRUBHUB out of anything. then the lady proceeded to end the chat on me and not help me with my issue whatsoever so no do not order from grubhub stick to uber eats or doordash",1,App Store,GrubHub
2024-12-16 05:24:26,So I have recently found out if you are unlucky like me and have a hard time ordering out and use special instructions you better hope they never mess up your order. I have had constant issues with delivery service that’s not the actual drivers fault at all. If you have a messed up order of course you report the issue hoping it gets resolved. I unfortunately have to report more orders than most because I am feeding a family of 5 when I order. There is a cap for how much of your money you spent they are willing to give back to you apparently. Even if the order was messed completely up if you hit this cap you are out of luck and they offer you a 5 dollar credit like that will replace the 20 dollar meal. Don’t use the service if you ever expect a refund for messed up food.,1,App Store,GrubHub

Go to another app look up the same store - lots of results. Search by the brand name on GH and the honey results come up. Same thing happened with tomatoes.  Lazy searches that only look for the first word instead of a key word. The substitution choices are ridiculous, you can’t do a search to add your specific subs if they aren’t listed and have no place for notes. There is a reason I only use GH when there’s a great deal, because the app is that clunky and in more ways than mentioned here.

He got the supposed Manager on the phone but I don’t think she was. She had absolutely no authority to do anything other than to credit me $7! Let’s not forget that I did not receive the 2nd order either!!! She said she couldn’t do anymore than that! My advice: do not use GrubHub!!! If you do and there’s a mistake, you are S.O.L!!!!! Use DOOR DASH!!!!!

The delivery ETA just keeps going up with the clock, and there’s no way for me to cancel or report the issue. I just have to wait for my food to never get here before I can ask for money back or anything. And frankly these days this is what I expect from this app… Even if I get any money back on tonight’s order, I’m fed up with GrubHub’s consistent glitches.

Food can be over an hour late and wrong but all you can do is complain to an ai that will give you $5 off coupon you have to go and link up for your next order. Drivers show up pick up food then cancel so they need to find another driver. Now it’s giving me an eta of 20 mins ago when they are looking for a new driver. Only had one order go smoothly. Rest always have an issue either missing items which Grubhub has no way to fix only late. Food is always cold or warm if it’s suppose to stay cold. Always late.

The second representative I spoke to told me it would take 24hrs. It didn’t.

Today I ordered from Dairy Queen and was informed by my delivery driver that their ice cream machine was broken. I thanked him and went to help chat to get it refunded. Apparently due to my other refunds I wasn’t allowed any more refunds? My first thought was.. the nerve of these people to keep my hard earned money for mistakes that weren’t even my fault. After thinking about it and arguing over text and on the phone I was completely fed up. I understand that they do this for people that steal food but if they only investigated further into the problem it’s clear that I have nothing to do with food not arriving due to the store saying they don’t have it. Now they tell me to go through this other long process in order to get my refund. Absolutely not! Grubhub I am appalled at how you treat your plus members. These people will do everything they can to make it harder for you to get your money back. If you would only look into the cause of the refunds further this would never be an issue. I’m done with Grubhub! I recommend using delivery associated directly with the business you want food from or another app that cares more about its customers. I mean all this could have been avoided with a little more effort on their side. The nerve of these people STEALING my hard earned money.,1,App Store,GrubHub

If an address says “Main St” why would you turn off of Main St to go to a different place ?? They have frequently left my food on the side of the road on the ground behind my house where I have no access to get it unless I get in my car and go search for it.

I had made an order (did the free + trial), waited probably an hour or so for my food after it said he picked it up and was on the way , it placed for a location 15 minutes away from me when there’s a location 5 minutes from me. I contacted them about it trying to see if they could fix it as it was not allowing me to, they said they couldn’t do anything about it. So I decided I would get over it. I eventually got my food, it was cold like I mean completely cold almost as if the ac was blowing directly on it. I contacted support to have them cancel the subscription as it wasn’t showing up in my settings. They said they canceled it.

Today I got a notification from my bank saying the charge for Grubhub has failed as I transferred my money out of my bank. So I contacted Grubhub support they told me I don’t have a subscription and it only went through because there’s something with my bank. It has been trying to charge for the last week apparently after I looked at my bank statement. So I asked to be transferred to a higher up and I was told that was against Grubhub rules. Now I knew that was a lie because when I contacted support about my food they wouldn’t cancel it so I asked to be transferred to a higher up. After she kept going on about how they can’t do transfers she disconnected the chat. I still haven’t had this problem resolved.",1,App Store,GrubHub

Happens all the time. And then they’re delivery people or couriers sometimes don’t deliver your order if they can’t find your apartment and don’t follow instructions and don’t contact you. And then sometimes they pretend they deliver your order when I see them drive right past me in and out of the apartment because I wait outside. They are just TERRIBLE! And they don’t give you a refund if the delivery driver doesn’t deliver your order.

I’ll constantly see the drivers driving around in circles somewhere for whatever reason. The worst part is you have to tip them before you get assigned a driver but if you don’t tip well enough you sometime get drivers who harass you over text and wait outside your door to confront you. When I bring this up with support they just offer me $10 in credit. It’s a hassle to cancel your order if you accidentally put in the wrong address or weren’t finished. Even if you try to cancel right after you hit the “place order” button it makes you fuss with a crappy customer service person.

Had a bad experience ordering from a restaurant locally. The food was completely cold, items were missing, or replaced with the wrong items. My issue with GrubHub is that you can only contact them through their chat function and the representatives just copy/paste the same annoying platitudes over and over again. They apologize, but refuse to give you refunds, or want to give you credits. They should have an option to speak to a real representative.

I have had someone just totally not even deliver my order, had it delivered to the wrong house, and had my orders wrong. But everyone aside from once, the drivers don’t even respond to their messages. And when you reach out to help, they not only take forever, but they don’t really help with the issues.

I had an order that was never sent to the restaurant, so I waited an hour for nothing to arrive. I also had to cancel an order because I had chosen the wrong delivery type, but when I went to do it, the app was having issues and would not let me. By then, it was too late to cancel. Customer service was agin not helpful in accepting the blame for the sites issues and did not give me a refund close to what I had paid. Very frustrating.

2025-01-27 03:46:02,"I’ve only used this app a few times, it’s never been great, but we usually actually got the food this last experience had been the worst by far. We ordered pizza today, it was estimated that the pizza would arrive in around an hour. I got a notification later that our pizza was done and our driver was on his way to pick it up from the store.  

Then without the driver contacting me, the delivery time was pushed out an additional 20-50 minutes. We waited until the second delivery time arrived where I was notified by the app that my pizza was delivered, I checked and nothing had been delivered. 

At this point, it’s almost 2 hours after I placed the order. I call the delivery driver, and he said that he pizza had already been picked up, when he went to the store. (Though he did mark it “picked up” and “delivered” on his end?) He said there was nothing he could do to help us that I have to call GrubHub and the store making the pizza. There’s no good way to contact GrubHub or request a refund for this order. For how poor of an experience people seem to have there should be an option for users to mark an order as having not received it on the app. 

I don’t think I’ll ever use GrubHub again, poor service with the driver, both lack of communication on his end, and the fact that after waiting for hours we didn’t even get any food, I don’t recommend. Use DoorDash or something.",1,App Store,GrubHub

2025-02-06 17:32:55,"If you’re looking for a food delivery app that consistently gets your order wrong, delivers ice-cold food, or just never shows up at all, Grubhub is the way to go. My experiences with this app have been nothing short of frustrating, and I’m convinced it’s the worst of the bunch.

First off, missing items are practically guaranteed. It doesn’t matter if you triple-check your order—something will always be left out. And good luck getting a refund or any kind of meaningful customer service. Their “support” team usually gives canned responses and leaves you hanging.

Then there’s the wait time. If you’re expecting your food within the estimated delivery window, think again. Delays are the norm, not the exception. I’ve had orders arrive over an hour late, and sometimes, they never show up at all. The best part? You’ll still be charged, and getting a refund is a battle.

With all the competition out there, there’s no reason to keep using Grubhub when other services are more reliable. If you enjoy cold, incomplete meals and endless frustration, by all means, give it a try. Otherwise, save yourself the headache and go with literally any other food delivery app.",1,App Store,GrubHub

First of all, the app is confusing, with completely separate but similar looking interfaces for off and on campus dining. To make things worse there’s a switch for delivery vs pickup which completely separates the interface again. You have to decide this before even selecting a restaurant to get your food from or else you have to go all the way back to the beginning of your order. Also there’s no easy way to save common spots, and not an easy way to search for locations so every single time I order, I’m scrolling through a long menu to find my location. Not to mention that I’m constantly getting logged out of the app, causing even more issues.

It seems that the first driver must have declined. The restaurant apologized for the delay and found someone willing to deliver. He did it with a smile. I don’t know the real reason I have this problem. I have heard these reasons, “ parking is tough “, or  I must go to the lobby to get my order. I understand “driver safety and “independent contractor”.  I live in a secure condo on the 7th floor.  There are two elevators. Deliveries are made frequently. I always tip generously.

2. Not sending a delivery person AT ALL. So the restaurant and I are both waiting forever thinking maybe it’s just delayed, only for me to contact support and find out that cancellation is the only option.

I have been temporarily living with my daughter in NC and have not had a problem with Grub hub delivering to her address with my credit card address being in another state whereas Door Dash wanted the two to line up before I could reactivate the account.  Grub Hub has been excellent to do business with. On a whole other issue when I was trying to order from the same Indian Rest from Door Dash they listed the rice as an additional purchase as if the rice did not come with the dish and was needed to be purchased seperatly.  I called the rest to verify that the rice did indeed come with the ordered dish of which they answered yes it was not necessary to order it optionally.

But again, I just spent the night eating alone and regretting ever using this app. Unless you’re a gazillionaire and don’t mind waisting money, this app isn’t for you. Very displeased with the poor customer service I received. Never again grubhub, you just lost a good tipper. I still left a 30% tip on my order. I’m never ordering from you people again :(((((((((((((((((((",1,App Store,GrubHub
2025-03-23 05:28:53,"I have given this company multiple chances, twice everything was fine. However, the last three times in a row. My food has arrived cold and been sitting out for so long that it is now a health and safety concern. That last line was inexcusable. It took over an hour and a half for my food to be delivered from Halal guys. By the time it got to my door, it wasn’t even lukewarm. I did not feel comfortable eating it at that point so I requested a refund. They refunded the $4 french fries and gave me a five dollar credit towards my next purchase. I spent just over $30. I am so sick and tired of being overcharged for food to have it show up at my door inedible. I’ve canceled my plus, request requested my information be deleted, and taken the app off my phone. Have the day you deserve Grubhub. May your food always be late and cold.",1,App Store,GrubHub
2025-03-27 05:04:35,"On several occasions now, food has been delivered late. This was the worst and last straw. We placed our order at 10pm. It was picked up 10:59pm, which was the initial estimated delivery time. Fine, that happens. Th delivery driver then proceeded to arrive at 11:40pm, when the drive was maybe 10 minutes if that. Talking to an initial customer service agent, she explained the driver had multiple orders but to rest assured as their drivers had “warming bags.” Our food was cold upon arrival. Not slightly warm, cold. Another service agent echoed the first’s sentiments; both saying they could not provide a refund. My family is staying at a hotel for vacation, so we had no method for rewarming the food. Though honestly, I wouldn’t feel safe eating it anyway. I am beyond frustrated and would not recommend GrubHub to anyone. They lack punctuality and have zero customer service. Account deleted.",1,App Store,GrubHub
2025-03-30 13:30:35,"What a nightmare. On Friday night I ordered Taco Bell. The order is 1 hour late and the driver delivers it to the wrong building. GH processes a redelivery. This next order takes 2 hours. Customer care just kept deflecting with “oh this isn’t the experience we want you to have here is $5”. I eventually ended up getting a $17 credit. 

Fast forward to Sunday AM and I’m ready to use this credit and just give it another try. Nope - same deal. I wait 1 hour for IHOP pancakes and deal with the same copy and paste replies from Customer Care. In my chat with her I said 3x please do not give me a credit I won’t use this app anymore. But that was still all she came up with. After 1.5 hours of relentless griping on my end, I was able to get my order canceled and refunded. 

Avoid this hassle at all costs and use DoorDash. GrubHub is messy.",1,App Store,GrubHub
2025-03-30 15:13:39,"Every order I have ever placed is always late or just takes forever. My food sits there at the restaurant getting cold and by the time it gets to me it’s soggy and cold. Not sure if this is due to a lack of drivers in my area but Uber Eats never has this issue. This is not an exaggeration, EVERY single order has taken over 1 hour to get delivered after the food is ready at the restaurant. Even when it’s been 10 minutes down the road. One time it took so long I just gave up and went and picked the order up myself. When I got there the restaurant told me my food had been marked ready for over an hour and they felt so bad for me that they remade all my food. 

I also don’t like that you cannot change your Tip afterwards like you can in Uber Eats. The fact that you tip before even knowing how food the service was is ridiculous in the first place but to then no allow you to remove the Tip if you get poor service is even worse. Had a driver literally set my food on the ground in pesticide once even though I put explicit instructions not to set my order on the ground and to set it on the table I have outside just for this. He set it on the ground still when the table was 2 feet away.",1,App Store,GrubHub
2025-04-03 15:56:02,"My first experience and order with them was horrible. There must be some sort of glitch in their system but they refused to refund me for their apps mistake and take accountability. I ordered it said it was canceled and I’d get a refund due to 1 of the stores not being open—got it so I ordered on DD. 
Got my food from DD and the order I wanted but GH said was closed. As Im halfway through eating the DD when GH knocked and came to deliver the initial order. So they lied and it did go through and got delivered. Now I’m stuck with duplicate charges and cold food from GH because the app is janky. 
DoorDash and UberEats are so much better. In the time it took for GH app to say canceled and  glitch to assign a driver anyway and then deliver it with no notification to me—I had already finished my donuts and bagel from DD bc their better and quicker. The GH food was cold and half my drink was missing.",1,App Store,GrubHub
2025-04-05 16:15:27,"I’m hard of hearing AND have vocal cord paralysis. I have put that in my instructions that I cannot talk over the phone without hurting my voice (if I can even hear you) ON TOP OF selecting text notification. But instead everybody and their mother wants to CALL me when I CANNOT TALK OR HEAR. And when I tried to figure out how to reach out to customer service I kept running into FAQs instead of an option to call or chat. I found a number through Google and called customer service which I shouldn’t have to. I CANNOT COMMUNICATE VERBALLY, but Grubhub left me no choice and I had to use an inhaler after the call from all the air I had to pass through my vocal cords to make noise. Deleted my account and will be deleting the app. I have been relying on delivery a lot since even going to the grocery store or a drive-thru is nearly impossible for me to do anymore with my communication issues (I bring a whiteboard or type on my phone but people can’t or won’t read anymore, and I can’t always have a friend or relative around to help translate if I NEED something) so this was beyond a disappointment.",1,App Store,GrubHub
2025-04-07 02:47:46,"Taste an order at 8:30 at night on a Sunday said the order was processed. Said the order was out for delivery and should’ve arrived by 9:10 PM by 9:30 PM. I got a message saying that it was a menu issue and my order would not be placed, and I was receiving a full refund. I called or chatted with GrubHub and the only thing that they could say was that I’m sorry, but it was an issue on the food and even though for an hour I was expecting food. All they could offer me was the maximum $10 credit which doesn’t even pay to have another meal brought in for the inconvenience of having to wait over an hour to be told that my food would never arrive. Not be happy. Customer is being told that sorry you’re disappointed is all of script that I’m not happy with a customer service.",1,App Store,GrubHub
2025-04-08 17:44:35,"I was a frequent and LOYAL customer who ordered food from here almost every other day This week, I ordered my food and the app said my order was delivered. My order was not delivered and there was no delivery picture. The driver simply did not deliver my order. Customer service told me many times that they will not be giving me a refund. I asked them many times because I thought they didn’t understand the situation…. it’s worse that they understood and didn’t care.  That is a terrible way to lose your customers, ESPECIALLY loyal ones. I cannot afford to order on this app and not receive my food. I do not like the way customer service treats their customers. I informed Grubhub that I will now be using DOORDASH for all of my future orders :) Please consider treating loyal customers (and all customers) with respect and kindness in the future.
UPDATE: They literally gave me the same driver, as I ordered from the app due to the last resort. I am disgusted they gave me the same driver, who was supppperrr creepy and made me come up to his car… crazy that they STILL didn’t consider a refund. Clearly this app is disorganized and has stuff going on behind the scenes. Doordash will now be the service I use at work as well until Grubhub fixes things.",1,App Store,GrubHub
2025-04-13 00:47:20,"Will never use again. My son is in the hospital after a major hip surgery. He was very specific about what he wanted for his first real meal. After over 3 hours we still hadn’t received our food. Finally someone was headed to the restaurant. I called the restaurant and asked if the food was sitting out or if the food was being made. He let me know that our food had been sitting there for over 3 hrs, before he got there and he is the manager. Right after i hung up with the terrible manager, Grubhub cancelled our order. The said all I can do is reorder on the app and gave a small credit. Now our food is once again, an hour from being delivered. Let see if we ever get it. 0 confidence. As a mom in the hospital trying to keep a kid in pain happy, this became an emotional situation. Do better.",1,App Store,GrubHub
2025-04-14 19:54:23,If you order something and there are any issues with the order or delivery you would think you could tell them and they would fix it. We have not used this app in 4 years. We order pizza and didn’t receive the order. I called grubhub and they said it’s the pizza places responsibility. The store replied that since we ordered via grubhub that it was their responsibility. Makes sense. Grubhub then said I receached a cancellation limit. I asked how many cancellations is the limit since I’ve never use the app and they said they didn’t know how many they just can’t help and the money can’t be refunded either. Long story short…. We paid for something. Didn’t get it. Was never notified of a limit or with  no refunds disclaimer. Grubhub robbed us of $50.,1,App Store,GrubHub
2025-04-18 00:20:17,"The location marker in the app does not correspond with the address location in Google Maps and there is no movable pin to set the correct location. The app literally sends the driver to a totally different location every single time. DO NOT USE THIS APP, YOUR FOOD WILL BE LOST AND THEY DO NOTHING ABOUT IT. Every single other app, DoorDash, Lyft and Uber can find the correct address. Grubhub will say you have to update Google Maps which I did. Google Maps updated to the correct location. Grubhub did not update accordingly. This app and the company are pure trash. They are extremely incompetent and have no intelligence. They’re incapable of fixing their software to pull in the updated location in Google Maps and you will never get a person to speak to, they will stiff arm you with an AI bot and steal your money. They need to be terminated and put out of business immediately.",1,App Store,GrubHub
