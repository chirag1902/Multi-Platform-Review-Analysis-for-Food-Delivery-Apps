order got removed for taking too long to arrive grubhub on some bs i swear they be doing anything to make sure you don’t get a bonus. everytime i’m doing a bonus i have an issue and it’s always on the last order before getting it. was doing a mission that was earn $20 by doing 6 deliveries and only skipping 1. i got a delivery where the restaurant was 29 min away i wouldn’t normally have done it but it was the 6th delivery and i already skipped 1 so i just wanted that 20 but first the order pickup time was at 11:36 when i received the order at 11:30 but it was 29 min away then 20 min into drive i get a message saying i was running late for pickup start driving to restaurant then 2 min later it got removed.  actually some bs i’ve done orders where the pickup was 30 min away before and it didn’t do that and why tf was the pickup time 5 min after receiving order with them knowing i was 30 away. just wasted my time and gas for nothing and lost the mission and ofc support is no help them scummy indian scammers. ,2025-04-19 23:45:25,4,15,Reddit,GrubHub

"deep cuts: acceptance % while on shift if you play the scheduling game while working, you probably know that you need a 90% acceptance rate in order to receive your minimum shift pay. a lot of people think that means you need to accept 9 out of every 10 offers, and if you skip an offer, you need to hit those other 9 if you want your minimum. however it’s not quite that simple.

for instance, say you’re scheduled for a 10 hour day, which here means you would be guaranteed $150 with 90% or more acceptance.

now let’s say your day was super slow, and you took 8 offers, and skipped 1. the offers that you took were $2-5 pay for long distances, and you’re only looking at like $32 for the day unless you get that last order.

now you get the 10th offer for the day right at the end of your shift, with maybe an hour left of the night. it’s for $3, and it’s a delivery right across the street from the restaurant, but the restaurant is 12 miles away. 

since you know this will be your last order to get your guarantee, then you know that this order is actually worth $118, and so you suck it up and take the order, and you get home 45 minutes late. you wake up in the morning, and see that you have $35 for the day and your acceptance is at 89%. oops. so what happened?

well your acceptance % actually seems to be calibrated by *distance* accepted, or the % of miles you are willing to drive, out of miles offered. so in this case, your total miles driven for the day were very high, but the final order you accepted was right across the street, so it didn’t accumulate a full 10% of your miles for the day. even though you drove all the way across town to get to the restaurant, the miles counted are only between the restaurant and the customer.

so moral of the story, don’t zonk out and forget to check your % before logging out for the day, or you’ll be a broke bitch like me. good night.

tldr: acceptance % is based on accepted driving amount from the store to the customer, not the number of orders accepted.",2025-04-18 20:27:18,0,6,Reddit,GrubHub

"aita grubhub edition i'm a substitute teacher that does gig apps like grubhub on the side. i've only ever done about 5 gh orders though, as i mainly do ic and dd. i rarely order through these apps, but i missed lunch at the school i was working at and used gh to order from a place about 12 miles from the school. i usually tip around $8-10 for any orders i place, but i've been low on funds and tipped $6. in my limited experience, gh base pay was usually better than dd's, so i figured a $6 tip wasn't too bad.

long story short, i was dealing with students and had missed a text from my driver asking for the code. i told them to leave it in the lobby in the app and tried to make sure all the instructions were correct. i wasn't aware that gh requires a code now. the driver called me and i answered immediately and saw the text was from 2 minutes prior. 

i was able to see the lobby entrance from my classroom. it was a man on the profile and calling, but i only saw a woman come in with food, so i didn't think he had even arrived yet. i answered and the guy said ""this is grubhub what's the code?"" and i politely asked ""are you in the lobby?"". he said ""nah shit, what's the code"" super aggressively and i just hung up. i was already overwhelmed dealing with unruly students, and that almost sent me over the edge. i waited a minute and he texted ""give me the code or your order will be cancelled"" and i finally texted it to him. i would've given him the code immediately if he had just said said ""yes i am in the lobby"" but his whole demeanor threw me off. i got my food, but gave him a 2 star for the way he spoke on the phone.

aita here? i did some research on gh base pay later that day, and i see now that a $6 tip on a 12 mile delivery isn't that greatest tip. i will admit that i messed up not giving the code when he first texted, but i was watching out for him and he never even entered the building. i'm open to any feedback in case a situation like this arises in the future.

"driver incentive programs: ridiculous offers i don't play the acceptance rate game. but i was curious, so i did a test. since grubhub only counts the previous two weeks in our stats, i decided to see what the highest level of their program means. i did this, by only going online each week just enough to hit the highest level. now, the current week's activity does not show until the following monday. 

i noticed that as i have technically qualified but it hasn't shown up yet that the system then starts to send me outrageously ridiculous orders. orders that it never would've sent me before. i started receiving orders to go into a different city/county pick up and deliver an order for $8.00 at 20 miles. then i received another order to go into another city/county for $7 and some change for 21 miles.

i am aware that if the system thinks i am going for one of their missions then it will always offer ridiculous offers if i am getting close to succeeding. those missions haven't been worth it for a couple of years now so i don't even bother with them anymore. but if i accidentally get close to succeeding in one of those missions just by doing what i usually do then it will send me terrible offers until i no longer qualify for that mission; in hopes i will compromise and take the offer. the system does track us. 

the picture that i've attached, shows a different, absolutely ridiculous offer that it sent because come the following monday i would've qualified fully for their premier program. the system wanted me to go from the city/county where i was at into a different city/county to pick up pizza from little caesars, then travel to a third city/county and drop the little caesars off. by the way, there is a little caesars in that city where the drop off would be.

for those who don't understand, these are the games that all of the food delivery apps play when it comes to their ""driver incentive programs."" there is a psychological conditioning these companies are doing to get drivers to behave like trained monkeys. their game is to be as manipulative as possible, create hope in the possibility of more money, establish a sense of desperation and then pounce. they dangle a carrot in front of a hungry mule as they are riding on its back.

it is sad to see so many drivers believe that those programs offer true value.

edit: it's understandable that i have received negative feedback on this post. unfortunately, many who now do gig work have never experienced what back-end management in a company looks like and the factors that they consider when creating and releasing a program. the goal is always to improve profitability in the company, but when creating a program the participants must ""feel like"" there is a value in it for them in order for them to participate. these companies have shareholders, and they must please their shareholders. to believe that these incentive programs are meant to benefit the driver demonstrates a lack of understanding of what actually happens in the background.

this, of course, does not mean that a driver cannot benefit from these programs, but it is highly unlikely, in many cases, there will be a true long-term benefit for the driver.

this post is my experience; in my marketplace. there is no long-term benefit for me in that program. ",2025-04-16 19:22:46,8,25,Reddit,GrubHub

tried just waiting many times for a couple hours and nothing.  then when i finally get an offer, it's always right after a split in the road that requires a long detour because of the lane i'm committed to.  

for example, on the freeway, i just passed the exit that would have made economical sense to accept the offer im getting but now adding 10 minutes, 5 miles and rating penalty to almost every delivery.  ",2025-04-08 13:59:44,4,18,Reddit,GrubHub
"more ridiculousness... i have experienced many app glitch  issues recently of a variety of natures involving assigned orders, washout, and inaccuracy/timeliness of orders being ready at the merchant, acceptance rate tracking %, and double orders that get stuck and you can't accept and therefore you have to call 3 separate times to a sorry customer service to get released in the app to proceed meanwhile you are losing valuable orders and time.  i have also been in danger delivering to orders over the last several nights and you have to argue with customer servuce to file a report which they never due.  i have being getting to restaurants late night and tney regularly have no record of the orders.

now, these customer service jokers want you to file all this yourself which can affect your metrics and result in violations.

this all started with their recent system update several weeks ago.

let's hope the one that shows up this morning does anything but cause more issues.

such a sorry, sorry excuse for a company!!!!  with the wear and tear on the car and price of gas, you really can only do this job in certain markets.

it is fundamentally flawed and unfair and heavily schews toward the company profits and customers.  has nothing to add or help their internal customers- us drivers.  if you can do this job part time and learn to patchwork through their algorithm of lies and deceit, then only, for a short period, does it make sense....

you can never reach a supervisor and they never call back and none of these so called departments have i ever heard from via email in regards to adjustments on my account.

the last straw for me is glitches at cashout and then telling me sorry and we don't why and it should be directly deposited to your account later in the week.

you don't mess with people's hard earned money!!!!

so i finally get the order and i’m walking all the way back to my car and halfway there the person cancels the order. i had waited like 20 minutes to get the order. so of course with grubhub, i get just under $4 payment. maybe i’ll get more from prop 22..

if i have been able to park close to the restaurant, i would’ve already marked leaving by the time the person canceled.

"q: can grubhub reassign a different driver for an order or is it truly automated? if i may ask because i just want to make sure that the chat help gave me the correct info. tonight i ordered a meal from let’s say o’charley’s. someone takes the order. however, the map is showing that they drove to a restaurant location approximately 5 miles to the west of my house. the order is being prepared by a location approximately 5 miles east of my house. taking into account they may be picking up other orders, it’s still confusing as to why they would accept my order because they literally have to drive back, past my house, several more miles to the restaurant, and then back to me.

that’s a lot of driving for a simple order. i don’t know if they may have got confused and went to the wrong location seeing the restaurant name? i’m in metro atl so there are tons of drivers in the area who would’ve been a lot closer to the restaurant and me to pick this order up. could the app have given the driver the wrong location information?

either way once it became a parent that was going to take a lot longer to get the order i did chat help to see if it could be assigned to a different driver because she wasn’t even halfway to the other location yet. but they told me it’s all automated and that this isn’t possible. since i don’t know exactly how this works just curious if this is true or not?

update: driver eventually made their way to the correct restaurant but picked up a completely different customers order and brought me that customers order. chat help was no good. i was however able to reach the driver who claims she is picking it back up. called the restaurant to have them look out. i appreciate her going back if she indeed does but there’s no way to track it on the app at this point. we’ll see what happens but this particular order wound up being a real s show.",2025-03-20 19:06:55,2,15,Reddit,GrubHub

she also said - she already informed gh about it thru the app.

called gh - associate was nice to begin with but his niceness ended there. he said wait for the 2nd order??? 

i said - 1st order food might get cold and customer may not be happy. he said not a problem??? but if you want to unassign your ratings will be affected???

i used my common sense and unassigned just to take care of quality of food for 1st customer.

folks what kind of world gh is living in? - so i compromised on my ratings to make gh customer happy... even though i was premier ...

why gh is so possessive of ratings and are driver ratings more important then making customers happy?

"so do program levels even mean anything? i've been delivering grubhub here and there on the side for a couple years now but have only recently started consistently delivering each week. i learned about program levels and decided to gun for premier level, and was excited that i managed to keep everything at 100% for a week. based off of what i'd read there were a bunch of perks to being above partner level, but i haven't seen the fruits of my labor yet. 

tonight has been without a doubt one of the worst nights i've ever delivered. i kept getting orders that were roughly upwards of $8 all the way down to one order that was $2.76 for over 5 miles. there were multiple orders around the $3 range. i had a block from 7-9:30pm and right before i was set to clock out at 9:30 i got a barrage of orders. normally i would have been fine with working a little later than planned but the first order was sub-$3 from mcdonald's, the second and third order was from burger king, both for $2.98 (probably the same order thrown at me twice.) i decided to ignore those orders because i could not mentally handle that low of prices after already dealing with sub-$3 orders earlier so i ignored them, and as a result my acceptance rate plummeted.

that absolutely set me off. it felt like i was having better nights when i was at partner level. do program levels even mean anything or are they just a scam to encourage drivers to complete orders even if they're throwing $3 orders at you non-stop?",2025-03-15 22:03:25,9,22,Reddit,GrubHub

i get a lot of orders on a military base. after spending an entire day turning them down, and receiving no other orders off base, i decided to just go for it. so i started taking base orders and got into the habit of calling or texting the diner to meet me at the gate, as per grubhub policy. sometimes the diners don't want to meet at the gate so i have to call support to cancel the order. now i've noticed some support staff simply cancel the order and some tell me to mark it as delivered. they literally told me to mark the order as delivered and dispose of the food. after getting two violations for this i started arguing with support telling them i don't want to mark it as delivered because i'll get a third violation. so support staff marked the orders as delivered for me! but alas here is am with three violations and a banned account for simply doing what support told me to do. i've filed an appeal but they say it can take 14 days and that's a long time with no work. maybe after all it is my fault for doing grubhub to begin with. it seems doordash and uber blocked ordering on military bases already. i wonder if gh ever will, or renew their contract to allow us to get base access!!!

"how much do you make per delivery (on average)? do you think it's fair? hi everyone. i'm a small youtuber who is making a video about why services like ubereats and grubhub tend to be really expensive. in my research i've found that the delivery drivers really get the short end of the stick and that the company takes most of the profit.

i was wondering a few things:

- is it true that the parent company kind of screws you over?

- how important is tipping to your livelihoods?

- do you think it is worth all the effort you put in?

- what would be a better or more fair way to properly compensate delivery drivers for their time and work?

- how often do you believe you get a proper tip? 

- what is tip baiting and has it happened to you? and how do parents companies protect you from practices like tip baiting?

i'd be grateful for any and all answers. when making this video, i'm trying to be as transparent as possible and get information right from the source. 

any other information you'd like to provide about your experience as a driver or how you're treated is also welcome.

i'm sorry if this isn't the right place to ask questions! thank you all for you time and for your effort as drivers!",2025-03-11 19:42:09,10,36,Reddit,GrubHub

reason no one wants to do it here?  a downtown territory with 50 floor skyscrapers.  3 draw bridges that seem like they open hourly and a traffic nightmare i have never seen anywhere else.

so, i suck up the scraps and gladly do it.  2 months ago i was barely getting by.  today all my bill are paid and there $125 in my savings (more to come).  if i can out up with this crap for 6 months my whole financial reality qill have been rearranged in a few short months.

so, keep up the crap gh.  don't hire any more drivers and don't improve the app.  keep things exactly they way they are.

... some people thrive in chaos!

driver shows up - calls my cell to tell me he can’t get in. i walk him through the intercom. he gets in, one sec later i get the notification that it’s delivered with a blurry pic from my lobby. i texted him to ask if he is bringing it up. he says no because he is double parked.

here is the thing, my building has a driveway where you can leave your car for a few min to run up. i reached out to grubhub and removed the tip (which was more than decent - $9 on a $20 order). am i a jerk for doing that or am i in the right here? i somewhat feel bad because i’ve never done that before but this seemed pretty lazy on his part?",2025-02-27 23:51:38,6,29,Reddit,GrubHub
blocks and out of zone..? so the text message that pops up about an hour before your block starts. so make sure you have the app turned on and then you are in your zone.. now if you are already active and taking orders and an order happens to take you about a good 30 to 45 minutes outside of your zone and you do not make it back to your zone when your block starts. will you get a violation for this? i usually try not to take orders that take me out of the zone. although those are the better paying before my block starts because nine times out of 10 there's no way i can make it back when it is starting. i would really like to take these orders but i'm worried that i might get a violation for it.,2025-02-27 22:31:52,7,13,Reddit,GrubHub

"my food keeps getting stolen by the drivers with the same method i've had two orders stolen by different drivers within these last few weeks. i live in a building complex with an elevator, a guard, two automatic double-door entrances and security cameras.

i've seen the footage. the driver simply drops the bag on the floor between the two doors (after the first door, but before the locked intercom door). they take a picture of the bag on the ground and simultaneously ring the apartment number. then, they immediately pickup the bag and walk back to their car.

i've contacted grubhub and they said that without proof they won't do anything except refund or re-order for me. it takes me ages, if i'll even be successful, to get cctv footage from my building's administration, and i'm afraid that at one point if this keeps happening, grubhub won't refund me anymore thinking i'm some scammy user.

anecdote:

i've read on other posts on this sub that drivers are ""hungry"" or that its tip/wage related (not that it's an excuse). even if that were true, the foods that were stolen from me this splurge and also previous times were ""*sexy*"" foods like fast-food, fries, iced coffee, etc. when it's a vegetable soup you can bet they don't steal it. i assume someone who doesn't have daily access to food would rather steal something filling and with actual substance?

"wow!… and grubhub only holds 6% of the market!!!! uber sues doordash over alleged anti-competitive practices

uber has filed a lawsuit against its food delivery competitor, doordash, accusing the company of anti-competitive tactics that inflate costs for both restaurants and customers. the complaint alleges that doordash makes it difficult and expensive for restaurants to partner with multiple delivery services, ultimately allowing it to charge higher fees while providing what uber calls “lower-quality service.”

the lawsuit claims doordash’s dominance in the industry—holding 62.7% of the u.s. delivery market, compared to uber eats’ 25% and grubhub’s 6.2%—gives it excessive power over restaurants. some business owners reportedly feel pressured to stick with doordash, fearing financial consequences if they seek other delivery options.

in response, doordash dismissed uber’s claims as “meritless,” asserting that its success comes from providing superior service. a 2024 mystery shopper study backs this up, ranking doordash highest in customer satisfaction, promotions, and delivery accuracy. the report also found doordash had the fastest average delivery time at 26 minutes and 24 seconds, while grubhub averaged 35 minutes and 49 seconds, and uber eats lagged behind at 38 minutes and 4 seconds.

despite ongoing concerns over high fees, the demand for third-party food delivery remains strong. doordash reported an 18% increase in orders year-over-year in q3 2024, with revenue rising 25% to $2.7 billion. however, uber hopes its lawsuit will force doordash to change its business practices, giving restaurants more freedom to choose their delivery partners without fear of retaliation.",2025-02-20 04:51:01,16,34,Reddit,GrubHub

"rude staff interaction at a curbside only place. should i just let it go or maybe see if she continues to be nasty to me at the next pickup? basically the curbside only place is laid out where it's in the middle of three other buildings at a strip mall kind of place where there's three blue painted parking spots technically just for them... but everybody uses a parking spots in the row around it just for them.

but today i got a storming pissed off bus girl stomping over to my passenger side window instead of my side to snap at me for not using one of the blue parking spaces that i could not see was open. and the staff that comes out always checks every single parking spot. so naturally i just park on one of the left slightly center spaces open.

it was also that kind of ranting person where like even if you're calm and say okay and sorry and it won't happen again they just keep going for you to do it next time... she was pissed because she said this causes the restaurant to not know we're here even though like i said, every other waiter there immediately checks every car that pulls in to that row when she claims they only check for the blue spaces... she was quite the rotund lady so i wondered if that was a factor...

they also usually go up to your driver window to talk and give you the food but she just kept coming to my passenger window, further getting angry because i reclosed it thinking she'd come to the driver side with the food... then as soon as it's open again, and i reach for the bag with a polite ""thank you."" she says nothing, gives me a dirty look and  reaches in and like does a slam dunk downward toss with the food bag into my open delivery bag resting in the passenger seat! hilariously she didn't do it hard enough to do absolutely any damage to the styrofoam.

i yell back at her in a customer service ass kisser tone: ""thank you! sorry!"" and i get a loud ""do your job!!!"" that makes the people waiting in the other cars immediately look her way awkwardly. the tone she first gave me lecturing me about parking kind of felt like she herself was getting an ear-full by her boss and found a way to lash.",2025-02-15 03:42:09,3,3,Reddit,GrubHub

"i think i've noticed that a man karen diner that was probably removed from grubhub is back on a different name. tl;dr - i recognized a problem customer from a long time ago is back on a different name and using the code drop off system. i keep hearing here that code drop-offs are either for new customers or problematic customers that always complain or get refunds?

\-----

basically 2 years ago i had this problem diner where it was a weird disheveled couple where every single time i dropped off an order they would meet me at the door and then follow me to my car while one of them inspects the food and every single time one of them would step in front of my car as they complain that absolutely every single time, something about their food was wrong. then i would have to go through a song and dance every single time of showing them what grubhub said was on the order and it was always completely wrong from what they said should be on there and they'd always like keep asking me what i'm going to do about it and i keep telling them to just call customer care because it's the restaurant's fault...

this lasted for about 6 months or so and i haven't gotten an order from them up until tonight... they did the exact same thing and i recognized the house just as i pulled in and the only reason i even took the order in the first place was because it was for a completely new name- a guy's name instead of a girl's name and also curiously they now have them for a code drop off instead of photo drop off... and they held the code hostage until we did our song and dance again because their little caesars green chili and cheese pizza daring to have green chili on it and not ""green peppers"".

i can tell there's like something weird about them going on because they would just keep arguing circles with you until they got tired and went back in for 10 minutes or like they were obsessed with giving you a text saying there's a green pickup in their driveway and to deliver to the house of the green pickup then asking you once they meet you if you receive the text or not ""about the green pickup""... when their street address is just easy to get to on google maps without their weird pickup truck directions.",2025-02-13 20:41:25,4,7,Reddit,GrubHub

then when i said to please don't grab my phone and let me mark it as delivered myself, he just gave me this death glare and snapped back tat it's his restaurant and he has the right to do that...

"why do you think i should do about this really annoying stickler ""clearly son of the owner"" employee that keeps doing weird creepy commanding micromanaging (but not sexual harassment) things during pickups... basically it's this dude at a japanese restaurant where the owner is this very sweet lady and the other employees are just as friendly...

but unintentionally so this guy who's clearly the 20s son of the owner keeps basically micromanaging the hell out of how i come in and get food. such as...

\* he has to get incredibly close to you while talking to him and does this even to people he waits on. also i must show him the offer on my phone and he has to get super close to the screen and examine it like it's a tax document.

\* he has to stack everything in a great big vertical tower in the bags, including soup bowls, but then turns around and orders me on how to carry them without spilling them even though i've been there like 190 times already.

\* recently started calling me a few minutes after accepting offers to his restaurant if i'm not there on the exact time, asking where i am and if i know i even accepted an offer for his restaurant. this also happens a lot when people hot potato cheap offers in the time ​gets extended.

\* whenever i have multiple orders to pick up. he absolutely must get close to me and go ""listen, listen, look here. (i literally have to look his way and at the receipts of the bags like i'm a child at school) this is bags for \[diner a\], this is bags for \[diner b\]! you go and you give food to both customers, understand...?"" in a hasty whispery tone... confoundingly he even does this if i already have one diner's order and he hands me the next one 5 minutes later when it's ready...

what sucks is that this restaurant is really expensive so i get more than 12 bucks every single order even for cheapos ordering just a miso soup. plus i get offers for this restaurant like sometimes 3 to at least once every day. also i really hate that i'm speculating about this, but as somebody who has worked with people on the spectrum... he's giving off a lot of telltale signs.",2025-01-31 23:22:05,3,7,Reddit,GrubHub

"question for drivers i switched to grubhub from ubereats about 6 months ago (got tired of missing food not being refunded) & i have had a massive issue with drivers leaving my food on the ground. i have contactless disabled (confirmed with support & in app) & have delivery instructions stating ""do not leave food on ground. please ring doorbell"". i would 90% of my orders are left on the ground & no doorbell ring to let me know the food is here. i also tip well & based on how far away it is as well as what time of day (traffic). however, i end up messaging support & having them remove the tip because the driver didn't do the job they were hired to do. i rarely had that issue with ubereats (maybe a dozen times over the course of 5 years). what is it about grubhub that makes delivery drivers think it's ok to just drop the food on the dirty ground & leave?

eta: wow, y'all certainly went full peak unemployable here. instead of offering any kind of explanation as to why the experience is so different from other delivery services, you blamed the customer for the failure of the drivers to complete a simple task. i was feeling bad about dropping/nuking tips (why i wanted to know what was different) but not any more! if reading a few words & checking if 'contactless' is enabled is too much for you to handle, you might want to try unemployment. thank you to the few of you who messaged me or responded like responsible adults. to the rest? may you forever be without tips.

they didn’t cancel the order, a driver was assigned, and he went to the restaurant. when i saw that i texted him and said hey sorry, they told me the kitchen is closed and they’d cancel the order, and now the app won’t let me cancel it so i can’t do anything on my end.

he ended up “picking up” the order, drove all the way to my house, sat out front for a minute and then marked it as dropped off with a blurry picture from the street of the bag of food from the second restaurant, which had already been delivered.

i thought at first he was trying to pocket the tip without making the delivery… except he drove all the way here anyway. whether the kitchen somehow made the order after all or he faked the whole thing, i have no idea why he would have. does this make sense to anyone? i got a refund for order not delivered so at this point i’m just baffled, not trying to go on the warpath or anything.",2025-01-30 21:05:24,11,13,Reddit,GrubHub

"worst conditions you have encountered at a delivery i know there are some horror stories out there, but what is the one delivery that sticks with you for being particularly bad?

up until tonight, the worst i had experienced  were some hard to find houses in the middle of the woods in areas without cell service (yes those exist in 2025 shockingly). a rude restaurant or customer or long waits. but i think tonight's tops anything i have had.   
  
about 3 miles into a 1 lane dirt road that was half plowed from the snow a week ago, i notice the road seems to be staying the same elevation but the houses appear to be getting higher and higher. i finally pull up to the address as the last house on the street, but cant see much of anything as theres no lights out. i take my flashlight out to survey the scene and nothing had been cleaned from the snow, street/driveway/walkway all packed down frozen solid ice. and thats just around their car. 

in front of that are about 30-40 stairs (no railings), same conditions, i'm wearing snowboots expecting this kind of stuff so i decide i will make the climb and i get to the top, and follow the path most walked, around the corner and up the stairs onto the deck, also, still nothing has been shoveled or cleaned or salted. the stairs are so caked with snow/ice that is almost a slide getting up and down. but when i reached the top, is when it takes an even worse turn... 

ontop of the, snow/ice packed deck thats not clean, is crap. lots of it. dog crap. as if they tie their dog on the deck all day long and leave it there. i can only estimate 10+ piles littering the entire way between the stairs and the door. upon seeing this. i dropped the food, took the photo with the crap visible, and sent a long text message after i slid down on my butt to my car (yes i actually did slip and fall at one point). i explained if they wanted better service in the future, turn lights on to help find the house especially if they refuse to provide a safe and sanitary environment to traverse to bring their food and that it posed a danger to even the fittest of drivers let alone those who may not be able to physically trek through those conditions.

having delivered for ups for a few years, i was tempted to leave the food on their car and just leave but was afraid of the consequences of that. i am still disgusted by this delivery hours later. so i turn it over to you lot. whats your delivery horror story? any advice for situations like this? have you ever gotten flak for confronting a customer or restaurant? i am not sure if i should worry about being de-activated for the text message or for speaking up when somethings not right.

"hot delivery advice/etiquette i always turn off ""contactless delivery"" and put in the notes to ring the doorbell, because i'm hoping to get my food before it's cold or soggy. i can't blame a driver for a s***** restaurant or bad traffic, but leaving the food sitting outside without a heads up is under their control, right? they don't even have to hand it to me, just make sure they see me pick it up before they drive away. i'll assume you came as quickly as you could. 5-stars, good tip.

everytime, the driver leaves it on my steps without a knock or a doorbell ring.

i'm a grubhub+ member living in a typical suburban house on a wide road near the highway. my door is ~30ft from the street with no steps or hazards. it's well lit. there's even room in the driveway if they want to pull in and save 15 steps.

i reliably tip 20% or more of the subtotal (before tax), and never less than $5 (like if it's a $8 sandwich, you're still getting $5 tip for your trouble even though that's 62.5%). i enter the tip at the time of purchase, and give good driver ratings unless something is missing from my order. i don't expect them to verify the toppings on a pizza or ingredients in a sandwich (because that's on the restaurant, but if the sandwich is missing entirely that feels like the driver should at least verify the # of items, right?

am i doing something wrong? is anything i am doing unreasonable?

is there something else i can do to get a courtesy knock/ring when my food arrives?

if i'm not in the wrong here, should i reduce my tip or my review, or contact customer service?",2025-01-25 13:55:44,5,34,Reddit,GrubHub

"two digit code complaints i posted this as a reply on another post, but wanted to make my own as well so that i might get some more suggestions. 

i have a customer that i've been sent twice now. they live about 20 miles outside of my normal area, and they always have a 2 digit code. i get no response when i text them, and when i try to call i get a verizon message saying the number is no longer in service. no one answers the door either, but the second time i did notice that they have an old school camcorder set up so it peeks out from behind their curtains and can see the whole porch and driveway. i wrote a note on a spare napkin i had in my car asking them to either update the number in the app or turn of the security code option. oh, and of course they don't tip, either.

my bigger question is this: other than this customer, i've only had one other customer who i  couldn't get the code from. but each time, i can't just wait out the timer once, i have to wait like four or five times before it lets me mark the order complete. it lets me take a picture after the first time but won't give me the delivered slide until at least four times. i am wasting so much time sitting in these driveways when i could be getting more offers. has anyone else had this problem?",2025-01-25 02:26:16,13,39,Reddit,GrubHub

i sympathized, since grubhub and doordash have done this to me as a customer.  it's fine for some foods, that travel well, like pizza, but there are some foods that don't benefit from being in my car for over an hour, like french fries.

"on-time arrival problems living in a major metro city so i’m on week 2 of doing this, and so far i’ve got my scheduling commitment up to 85%, offer commitment to 68%, but my on time arrival keeps hovering at 48-52%

why?

i live in the middle of a huge metro area and i can’t control random areas of hard hitting traffic no matter what time of the day it is. and it annoys me that there is no way to inform gh that there is actually heavy traffic and it’s not me being lazy.

because of this, i have stopped doing dinner rush blocks between 5-7pm because my arrival time percentage gets killed every single time. the other day i couldn’t get for the restaurant on time because there was an accident and an ambulance blocking the road!

does anyone have suggestions? i’m not multi-apping because i prefer gh: it actually keeps me in my “zone” while delivering and the pay is actually decent on most orders. i schedule blocks 4-5 times a week to work around my current full time job so i do the best i can.

there's a sonic here that has a messed up computer, and if someone orders even one thing that they're currently out of stock on, it creates an error message on the entire order and has to be cancelled. 

for example, if they're out of m&ms, and they put in an order for m&ms on their ice cream, the entire order comes back an error and needs to be cancelled. 

always i got 2 such orders this week, called support, and support was the one that cancelled them after calling the restaurant to verify. 

i still got a violation for too many orders cancelled this week because there's an arbitrary threshold of 15% or more, and because it's been slow i haven't actually gotten many gh orders this week, so those 2 very legit cancellations that weren't even my fault are counted against me. 

has anyone successfully had one removed because all the help info seems to suggest that it's not even an option to call and dispute them, so it seems like i'm just stuck dealing with a violation that isn't even my fault.

"drivers struggle to find my place. what can i do about it? as title, my place is in a little complex. what should be a very simple drop off is made \*excessively\* difficult for the drivers, for no good reason.

while the address on the application is correct, the ""pin"" it drops for drivers to go to is way off. it takes drivers far too deep into the complex when i'm right at the front of it. 

the net result is that i end up having to watch my order like a hawk, and pray that the driver will respond to communication attempts, which half of them dont. 

i do have delivery drop off instructions that i edit all the time, trying for more/better clarity... but honestly? at this point i'm wondering if people are even reading it. i've tried all caps, practically begging... 100% of drivers go all the way to the back of the complex and spend 5-10 minutes there before either a) ditching the order or b) figuring it out. 

  
again, i'd like to reiterate that i dont live in some high rise or the like... it's not complicated, the place is literally just right there when you pull in but the marker is wrong. it's just idk how else to try and communicate or if i'm just barking up the wrong tree but i'm out of ideas at this point.

"time to take action against the on time arrival at merchant metric!!! i and many other drivers have been complaining to gh for almost two years, ever since they introduced this ridiculous on time arrival at merchant metric about the ridiculously short on time arrival at merchant metric, which is dragging all of us, who are working hard to maintain our premier level status.  here is my plan of action.  on february 8 of this year, i am invited to a ronald reagan birthday dinner, where there will be prominent indiana politicians, including the lt governor and some state representatives.  i will be calling for a law to be passed in the indiana general assembly that would outlaw the enforcement of such a metric for all trucking and delivery companies which would carry hefty fines of a significant percentage of a given companies net worth if they don't comply.  we cannot single out gh, it has to apply to all delivery and trucking companies.  i plan on also contacting the teamster's union to get the truckers on our side as it was the trucking companies that started this metric, causing truckers to get pay cuts for arriving late to pick up or drop off their loads.  i need some of you drivers to do the same in your respective states and maybe even try to get a federal law passed.

  
1) contact your state representative and state senator.  let them know that an on time arrival metric is dangerous, as it promotes dangerous driving, running red lights, etc.

2) on time arrival metrics has caused truckers to drive erratically, making the interstates more dangerous for all .

3) it is only a matter of time for a delivery driver to have an accident due to on time arrival metrics, thus causing our insurance rates to go up.

  
locate and contact your local truckers unions.  the truckers could be our best allies on this issue, and they have had to deal with these kinds of metrics for a long time, affecting their pay checks.

  
look up attorneys in your area who advertise litigation of accidents caused by these kinds of metrics from trucking companies.  

  
if we all work together, we can force gh to get rid of this on time arrival at merchants metric, and not just gh, but all delivery and trucking companies.  i will be organising a zoom call after that feb 8 dinner to get drivers organise.  feel free to leave your comments and if you wish to contact me. private message me.",2025-01-06 02:53:32,0,45,Reddit,GrubHub
"is it just me!?…or are there other gh delivery drivers that have recently started getting the most absolutely insulting $$ offers $$… (if any at all!?!?!?)  ok so today marks my 3rd night in a row, that i rejected more offers than i delivered…. aaaaand it’s the weekend!?!? friday nights offers were all so low & far and few between, from 5pm -11pm i was only given 3offers all night and all 3offers were between $2-$4 dollars!?!? i ended up making no deliveries because i refused to accept any of these 3 insulting offers! so i made no money and was in the negative now for $ spent on gas… but it had to be a fluke, right!? just a really bad night!!!??? right!? ….soooo to my surprise,i couldn’t even believe how slow last night was. a saturday night, in boston, ma… a major metropolitan city & a 24hour open market, i worked from 3:00pm to 11:30pm, hoping to make a little extra since friday was so bad for me… but ended up getting screwed over a 2nd time & even worse, not only did i only receive 5 delivery offers in those 8 1/2 hours, but to add insult to injury not even one offer was for more $6.!!!! my largest payment of the night being $5.84 for 2.9miles! which i only accepted because i was getting desperate & i low key was hoping if i at least accepted something maybe the algorithm would send me more offers!? or better offers!? ( which i now know was stupid, cause if you accept nothing for pay, then all they will offer you is nothing for pay!!!!!) now i know some people will come at me saying $5.84 for 2.9miles isn’t a bad offer at all… but working in the city most of the time all my deliveries stay within .5-1.5miles of each other all night/shift! typically (and depending on gas prices) i usually don’t accept any offers tht are less than $3 a mile minimum! my theory is tht i won’t accept any payment that doesn’t at the very least cover the price i pay for gas to drive that mile! then to top off my weekend, tonight a sunday, i worked 5pm-11pm and got, you ready for this… drumroll pleasssssse!!!!!….. “2”…. yup u heard it two whole offers all nite! i guess i should be grateful tht one offer for $6.75 because the first offer of the night i got was $2.14….. i’m just at a loss!!!! i really need the extra $ i was making w deliveries, but this is crazy!!! ….in massachusetts min. wage is &15.75, so my offers and hours should at the very least equal out to that for pay per hour at the end of my shift! ( …ohhh and gh contribution pay wants no part of having to pay is tht much, so on the very few times i didn’t make enough on my scheduled blocks and received gh contribution pay, by the end of tht week i’d be punished and have my scheduling restricted , i fought and appealed and won it back twice, but by the 3rd time it happened i didn’t feel it was even worth the fight, now i work when i want accept or reject what i want and i was happy and doing well until recently! i’ve been with gh for close to 2 years now & other than gh contribution pay screwing me out of scheduling blocks, i’ve been really happy working for them…  but now i just feel insulted… i know wonder just bought gh out,i’m just really hoping this isn’t gonna be their standard… as long as drivers accept $2 offers tho, that’s what they’ll offer and that’s who they’ll pay!!!! i just feel defeated! thanks for listening to my rant guys!!! hope your weekends paid out better than mine!!! ( ….although i did keep seeing posts that people were unable to use instant cash out at all today too…. soooo first they insult us with their pay offers aaand then they don’t even allow you ur insulting pay!!! nice!!!!! …..it just s-cks cause gh really used to be such a great company to wrk for, of all the delivery apps they made u feel appreciated & valued!!! now…. not even in the slightest!!!! ) do better grubhub!!!do better!!!",2025-01-06 01:35:40,19,28,Reddit,GrubHub

with doordash (and ubereats) you'll most often get a pickup that's at least near you with a delivery further away.

is this just how it is or am i totally missing something? are closer pickups saved for the more seasoned drivers?

the time that is given to get to many of these merchants is often times high pressure 

oftentimes parking is not readily available which is not a problem i just have to find somewhere to park legally and walk

i could be on the freeway and grubhub will send me a order and give me 7 minutes to get to the merchant (traffic 🚦 weather accidents parking ) ...

grubhub can send me an order which is located in the mall everybody knows about malls parking and navigating to the store or restaurant 

i'm doing my best ‼️💯

what are your thoughts about being on time to the merchant?

"multiple orders hi, newbie here! as i was picking up order 1 (pizza) they offered me an add on order (chinese) which was right across the street, so i accepted it. i picked up the pizza and headed to grab the chinese. the chinese order wasn’t ready, they said it’d be 15 minutes. i waited the 15, then proceeded to deliver both. this was during a mission time frame, but due to the chinese order being an extra 15 min wait, both orders were delivered after the mission time window ended. 
could i have delivered the pizza then came back for the chinese? i wasn’t sure if the app would let me do that. also, if i had said the chinese was late and skipped that order (i believe it gave me the option) would that have hurt my metrics?

"scheduling questions  so i have a question for all of you here. so i qualify for early scheduling and today (12/26) i manually scheduled myself for 3 blocks for this coming up monday (12/30). i did so without realizing i actually have an appointment that day and i can’t work that day so i removed all 3 blocks immediately. 

i’ve never actually done this before so i called gh driver support to see if there would be any repercussions and the lady i spoke to basically made it seem like i royally screwed up. she told me that i may be punished for doing that and that my schedule commitment rating may plummet. i reminded her that on the app itself it says that we have 24hrs to delete an assigned block via availability when we’re given a schedule or 30mins to delete a block we manually gave ourselves from the time we assigned it. keep in mind i dropped the 3 blocks literally 4mins after i manually assigned them to myself which is within the 30min time frame. 

she then proceeds to tell me that those are “the old rules” and that they are no longer valid. if we drop a block any time we are punished. is this true? it says on the app that i should be fine but i don’t want to lose my scheduling ability. any input would be greatly appreciated and have a wonderful and safe new year all! thank you!",2024-12-26 17:18:34,1,1,Reddit,GrubHub

"is this a glitch with contribution pay starting at midnight of a block that starts before midnight and ends after midnight? i usually do a block from 10:30 p.m. or 11:00 p.m. to 1:00 a.m. in my area. 

a lot of times earlier in the day i have nowhere near 100% acceptance rate which is required in order to get i think you have to have at least 90% in order to get contribution for any block in that day. 

however what i've noticed is if i schedule a block from before midnight that extends to past midnight, when i look at my acceptance rate for the day i have 100%. this makes sense because starting at midnight as long as i accepted anything that i received i would have 100% for that calendar day. 


but now i'm wondering when i get contribution pay for the whole block or just from midnight to 1:00 a.m. in this example? 

knowing grubhub as i do as we all do, i'm pretty sure i'm just going to get contribution pay for from midnight to 1:00 a.m. to fill in what i might not have made even though i made 20 bucks so they're not going to give me anything anyway. however i could be wrong and it might be a glitch or it might be on purpose, i could maybe receive contribution from 10: 30 p.m. to midnight, where i didn't make quite $12 an hour average. 

i'll come back here and edit this comment if i do get contribution for 10:30 to midnight even though my ar was below 80% for the day when i started the block.",2024-12-26 01:52:40,0,2,Reddit,GrubHub

by the way grubhub was just successfully class actioned to the tune of one hundred and twenty five million for predatory practices in false advertising practices in chicago.

however they got out of it by paying only twenty five million dollars with this legal gymnastic line... we cannot afford to pay the full amount because it would likely bankrupt therefore putting thousands of workers on unemployment... so they said we can't pair and because paying our employees is too expensive and cause too much unemployment.

so the store made covered the order, have it to the driver, that driver being track apparently drove 15-20 minutes to make it to my street, send a blank/black photo as delivery confirmation. but there was an error and the restaurant never got the order???

"when a restaurant tells you that you are required to make the drinks for an order: the official answer is that not only are you not supposed to make the drinks but you're actually supposed to contact support because they consider that a refusal to fulfill the customers order.

backstory: earlier this month i was picking up an order from a poke restaurant while the health inspector was doing their thing. i am familiar with the woman who was inspecting because i she inspected a restaurant i used to work at (we scored perfectly and she was really happy with us).

i ask her if they are passing and they kind of frown and shrug. they didn't pass and require reinspection this week. 

i accept an order today from the same restaurant which prompted me to google their report and see the info i just provided. poultry and fish kind of gross me out so i usually won't get it at a restaurant. so i go back to the counter when the order is ready and they hand me an empty cup for the order but i have no drinks listed. 

i took notice of this whole situation because i had 3 orders in a row that required me to return after leaving to get the bags that they forget to give me. it happens but i should have stopped giving them the benefit of a doubt sooner.

that got me thinking, we should see if there is a connection between businesses making us fulfill drinks and bad scores on health inspections. the reports are public and usually available right after inspection. i also took notice that this restaurant did not have their health inspection report posted anywhere visible inside of the restaurant, that was another red flag.

i know this was a point of contention earlier today in a post, i feel a lot of drinks i'm not trying to make anyone's day worse. but if this is a consistent thing that it may be smart to actually insist that the employees prepare the drinks. i would hate to be responsible for somebody getting sick, i know i would never find out if i did. i also feel like it's only right to let people in your community know if that restaurant is not up to the minimum standard of your local health inspectors office.

shipping almost as much as order. okay i went to order some stuff from grubhub driver section.  $30.00 worth of delivery bags. then again to the payment page and it tells me shipping could be either 24.95 for ford a day shipping or 49.95 for overnight. i'm like what the hell that is absurd i was ordering the bags because it sent me my free gift card a long time ago i never used it. is grow hub trying to trick us into thinking we really get free stuff doing good work or is the company they're going through just that greedy. if it's just the company they go through fire them already put stuff on ebay and we'll buy it there for a lot cheaper. so no new delivery bags for me i did need some because it's gonna have to go buy ones are black maybe say uber on theml. lol,2024-12-15 23:29:37,3,12,Reddit,GrubHub

driver leaves my food, i come out and it's an ubereats order with a completely wrong name and address.

i called the driver and he struggled to speak english, at one point he just spoke to a translator app and said something along the lines of ""i'm sorry, there's nothing i can do it's what the restaurant gave me""

long story short i gave him $7 for me to have to go and pick my own food up anyway because he took the bag and didn't check or confirm anything. 

what are your opinions? is his job to make sure he actually picked up the right order? is it the restaurants fault for giving him the wrong bag? should he have tried to help at all when i called him?",2024-12-14 11:26:42,13,55,Reddit,GrubHub

but nope come to find out they send the order to the location a good 12 miles from my house…
first off why? pizza will be cold and theres a spot a mile away!?!?
anyways of course i dont realize this until i check wondering whats taking so long. and below and behold the driver is driving in the opposite direction (clearly about to give me the middle finger and swipe my food)

and of course he ends up swiping it so i havw to call and get the tip removed and report him. but i feel horrible because i would havw upped the tip after delivery had i known….

the only way it works is if you put in just the name of the apartment complex... but eventually even that led you to the empty lot. and it was really sad because the customer is really polite and i know her by name by now.

also it's one of those apartment complexes where before it started fucking up, it showed her location at just the front entrance to the complex and when you got to her specific building you were too far away from the house icon and it wouldn't let you mark arrived without threatening you.

also directions around that part of town seem to be wonky in general, because i got another frequent customer where google maps keeps wanting me to drive down this alleyway too thin for a car with two pillars on either end to make it so you can't drive through it... and google just keeps making me want to make a u-turn back to the alley even if i go around a block.",2024-12-06 03:29:54,4,5,Reddit,GrubHub

"grubhub > doordash in atlanta georgia? first impressions i have been a doordash driver in atlanta for quite some time now on the side despite having multiple other jobs to support income , i primarily work on the east side because nobody has any money on the west side or they're just stingy idk but westside is always like 2$ orders so i dont go there. i finally got accepted onto grubhub after like.. a 5-7 month wait and i didnt try it out for a while, but doordash was frustrating me today because of the high traffic volume and the chik-fil-a deliveries where the wait times were like 45 min to pick up (not doing that for your 6$ order), so i decided to head over to my grubhub zone and take some orders there.

 as soon as i started. 17$ order for 6 miles!!! i took it, dropped it off and the new area i had headed too didnt have much traffic at all!! the lady who ordered was super sweet, not even my best doordash customers are that nice here. before i even left her driveway, i got another order!! 15$ for 8 miles, i took it, picked up, then i dropped it off and immediately got another one for 10$, only 3 miles. i ditched doordash entirely today bc the highest offer i ever got was 12$ for 15 miles. i did grubhub for about 5 hours and i made a total of 117$ in the sandy springs-duluth zone.. i like the fact that grubhub allows you to route multiple deliveries everytime a new one pops up which is a pretty frequent thing, the customers were all nicer and it took me mostly to suburbs with easy to locate houses. doordash in my typical zone tends to only take me to apartments, hospitals or the sketchiest addresses in the hood. i struggled to ever make 100$ in an 8 hour shift with doordash, but today i averaged 23$ an hour and there were lots of orders that i did not accept because i was busy doing other things like eating my lunch and stopping at bathrooms lmao. i never got a single order that was under 1$ per mile. my only complaints is the apps ui, its kind of ugly?? harder to navigate than the doordash app, you have to click way too many buttons just to complete each step and i think it, you also dont really get deliveries past 10pm, this is definitely a day time app, doordash might be better at night, but im up early anyways so i dont mind.

 im not sure if this will remain consistent throughout time, but i only spent around 15$ on gas today and didnt get a singular order for under 10$ the entire night, the wait times were even less than doordash which surprised me because everyone has told me grubhub wasnt good for them.. but they're also doing areas like cobb county which on doordash was only paying around 2.50-5$ on orders for high mileage and you just end up declining the majority of them. so far though i very much enjoyed the shift and im looking forward to giving it another go tmrw. grubhub seems to have a lot of gems!!",2024-12-05 23:40:09,2,5,Reddit,GrubHub

"psa: if a diner says you're allowed to park on the curb in front of a campus building with your hazard lights on and run the food to the front desk... don't! alternate psa: diner instructions are not gospel or the law; if it sounds bullshit, check with people who actually know the law of your area. then have driver care talk to the customer on your behalf.

i talked to campus parking about this for at least my area and they said i can stay in my car and have the customer come and get the food, but you can absolutely not leave your car like that or risk getting a ticket. if you're leaving your car for a campus order that isn't a dorm, need to be in public parking or try to get a visitor permit.

thankfully the diner was very polite about this. it was just a scenario where a friend of hers told her that a friend of hers was told by somebody on staff that it was allowed.",2024-12-05 17:50:02,2,48,Reddit,GrubHub

"you should actively promote non-tipping currently it doesn't seem like grubhub is in touch with reality or how to run a business.  a common saying is ""no-tip, no delivery.""  and that's the way it should be, as their delivery + service fee is often $20 and drivers don't see anywhere near enough of that.

  
therefore, you should encourage people to order from their site and tip $0 dollars, every single time.  anytime an order doesn't get delivered, it's grubhub who eats the cost and loses.  if enough people realize that tipping is an absolute scam, then we drivers will either get paid properly for our deliveries, or they'll remove and/or significantly reduce the delivery + service fees to actually allow the customer to properly tip.

  
this strategy is a win for all four parties involved, the customers, the restaurants, the drivers, and grubhub.  granted, it's a big short-term loss for grubhub, but if they hope to stay in this business they'll allow their drivers to make more deliveries, get the money they deserve, and make the useless fees for the customer either useful or go away.

  
if you want to make grubhub a place worth driving for, you'll spread this message as far and wide as possible.  it takes absolutely no thinking to understand how this is best for everyone in the long-run.",2024-12-02 20:14:13,0,9,Reddit,GrubHub

"why do grubhub drivers take way longer than doordash? so i just ordered from gh, i normally do dd because gh is almost always a bad experience. is there a reason the app says the driver is on the way to me when they're clearly making other deliveries? i always tip well, because i'm tipping in a manor of: ""this person is picking up the order i just placed and bringing it to me"" when in reality, they're picking up several orders and making several deliveries. with mine almost always getting delivered within ~3 mins of the maximum threshold. all ice melted, food essentially cold. this restaurant is 6 minutes away and it took 36 minutes for my food to get here after getting picked up. 

unfortunately i'm just not gonna tip anymore, use gh or have that tip be significantly diminished. 

is this a common issue as i'm sure drivers get most of the blame?

edit: too funny. i hope you clowns don't wonder why people don't tip you losers. i'm not sure what's funnier either, the reddit echo chamber or a bunch of people who's zero skill jobs will be replaced first by robots and ai, in a reddit echo chmaber

"has grubhub ever considered making their app for drivers functional? it's a little bit magical how grubhub's app constantly tells me that i missed two or three offers that it never notified me about.  
i can have the app on top and be staring at it.  the bell will ring, but no offer.  sometimes there's no sound or visual notification at all and yet order upon order somehow invisibly, inaudibly comes to me and i miss them all.  
do the people who run the company know how to hire an app developer?  someone to maintain and test the app to make sure it works on even the smallest, simplest level?  
do they have a budget of a few thousand dollars to pay someone to have a look at it and make it actually send notifications to drivers?  notifications that drivers can see and hear instead of the invisible, silent, background notifications that it only tells us about after the fact?  
it seems like someone there ought to want to make sure that the company's only tool for making money isn't a broken, useless failure.  i've just never seen evidence of such a thing.

"finally happened, block scheduling blocked. so a while back i saw someone mention that they got blocked for not having any orders after being scheduled on a block for 3 hours.

i wasn't sure if this would happen to me, but it did. my account history has not one single order denied, i took everything. everything.

so if you are curious, yes, even someone who accepts every single order can be blocked from scheduling because they went a scheduled time without any orders coming in from grubhub.

grubhub does not care if you have 100% acceptance rate over the career of your time with grubhub. if you go a scheduled block and do not get orders, they will block your ability to schedule blocks.

some people may say i was stupid for taking every order. i was being paid hourly, so i did not reject any orders. for me, this was just a side gig for extra money, and i enjoyed it. that's why i did it. i will not be doing it anymore. i wish you all well, and hope you all are successful with the future of grubhub.

additional information: i was not sitting at home waiting for orders. i was parked at the local mall which has several restaurants around the area that are typically sent all of our orders. the only hotspot we had was a single restaurant about 20 miles over, which usually did not get any orders. there's no guarantee that orders will arrive once you get to a hotspot.

if you are on a scheduled block and you are not getting orders, you might want to reach out to support to let them know you're not getting any orders. this may prevent the automated system from flagging you for 'abusing' the system.

"well, it's official....i got deactivated. no idea why. 

back story: got a message in app on 7/29 asking me to upload my photo id. i did exactly as requested. tried logging in several days later, and got a message stating that my document was under review, but my deadline to submit was 7/31, and the system would not let me log in. probably 15 phone calls, multiple emails to support, and multiple in app service requests later, still no progress. finally around the middle of spetember i sent another email to driver support and this time i copied the ceo in. email was very professionally worded and simply askwd for some sort of update as to why the document review was takimg so long and why nobody could or would tell me what the delay was. still nothing. sent another in october, and copied in the ceo and the vp of driver relations, asking the same questions. still nothing. applied using a different email and phone number, and got put on the waitlist for my area. assumed that the reason my login was inactive was because they had too many drivers, and that when they opened things back up, my login would be reactivated, and that they were using the id verification as a tool to weed out some drivers in the meantime. got a text yesterday saying they were taking new drivers in my area, and i was able to continue the application process. tried my old login....still nothing. started the application under my new email and phone number, and when i got to the page where i entered my dob and ssn, i got a message stating that they would not move forward with my application and thanking me for my interest. 

what a chickenshit way of deactivating drivers. i had zero complaints, a decent ar, and a completion rate well over 90%. no idea why they pulled the plug. don't really miss them, since they were the least busy of the 3 food delivery apps and i also had roadie and shippd and some other non-food delivery apps that i did. i stay busy without them on the nights i run. all i ever wanted was an explanation of what was going on....never got one. 

not surprised that they just sold for a 90% discount...it sounds like the slowdown locally was reflective of a national trend. guess it's better to be rid of them before they inevitably go balls up...if their ceo and vps are as arrogant and non-responsive to everyone else as they are to their delivery partners, they'll drive the thing the rest if the way into the ground soon enough....or the buyer will get rid of them and get people in that are competent.

the transaction is expected to close early next year, at which time grubhub will officially join wonder. until then, we’re as focused as ever on supporting you and achieving our shared goals. stay tuned for more details about this exciting time!

grubhub delivery partner team""

pictures of attention to the two words ""until then,"", meaning they're not going to support us once the takeover is complete. 

you could mean that.

""wonder is a fast-growing, food-tech startup that's raising the bar on the role food plays in peoples' lives. we're a team of food-lovers, entrepreneurs, and some of the most accomplished innovators in the culinary, logistics, and technology industries""

i checked out the wonder carrier app 500 downloads and no reviews yet on the android platform. i suspect that those are all beta testers. i'm assuming that under courier is something for package pickup and delivery and you have to go to some kind of a designated package pickup place in order to accomplish that kind of like puff puff or whatever the hell that was did you get on uber eats sometimes. 

is that what it's called? puff puff? it's been a while. 

so hoping that's not their food delivery system because i don't know what the hell hdr means but i'm imagining it's headquarters driver receiving? 

from looks at the app it's almost like it's got a caviar feel to it.

it also seems like a company that doordash would buy.

anyway was only $500 downloads that's brand new app. 

they're based in new york, so get ready for that nonsense.

"perplexed over starbucks orders it seems no matter how far from the customer for some odd reason, gh sends me to the same starbucks, even when there is a starbucks closer to the customer.  i noticed it when i ordered for myself.  gh sent the driver to a starbucks two miles away.  that wasn't bad enough.  the starbucks they send drivers to is on an insanely busy street, it is in a construction zone and very difficult to get in and out of.  every time i get a starbucks order it's to that one.  the street is so busy, i feel like i am in danger every time i go there between 7 and 11 in the morning.  

when i ordered for myself, i was very puzzled because there is literally a starbucks i could have walked to, but the driver goes two miles away.  there are six starbucks closer.  okay, i didn't go myself, because i was on the fritz, and i didn't feel like i should go out.  

and it's not just gh, it's doordash as well, they send me to this particular starbucks.  are they getting kickbacks?  

i was thinking i could get a little harness for my dog and train her to go to starbucks for me.  but, seriously why don't these services send drivers to the closest store?  i told a customer how far gh sent me to a burger king where there was one in her neighborhood, around the corner from her.  she had asked why it took so long, and i told her, where they sent me to, and she thought i was lying.

 specifically acceptance rating.  i typically accept 100% of the offers that come in to keep my reading high and while i was driving i kept hearing in order to come in but it wasn't showing up and then the app continued to glitch. 

i tried restarting it and ended up missing four orders that i could not accept, which as you know kills your earnings for the next two weeks.

we all know what it looks like, that orange banner at the top that has the word view on it and you click the word view, then you see the order. 

first of all, it's a superfluous, unnecessary, ridiculous banner. when we hear the order cowbell and pee open the app, we should just see the owner screen, am i right? 

anyway, when you hear the order cowbell, like pavlov's dog we open the app, and then you don't see the orange banner. what you do? what can you do? 

maybe i'm stupid, but accidentally clicked on the part of the screen or the upper right hand corner which it looks to me like a hand holding a star. 

i clicked on that while hearing the order cowbell, and the order screen came up, the new water screen with the reject button in the upper right hand corner and the sliding timer purple button at the bottom that says accept on it but the countdown timer counting down. 

the dollars offered in the miles total miles it'll take to complete the trip. 

under the several more times after uninstalling and reinstalling the app three times in a row. 

the orange manor sometimes appears and sometimes doesn't, but there's an orange banner the hand with the star icon is covered up, 

if there's no orange banner, just click on the little hand with holding the star, and you will see the order. 

again more ridiculous nonsense why should we have to click anything to see the order once we're in the app, while hearing the cowbell to bring us from the pasture to the trough?",2024-11-06 09:49:16,3,14,Reddit,GrubHub

"question for drivers about tip scams. i recently placed an order from a local restaurant that is a 2-3 minute drive from my house and got a text message from my driver that said, ""the order is delayed and is going to take a very long time. can you increase my tip?""

the order was delivered well before the estimated time on the app (this place is very fast and nearby, which is why i chose it), and i never got any follow-up message.

fortunately for me, i did not actually see the text message until after the delivery was made because i had my notifications off during a remote meeting, so i never responded or took any action.

is this a common thing for drivers to do? should i report on the app? does the app ui from the driver's perspective make it easy to accidently message the wrong person? i'm wondering if this is an intentional scam or possibly a misdelivered text?

""company b 227 bn"" doesn't reflect a street address, or even a geolocation in order to meet the customer at the gate.

"places you won’t go? last week i was given an order for a restaurant (not a chain) and then on my way there i was given another order for the same place, about $23 in total and not that far for delivery.   i get to the restaurant (i was finishing a different delivery) and i tell the person behind the counter “hi, i’m grubhub here with orders for brad and marc” (not their real names).   the employee then tells me “well, marc is going to be about 24 minutes and brad still has 8 minutes.  so do you want to just cancel one and do the other one first?”   i told them that they’re delivering near each other, which is why grubhub put them together.   the employee then says “other drivers will just cancel one and come back.  if we wait, then one of the orders will be cold and we’ll have to hear from door dash about how the food quality isn’t good”.  and i’m just thinking about how that’s not my problem and they should figure out a better method of operating or not partner with grubhub but unlike this person i am not there to tell them how to do their job.   so i canceled both orders on my end- told grubhub the wait time was too long- and if they give me that place again i won’t go back there.   

the two funny things of this are: i was in a block (i don’t do blocks any more) and ended up at a place where i waited literally 30 minutes for the food but couldn’t just leave because of the block deal but that’s another place i won’t go back and it’s in the same plaza as the restaurant above.  i also went down the road and got thai food which i drove around for like a half an hour because i dropped wings off along the way.  so i mean, even if i don’t take two orders and they’re made so far apart, i still could’ve taken one order from that restaurant, picked up something else and then their order could’ve been just as late (like the thai food). but, again, i’m not here to tell restaurants how to operate and from what i’ve read online people say that the staff at this restaurant are generally rude.  

will gh know not to send me back there?  do they learn?   i’ve been rejecting offers under $5 and i feel like they’re sending them to me less.  

just wanted to share how i remembered last week i was an independent contractor and walked away from a bad situation.  ",2024-10-28 11:38:59,0,9,Reddit,GrubHub

"got a violation for reassigning 2 orders this week.. didn't know that was a policy. first order was a stacked order going to mcdonalds and another restaurant. the pay was very good $18 for 7 miles. i get to mcdonalds and they can't find the order in their system. so i cancelled it. then i cancelled the second one in the stack because then the pay would be reduced without the first order and i didn't know what that pay would be so didn't want to run an order just to get screwed over money wise.

the second order i reassigned because i waited over 10 minutes and they said it was going to take another 10 so i unassigned.

seems ridiculous to get a ""violation"" for that.

"stop working for these people it's not going to get better. the only way to change it is to stop it. all i see here daily are people coping with the bullshit the gig apps do. they'll never get what they deserve because of naive people and humans in general not listening to warnings.

few ideas i've had to disrupt gh/justeats

* a picked up order app - produces false proof so you can steal food from gh
* an app that auto logs you into gh - to prevent deactivation
* auto off/on  - a feature that would turn of and on your delivery status when receiving a bad order, this prevents gh from putting you in timeout for too long
* steal food - you don't even have to work for gh.  i could make another app that generates order info quickly to look like a legit order. it would be just as easy to fool them with an image (this is the reason for the app, so they can press a button and it looks legit) but some have caught on.

thing is i don't have any energy to think about this company anymore. so much so i've been deactivated for inactivity and they won't reactivate me (probably based on past behavior of me not accepting literally everything and blowing my car up). so deuces. if i think of anything else to make gh worse for everyone i'll let you know.",2024-10-26 12:37:40,0,0,Reddit,GrubHub

"40 min to make $2 i accepted an order to drive 2 miles and make $4. so i though okay that's not far that's fine. first i waited for the order 15 minutes. no big deal, they were busy on a friday night. 

then i drive the 2 miles to the area. doesn't seem too complicated, except for when the map said i was there, only the address could not be found. the street was only like three blocks long, so i went up and down a few times. finally, i get back to the spot the map swears is it and stop and call the customer.  

customer said ""what street are you on, what's around you?"" so i explained what the neighboring houses were like and how the addresses all lined up except hers. as in the addresses were all 141...and hers was apparently 140...but the street ended at a 141.. address. 

then she said ""well i don't see anyone outside my house"" well yeah because i can't find it. that is literally the point. she gave me a vague direction by saying there's a certain car outside the house. and mentioned how a lot of drivers have a hard time finding it.

so i drove around again looking for the car. nothing. at this point it's been about 30 min or so. i call support and they put me on hold to call the customer. who doesn't answer the phone. now if it were me and i knew my delivery driver was lost i'd answer the phone. 

at that point, after two calls, the support person cancelled the order and i got $2. ten minutes later my phone rings and it's the customer calling through support to ask where i am....um at this point i am back home because that whole thing annoyed me. 

i'm sure they are complaining to someone about how i stole their food. the irony is, it was cold and food i wouldn't eat anyway. 

i can always find the house. i've been driving since way before google maps. i know how addresses work. maybe they should write out some actual directions next time. ",2024-10-18 23:59:43,13,51,Reddit,GrubHub

"can’t cancel blocks without penalty even tho i’m sick so i just got off the phone with driver care and they won’t remove my blocks without penalty even tho i was just diagnosed with an upper respiratory infection, had a chest x-ray, am very symptomatic, and have a fever. i asked if they would rather me go to work while i’m sick and symptomatic and they essentially said yes and reiterated that they cannot remove blocks without penalty. 

so either i’m being punished for canceling my blocks and not working while i’m sick or i’m taking a major pay cut by canceling multiple blocks over this weekend which will impact my status in the system and bring me down to near entry level. i depend of this job. i have bills to pay. this is my primary source of income rn. i don’t live in a huge city, offers aren’t just flowing constantly like in big cities i kinda have to play their stupid game. 

but the fact that grubhub is forcing me to risk my health and other’s just so i can be able to pay my bills this month is insane. absolutely fuck grubhub i hate this shit so much.",2024-10-18 17:06:32,3,42,Reddit,GrubHub

"am i misunderstanding gh contribution? so on tuesday i worked blocks from 11:00 am until 6:00 pm.  i went available early, i went unavailable a little after 6 and stayed available the entire time.  i stayed within my region and had a 100% acceptance rate.  

at the end of the day, i had made $80 and change in total but the grubhub side of that was only $39.96.   (the rest was in tips). i was under the impression that the grubhub side would then correct itself to being $70, as i’d be getting $10/hr for being in a block.  that means grubhub should’ve given me another $30.04 or am i misunderstanding how this works?

i also must admit that i a) took an order for around $4 which had me driving way too far because the customer didn’t tip (i would have ignored it if i wasn’t in the block going for the 100%) and i also was doing nothing from 3:30-4:30pm because there were simply no orders.  if i wasn’t in a block i would have gone unavailable but i felt tied down to being in the block.  

this whole thing has really soured my idea about blocks because i feel like i didn’t get my guaranteed pay as i understood it to be and i also felt like i’d be getting more orders when i also sat from 12-12:30 and had none. 

while i realize not every day can be the same, in contrast the prior tuesday i went out from noon until 6- a whole hour less- and made around $100 and i wasn’t in a block. i also went unavailable for about an hour or so during that time to go to goodwill.   

i see a lot of discussion with people on both sides of the fence about blocks and based on my one day using them i don’t think they’re worth being tied down.  the best part of this job is that you can just go unavailable if the day sucks or you get diarrhea or something.  but when you’re in a block, that can’t happen.  so, for me, even if grubhub gave me that $30, i’d only had made $10 more than last tuesday when i wasn’t available for as long and wasn’t in blocks.   

but am i understanding blocks correctly in the way that they are based on the grubhub pay and don’t include tips or is it that i made $80 on the day with tips and that’s more than $70 so grubhub kicks in nothing? ",2024-10-17 10:24:19,5,20,Reddit,GrubHub

"thinking about driving part time i'm not sure exactly why, but reddit started showing me posts from food delivery app groups. it got me thinking...

long story short, i just took a new wfh role at my current employer that is salary and partially tied up in quarterly bonuses, and even though it should be roughly the same as my old hourly position at the end of the year, the day to day pay is lower. 

so i'm considering doing some food delivery a few nights a week to pad the ol' checking account. at least until i can catch up with with a couple or few bonuses. 

is it worth doing this as a part time, probably short term gig with the understanding that i don't need to make a living at it? i live on the edge of a city with a large-ish population and plenty of participating restaurants. i have a new vehicle that gets 23-25 mpg. gas prices are around $2.75/gal. 

my previous job involved driving to places around the state, frequently following vague and sometimes impossible instructions with incorrect or incomplete contact info. so none of that worries me. 

any insight would be appreciated. ",2024-10-13 22:59:44,3,7,Reddit,GrubHub

"looking to reimburse a driver a store canceled on in florida! this is a long shot but i am trying to find a driver named asia who was going to deliver an order in seffner, florida from a chinese restaurant. the restaurant canceled the order because they said they decided to stop accepting orders, but it was over an hour after the order had been placed so a driver had already been dispatched and was nearly there before it was canceled. (it had been marked as ""working on it"" the whole time, and they had updated the delivery window as well.) 

i don't care about the food but the whole area was hammered from the hurricane and i know gas is hard to find. it looked like she came a long way for it and i feel really bad she got stiffed on a tip. if she sees this (or if someone knows her) i would love to cash app her the tip she would have gotten for her trouble. i don't know her last name but i remember the photo she had in the app, and of course i have the name of the restaurant the order was supposed to come from as well. hoping she or someone who knows he sees this and can reach out. thank you!!!",2024-10-12 20:44:01,22,9,Reddit,GrubHub

me: i understand your tech team is working on the issue, but the drivers shouldn’t be liable or punish for your system issue. i have never denied any orders including the $2.00 orders to build up my metrics. 
grubhub: i understand your frustration, but we unable to edit the metrics. you can submit a ticket, but the tech team is unable to edit the metrics. you can also just work off the schedule and build up your acceptance rate for the day. 


so grubhub wants me to work overtime off the schedule to build up the acceptance rate. when they just been sending me $2.00 base pay orders all day. even after completing six orders off the schedule the acceptance rate barely increased. i understand grubhub only care about their  customer, but at least express some respect for the drivers and their hard-work.

"i think i figured out why my id documents have taken 8 weeks and counting to get reapproved. last week of july, got a message in the app (while i was on a delivery!) asking me to submit photos of the front and back of my id. thought that was weird, since my license was nowhere near expiring, but sent them anyway. tried logging in 4 or 5 days later, and got a message that my documents were under review and it should be a couple.of days but the due date was 7/31. i couldn't get past that screen. called support, got scripted, can't connect to that group, we'll start a ticket, can't elevate to a manager, just have to wait. countless phone calls, emails (even including the ceo and chief experience officer!), and online help requests later, we're at 8 weeks and counting of no progress (or even an acknowledgement that the issue exists). 

so today i decided to try to create a new account. lo and behold, drivers are waitlisted in my area! 

looks like the id thing was just a way to cull the herd of existing drivers....i had noticed that the number and quality of gh orders had dropped off dramatically before all this happened (i normally have  gh, ue and dd all going at once, plus roadie and shipt), and gh might have sent me 2-4 orders over the course of a 5pm-10pm shift (off block). i'm guessing they approved way too many people at the same time their market share locally started dropping. good thing the other 2 apps seem to be doing well.....i really haven't seen any appreciable revenue impact from getting relegated, but it would be nice to still have that arrow in my quiver.

“i'm new to grubhub. my very first delivery last thursday, the lady gave me the wrong address to the hotel she was staying at. i delivered it to the wrong hotel and then got a text from her saying it wasn't delivered properly. i apologized and went back for it and told her i was on my way to drop it off at the correct hotel. she was completely understanding and apologized for giving me the wrong info. 5-10 minutes after she acknowledged my message that i was on my way, i got a notification that she cancelled the order and to not deliver the item. y'all know how it prompts you to not deliver if an order is cancelled. so i kept it and then continued to my next pick up.

yesterday, i had a lady place two separate orders at the same restaurant. i thought maybe it was an accident because it was the same exact item. i picked them both up and delivered. at first, i delivered to the wrong building in her community. when i submitted the photos, she called me immediately and directed me where to go. she met me outside and i hand delivered the order to her, but i was unable to submit a photo because i had already done so. about 10 minutes later i got a notification that both those orders were cancelled.

i'm assuming this is the reason i have a violation but can anyone explain to me why?  the app quite literally won’t allow you to deliver if you are at the wrong address based on the gps so it’s complete bullshit. i called customer service and of course they were no help. i was told the violation will fall off after 90 days. but i don't want this to be a reoccurring issue and possibly get more false violations and then my account gets deactivated. anyone experience this as well? any suggestions on what to do to prevent this from happening again?”",2024-09-24 13:59:17,1,7,Reddit,GrubHub

"to susan who ordered from spicy bangkok in allen park, mi... why the heck do these customers cancel their orders after a driver accepts to pick it up?? 

i just accepted this order on my way back to my area after delivering another one outside of my area. i take 94 which is out of the way from my area, but in the direction of the restaurant of course. 

i am half way there and i see the order was canceled. 
it just peeves me off that the customer doesn't cancel the order while waiting in the queue for it to get picked up by someone. 

you wait until someone is on their way. and we don't get paid at all and  i wasted my gas.

"why grubhub is so unprofessional ( or are they ) ? - no wonder they can't pay the drivers appropriately after losing money everyday... did 4 orders yesterday. was multi-apping with shipt.

i could mark arrived for 3 of them. surprisingly the mall ( pretzels ) order ( $11+ for 7 miles ) did not allow me to do so??? - tried moving around the restaurant in the mall but no avail.

restaurant did not have the order. she took my phone & completed the order.

kept on getting crappy ' you are almost there - blah blah blah'

so after picking up - called gh - she apologized in broken english...

and while i was talking to her and about to start driving to the customer, gh unassigned me because i didn't move to the restaurant???

ended up with a ton of auntie ann's pretzels which i am not a fan of... and no pay for all the efforts - like parking far away due to unavailabity, walking back & forth to the car, waiting because restaurant didn't have the order & finally interacting with gh support.

also arrival/completion ratings got trashed ( i don't care anyways being a partner - lol ) - but if it happens frequently then violations or even decativation could come into play...

on the other hand - gh lost money because they trust customers 100% - no matter what - so instant refund... gh doesn't investigate food not received claims as well - just refund because its drivers' fault 100%  - they are bad people and can never be trusted... 

they have to be penalized day in & day out - no matter what ...

they lose ton of money on their unprofessionalism everyday  - so what is the solution to recover lost money ? -  cut the driver pay...

to be fair to gh - i made big money in the past with gh and still love gh ( not as much though ) and i sincerely hope i am wrong...

"out of retirement posting to say, ""worse fear happened"" dog attacked me.  currently things are still in the process of being handled. even grubhub is currently investigating the incident. 

what happened:
i was delivering a customers order which was a cherry slurpee and a box of pocky. i get to their house and notice there dog was very aggressive. i'm talking pushing the vinyl gate outwards. i see this and proceed to text the customer the macro, i've arrived. the gate opens up and i'm standing there with the order thinking ""maybe the dog is put away."" dead wrong. flying out of the gate is a large german shepherd. proceeds to go after me gets my hand, elbow, side and lastly my leg. i fall to the ground. as the dog barely gets to my leg. a teenager who lives there pulled the dog off and took them inside. apologized for it and i got off lucky. 

the dog barely did any significant damage my hand hurts a little bit. so did my side and left shoulder from the fall. currently, i have reported it to the local animal control, i'm awaiting a incident report number to file a police report. i did let grubhub know and i'm not doing any more deliveries to that house. i'm also awaiting to hear back from them as far as their investigation. they sent an email asking for all the information. including the medication i received in the urgent care. i do plan to go as far as possible with this. i know it's an accident and apparently as the customer said ""my brother is in a wheel chair and opened the gate."" i don't know how true that is. figured i'd post this for the sake that it might be helpful. 

especially since i was on grubhub's time and they have accident insurance. i'm curious how this is going to go. i told my mom i'm going to be pissed. if they send me a $100 gift card. if that. i'm sure i'm getting a ""oh we're sorry for the inconvenience that happened to you."" 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤬🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬",2024-09-21 16:15:25,4,19,Reddit,GrubHub

"there has been a freaking weird influx of rude know-it-alls just swooping into the subreddit telling us how to do our jobs in ways that clearly show they're not even drivers. like one of my threads keeps getting an influx of people saying that i didn't read the instructions on the order i was complaining about ​and should have rejected the order...

when i did read the directions and just thought they were absurd and wanted to share it here. plus they act like we can somehow see ​directions before we even accept the order.

granted it was for a stupid order i never should have accepted. but just that i was literally right there a block away from the restaurant and a 2-minute drive from her. and i wanted to tell a funny story for what i now know is a gaffe that that lady does to make herself look like a good person for not tipping...

basically i asked around and she always orders something, waves a 20 in the driver's face and say that something went wrong so he's not getting the tip. but then for some reason in comes gaggle of people that act like they're from her fan club and kicked her puppy on the way or something.",2024-09-21 00:12:13,7,6,Reddit,GrubHub

"help! my phone is on the outs  okay y’all so i’m frustrated. i have an iphone 12 mini, had it for 2 years and while i was working last friday for gh i was caught in a major downpour that came out of nowhere. i got drenched to the bone and unfortunately so did my phone. it still technically functions but water got into the charging port so i can’t use a regular charger (i’m borrowing a pad charger to get by in the mean time). the battery is also starting to overheat when i run 2 or more apps at a time (which i have to do for this job) and is draining more quickly. it would be super expensive to fix so i’m thinking i may just turn it in and get another one.

i’ve been on a plan with my family my whole life and i’m in the process of distancing from them financially. really needing advice on what would be a good value for someone in school 4 days a week and driving gh as primary income. i’m talking single line, can be pretty basic, works well with the apps needed for work, and won’t k!ll me financially.

"gh vs dd opinions?  been doing gh for about a month now and just started dd today. i'm curious what everyone's opinions are on the differences. 

gh i like because i can throw it on whenever i want to earn a few bucks. so far with dd it seems to be on a per need basis. i can't just start it and go. it either needs to be busy or i have to schedule. it also stopped me when the area i was delivering in was no longer busy. i do have more choices with dd as far as area though if i want to travel around my state.

so far with dd i haven't received any double orders or got any orders when i'm in the middle of a delivery, which means i'm sitting around waiting more or chasing hot spots. but i haven't received any lowball orders yet like i seem to get a lot of with gh. everything has been over $1/mile.

the interface for gh seems a lot quicker on my phone. loading everything up is almost instant where dd takes 5-10 seconds to load up. i do like that the navigation is built right into the app instead of bouncing between the two with gh. 

so i'm curious what everyone's opinions are. do you find it worth it to go between the two or do you stick with one or the other? do you find one tends to pay better? also, for those with experience using dd, am i better getting paid by the order or by time?

after i didn't get paid, i called them again. while speaking with the rep, i noticed that my bank account number was changed that day i got that complaint. so grubhub is escalating the information, but this is nuts. not sure if it was a mistake or a rogue grubhub employee. but this whole thing is insane.

"got a double order where order a was ready and the manager asked me to go deliver it and come back for b because sushi. asked driver care to mark order a delivered and she marks order b delivered instead and then tried to turn around and say it was my fault. got two orders simultaneously for a local sushi place. molina and sabrina. molina ordered just two raw fish rolls ready and already waiting for pickup, while sabrina's was a big dinner and would take 25 minutes.

the manager walks out and asks me nicely if i can go please deliver melina's order first since she's a 3-minute drive away and back and because it's raw fish. so i get to melina's house and i find the new format of the app doesn't let me prematurely mark one order as delivered or even take a picture...

so i get on the phone with driver care with of course the thickest hindi accent person i've encountered on this job yet... while driving back to the sushi place i explained to her that i already delivered to \*​molina\* and that i'm going back to wait for sabrina's order. i repeated about three times that it was molina that was done. dc lady kept being confused and asking if i wanted to unassign an order, or the diner or the restaurant wanted to cancel, or that i couldn't complete sabrina's order. all while both chickens and a baby crying loudly were in the background on her end. 

by the time i was in the parking lot she said she finally got it and that she would mark the order as delivered... she marked​ sabrina's order instead after i told her four times emphasizing ""molina is delivered!""...

i tell her she marked the wrong orders delivered and i was going to deliver that order and that i told her multiple times that it was the other order... she's deathly quiet aside from her baby and chickens for a long time... then asks if i was trying to prematurely mark an order de​livered without completing it. i just replied back that i know these calls are being recorded and that i told her that she marked the wrong order as delivered... and she just hangs up.f

i finally have to call driver care immediately again while i'm being sent to another order to a kfc and burger king. this time it's a hindi accented guy who knows his stuff and it's just as flabbergasted as i am and says that he has my previous driver care collar on record and will make a complaint and that he also canceled sabrina's order so it doesn't look like i stole it... still got the full amount + the $13 sabrina was going to tip me anyway... oops",2024-09-13 09:38:43,0,11,Reddit,GrubHub

i need to monitor it the next order i get, but it feels like it goes down anyway unless the food is magically already ready and you leave before the arrival time is up.

after dropping them off i called and as i'm on the phone they canceled the add on and i didn't get paid for it. support said the system recognized it as a duplicate (nearly 40 minutes later after i had already dropped it off) and canceled it. i fought them on it. they told me to submit the request form through the app. i have no proof of the add on since it doesn't show up in my orders tab due to it being canceled. i've had discrepancies with pay here and there over the last 4 years but i think this is the last one for me. i was told to deliver them both and did so only to not be paid for one of them. any other company would lose their ass for shit like this.

"20 deliveries in 14 days to go from entry level to partner? i contacted grubhub support, and they informed me that my stats are not updating because i haven’t completed 20 deliveries within 14 days.

i initially thought this meant 20 deliveries in total. this is very difficult to achieve, as in my market they rarely send me any deliveries, and the ones they do send are often poor. the most i’ve managed is 6 deliveries in a weekend, and even then, i was pushing myself to reach a total of 20, since most of the deliveries were terrible.

this expectation from grubhub is so unrealistic, especially given the low volume of orders they offer.

i can't even get this done, because even if i take all the bad orders i'm not even sure they will send me enough to get 20 done in 14 days.

it should be 20 deliveries in total, not within 14 days.

been doing dd and ue for almost a year now, finally got off the waitlist for gh and did my fist shift today. already think it's worse than the other two. rejected 39 out of 41, most of which were high miles going out of my area. dd is where i make most of my money and ue is just a filler for when dd is slow. i guess gh will also just be a filler. the things i already dislike about gh:

  
1. can't pause the app. just seen in the app that when you're on a scheduled block you can only take one 10 minute break every 2 hours. hell no, i am an independent contractor, not an employee, you ain't telling me when i can and can't take a break.

  
2. stacked orders. i see gh has gone the way dd. 90% of the offers they sent me were stacked and some of the pick-ups and/or drop-offs weren't even close to each other. at least dd and ue keeps them pretty close together.

  
3. getting offers while driving to a drop-off. gh opens the map app when navigating and i missed a bunch of offers because i couldn't navigate back to the gh app to view them. i ain't trying to do all that while i'm driving.

  
4. offers going out of my zone. i live in a big college city. on dd and ue if i get a good paying order to one of the smaller towns outside the city i can usually catch an order from one of the mom and pop restaurants going back to the city. with gh i would have to drive back to my zone before receiving any more offers, meaning a lot of dead drive back. it would have to be really high paying for me to that.

  
if anyone has any tips on how to utilize these dislikes better, or any others tips regarding gh, id be happy to here them and thanks for reading my long ass rant.",2024-09-06 20:31:42,6,29,Reddit,GrubHub

"how i found out if a place intentionally delays gig orders or place them on the back burner by ordering the exact same things in line and getting it ready before the dispatched gh or other gig order comes out. and this applies if you let them know about your gig order first before placing your order. i remember arriving exactly at eta yes i was dispatched early. i remember a fast food type place say they are busy and it will be ready in 8 minutes. but when i place the exact same order i get it in around 2 minutes what’s up with that?

but at least gh didn’t auto unassign when i decided to wait until my arrival is around eta otherwise i would had been be really angry. anyone done this before? i am thinking it’s not impossible for one to have table service for the same food and finish it and pay the check before the gh order comes out of the kitchen.

"grubhub online time after getting blocks reinstated? it’s interesting i noticed that after gh reinstated my blocks after years of hiatus, i noticed something interesting, my market is pretty dead anyways though most of orders i get seem to be late night or early morning otherwise i pretty much get nothing. so i log on at night around 9 and schedule 11-1am as well as 5:00-7:00 or 8:00 am and i did log off to sleep between 1 - 5am however i still get kicked off at ten even though i had 4 hours off two are closed hours anyways between 9 pm and ten am.  thus only 8 online hour in total keep in mind zero time actually worked and i didn’t schedule blocks at night. it appears with blocks they count all the hours starting from going online doesn’t matter one logged off or the market closed in between for two hours.

i am thinking they programmed the policy this way to punish cherry pickers. it appears only uber actually interpret to the full letter of drive time not idle time. 

gh seem to count online time to the ten hour cap doesn’t matter whether one receives any jobs let alone accepted and worked the job. so when orders finally comes one gets cut off by log in hours limit. alas gh is the only one that is getting orders at all dd almost nothing these days.

"getting it out of my chest  i worked at driver care and driver payment for grubhub a couple of years ago, and i have always wanted to make a post about this. 

firstly, i want to point out something obvious but still needed; as this was a couple years ago,, i am not 100% sure if things are still the same, but knowing corporate, they probably are. 

now, i am not sure on how to start this, but basically, and without the intend of being harsh, you guys should value yourself more and fight for better work conditions. 

i consider myself someone really empathic, and to be honest it was complicated having to deal with a job where you are suposed to support, but you are really not helping at all even if you want to. most helpful stuff you could do was getting the restaurant to remake an order lmao. driver care is there 50% of the times to deal with driver's complains. 

the majority, if not all, of the of the processes that are followed by customer and driver support are driven towards retaining the customer at all costs. it is stupidly insane the amount of money that these guys are willing to spend just to retain the customer when they have a ""bad"" experience. 

for example, if a customer got their order cancelled, they would get a $10-$20 coupon, while you guys literally did not even got paid for going to the restaurant or driving crazy amounts of time. like, i am not saying customers should not be compensated when that stuff happen, but they can easily do a $5-$10 each, but they just don't.  

when i was at driver payment, 95% of my work was denying payments for canceled orders, mileage adjustments, etc. we almost never did any adjustment, and if we did it was $1 tops. my advise is, don't event lose your time and energy with trying to get a pay adjustment for an order lol 

also, corporate and the higher ups have really no idea of what the actual fuck is going on or what are you guys experiencing there in the field. i remember being called for meetings to kind of keep them posted and it was hard for them to understand some stuff because they were clearly not interested in knowing what is really going on.

summing up, don't forget that you guys are who is keeping the company running, not the customers, nor the clowns in suits that are there just scratching their asses. you guys are doing the deliveres, you are dealing with the traffic, customers, annoying restaurant employees, etc. they are nothing without you, and if you guys trully organize, you could fuck them up or at least get better conditions. 

i know changing the way thing works is hard, but in the meantime, do not get crazy about your rates and just take whatever orders you feel like and that will make your day easier while redituable. most of the times you won't get paid more if you do what they want you to, and the benefits are minimal.

something else that i would like to add is that,, i know most of you all are tired and having a tough day when you pick up the phone and call driver care, but don't forget that the guy or girl on the phone is algo a human trying to do their job, and probably while having a shitty day too, so be kind. 

finally, i just want to thank you all for everything. of course that i don't know anyone in the sub, and no one will recognize me, but i am sure that i must have worked with at least one of you guys, and i hope i made your day easier back then, even if you do not know or remember me.

"what’s the purpose of scheduling blocks these days, and how gh calculates ca prop 22 time limits. interesting as it appears nowadays they don’t compensate for complete lack of orders anymore during a block period as unlike in the past it’s not possible to take advantage of blocks pay doing low demand times when gh might not send  any orders. i remember any order not taken would wipe out any chance of gh compensation anyways.

i be curious what is the purpose of having blocks these days anyways especially in markets with minimum pay for active time anyways. does it give order priority? as it’s very slow these days as people are fed up with high fees for worse quality service.

i remember back in 2019 on a slow night they send me a low paying order 20 miles one way away which i turned down that night close to end of shift they took away all ghc for that day. that was back when they paid ghc if all orders were taken which including if gh didn’t send an order throughout the block. 

also, unlike uber, which only 
calculates active hours and or moving more than 10 miles per hour while looking for ride requests or orders as the prop 22 language does say “logged in and driving” i noticed gh tends to calculate anytime logged in as well as scheduled on blocks regardless one actually worked or driven at all either logged on or on block. it appears there strategy to interpret prop 22 this way is to get cherry pickers off line. nowadays blocks are only available late night or early mornings anyways.

another is pratyak who lives in an apartment complex or his building is in the middle where no parking lot is nearby and he's on the third floor. he always perks from his cracked door and waits for you to descend the stairs before grabbing his food and he was way more obvious to put on my blacklist because he'd always order far away dinky fast food with no tip.

one more is larry... he tries ordering food with precise amounts of random sauces that are always way too much for the meal he orders. he apparently lives in a motel 6, because the first time i thought he was just a cheap ass tourist but i keep getting offers for him every year.

the weirdly most egregious one is steven because the first two times i did his order he lives in a duplex and looks just like harry knowles and he comes out to get his food and acts all polite but him and his premises always reeks of marijuana and he is always visibly high. he tried an order every single day for three weeks.",2024-08-31 01:06:56,14,54,Reddit,GrubHub

"what’s the deal with grubhub’s owya and its history? if appears nowadays it’s only for shop and pay orders

fortunately unpartnered restaurants are out due to the mormetarium on violating unpartnered restaurants menu copyrights.

they joined the owya card fad right before lockdown abruptly. 

it appears for postmates and doordash originally when they started they had the card as standard payment procedure as automated tablet payment haven’t been rolled out yet across all their partners yet so it was a bandage solution. though eventually they find it an idea to get to deliver non participating restaurant orders. 
it appears gh started later and only after partnering with restaurants long before they had deliveries thus they didn’t have card initially. 

i still remember one restaurant getting mad at me for calling in a owya order instead of ordering at counter, that place had a super long line at that time just because they saw the card . i immediately cancelled after they became aggressive towards me. yet they stilled called me every 15 minutes to try remind me to pickup and pay but i had to insist it’s not my order, i eventually had to block their number. anyone have stories on this?",2024-08-29 21:42:18,2,3,Reddit,GrubHub
"guaranteed pay is a scam!  i've been driving for gh for almost 4 years now in hickory, nc which isn't a huge city like charlotte, but it's a pretty decent sized area and i used to average around $120 (i know that's not a lot in larger markets but around here it's pretty good) in an 6-hour shift. i've only a couple of times had to take the guarantee pay. today i was on a scheduled block from 7am-12pm and by 11 i'd had one total order for $13.76 which itself is strange because thursdays are usually extremely busy. another order showed up for a new restaurant i'd never heard of which i accepted, hit navigate, and headed to the location. when i got there i switched back to the app and the order was gone. i looked in my order history to see if it was cancelled and it now showed it as a missed order. i called driver care, the agent i spoke to said that he could see that i had accepted it but that it had been reassigned for some reason almost immediately after i accepted and said it must have been a glitch in the system and that he'd get it fixed so that the missed order would be taken off of my history. fast forward to this evening i go check my history because i'm still getting no orders even though i'm available and sitting in a large hot zone (yes i know they're bs) and the order has been put back on my history and my acceptance for the day is now at 50%. i called driver care back and the agent i spoke with said that she couldn't fix it. i asked to speak to her supervisor because i could hear them in the background coaching her on what to say, to which she blatantly lied and said the supervisors are in a meeting for 2 hours and to call back then. this stuff is getting out of hand. how are we supposed to be out here making money but they can't bother to give us the orders? i went to three of my regular restaurants just now and they said they've got all kinds of grubhub orders in and nobody coming to pick them up. how are we supposed to go pick them up if we're not getting the orders make this make sense to me.

"have you ever had any stories of really nasty or just bad driver care calls? like where the person was being weirdly unprofessional or straight up lying to you or just acting like a robot and reciting every canned response with no original thought? did a cvs grocery order delivery for $19, but the store had all the pills in weird places with different prices. i called driver care because none of the barcodes worked for the item the guy wanted or his substitutes. but at every single moment, this power tripping asshole went into a blatantly canned phrase of ""so are you saying that you are unable to complete this order, because that gives me grounds to unassign this order with a penalty!"" in a very accusatory and oddly monotone voice like he was a cop pulling me over and reading options for my ticket or my miranda rights.

like it sounded like he does this at every call possible so he can hang up as fast as possible, because the first time he did that he went straight for it in the middle of my explanation of what was wrong.

i just kept trying to keep defusing him from doing that about three times in a row while he had absolutely no idea how the shopping menu even worked; like he didn't know there could be substitutions or that i was scanning barcodes. all i needed him to basically do was ​finagle the menu back because i found the original item and it wouldn't let me go back and say i did. ""so are you saying that you have messed up the app by your own fault? because if you have, i have grounds to unassign this order with penalty!?""

i finally got mad and told him not to do anything, i'll just press ""submit item anyway"" then he cut me off asking ""so you are saying you're committing fraud by attempting to purchase the wrong item with your driver card!?""

"grubhub sending orders far away from customers without them realizing it there is a restaurant  i always order from just a mile from my house. i assume that’s where i was ordering since previous orders came from there. today i placed my lunch order and it showed on the map my order coming from a location in a different city which i know is about a half an hour away in traffic. i feel bad because my tip is based on the mile-away location, and i also don’t want to eat cold food. the grub hub won’t cancel despite my immediately trying to cancel when i noticed this.  i just wanted to point out that when drivers see orders that don't make sense, it could be that the customers don't even realize where grubhub is routing their orders.  i thought i was being nice for leaving a $8 tip on a $16 order from 1 mile from my house, and now it's an 8 dollar tip to deliver from a different city in rush hour traffic which could be a half hour of driving one way and i'm getting screwed because gh won't cancel it.   multiple drivers accepted the order and later canceled it despite waiting some time.  the delivery estimate is 1.5 hours from when i placed the order.

i chatted with support and they said they would contact the customer and don't hit got order or leaving (as usual). then they cane back and said to mark the order as fulfilled. i said i don't believe that i can do that. (fulfilled?)

they ended up marking the order as delivered and i got full pay?!?  not complaining but just strange. i expected the order get canceled and get screwed on payment.

my second issue is that after that, i continued delivering, and from the rest of the money i earned today, only $7 is available for cashout. at least this amount shows up in the statement, so i hope it will appear in my weekly statement. but after the first order disappeared, i'm not sure what to think.

"my $20 cash tip guy let me down… i’ve spoken about this customer before - he’s prepared to cash tip $5, $10, or $20 cash, completely dependent upon the level of service 

did you get lost, is your attitude good, food handling, etc

i’ve always gotten the $20

i got a run to his place, saturday night, and gh decides to jam a second offer in front of him

i assumed he’d be okay, texted him to let him know… no usual “hey great, thanks” or whatever 

when i dropped off his food, he met me out front as usual, but with very little interaction took his food and walked away 

no tip

at all 

i think i might have actually stood there blinking for a long time 

there was a clear message here

“when i order first, i want to be first”

and he’s entitled to that

was he wrong to punish me, this way? not completely  

he has every right in the world to use his money to influence the service he’s provided 

and i had a choice - accept or decline the second offer - plain and simple 

how will i do it in the future? 

i’ll have to decide which pieces of this puzzle have what “value”

starting with my stats, are they worth twenty bucks? for me, no

is this customer’s satisfaction, and twenty bucks, worth more than my stats? not sure…

is this customer’s satisfaction and twenty bucks, worth more than my stats and the other $12 offer? no, hard no!

his twenty dollars worth of bargaining power just dwindled to $8…

i have to work way harder than $8, and way more than $20, too… to repair the damage from a single rejection 

sometimes i don’t get a tip

*i can also just average it out - i’ve made $80 in tips to make 5 deliveries to this customer

"wondering legitimacy so i’ve been driving for grubhub for almost 7 months and never really had an issue recently. this restaurant had an attitude with me because i did not wait for the food when they wouldn’t even tell me how long the wait. time was the next time i went into the restaurant. they decided to get short and say i’m not giving you the order my friend then after he does that he refused. 

to give it to me so i called the customer letting them know so they can understand what the delay is, and i tried calling grubhub with no result. i don’t understand how these restaurants can do that to withholding the order from them. if they did not want me back at the establishment, they should’ve told grubhub not to send me here. they have that ability on their tablet or even on the computer logging into their merchant account. 

but to the point, i’m still on hold after the weekend so saturday was the original report got put on hold for false complaint that was not true saying i was harassing and refusing to leave the restaurant  it was a hot day that day so they weren’t giving me the order. i stood my own little corner. at least to be in the ac when doing the calls i had to do. all this is on body cam showing that i did nothing wrong. i do have a body cam that proves if there’s any false accusations that arise. 

i showed them the information and they gave me my account back in less than eight hours but the main problem they decided the next day to put my account on hold again and since then when they did it on sunday, putting it on hold again they claim have a photo well as written evidence against me as opposed to the first support, same date and all

but again clearly, my body cam footage shows that i’ve been professional trying to find out a solution to a problem and now i have no way to reach anybody and when i call on the phone, they say they don’t handle it and it’s a specialized team. anybody knows what i can do to get that pushed along to get my account back because clearly i have evidence i did nothing wrong on the date. mentioned",2024-08-21 13:08:22,0,2,Reddit,GrubHub

"does my driver get penalized if i report missing items? 

hey drivers! i've never had anything but excellent grubhub drivers—effecient, on time, friendly & follow instructions for delivery. i try to tip accordingly, minimum 
25%, or higher if it's weird hours, includes awkward drinks, soup, frozen items etc.

that said, recently i've received a series of deliveries that were missing items or included an item significantly wrong from what i ordered. 

all of my deliveries were ""safety sealed"" and would have been by no fault of the driver.

will i negatively impact the driver if i submit an order for partial refund for the incorrect/missing items? i hesitate to submit these requests in case they affect the driver, because i know it's not the driver's fault. they'd have no way of looking inside closed/sealed orders to check if an item is correct or missing. 

i don't like paying for items i didn't receive or didn't order, but even more, i hate the idea of the already-underpaid driver being penalized for something they can't control.

this is not the norm. 90% of the time my order is correct and gets here with zero issues—but the last three orders i placed at different restaurants were either missing an item completely or significantly different from the order i placed (e.g. ordered biscuits and gravy but received no gravy).

does my refund or partial refund affect the driver's pay/tip/rating?

"schedule commitment rating - how does it work...? i've been chatting with support about this to no avail.  i'm hoping one of you has better insights.

i'm a recently reactivated driver.  i managed to get a few blocks scheduled. (apparently its quite the feeding frenzy when they become available) 

one day before my first block, i thought i would accept orders only to find i was arbitrarily deactivated pending my 4th id verification.  

when my first scheduled block rolled around a day later, my identity verification was still pending, so i was still unable to accept orders.  to be clear, i was ready and able to drive, but the app wouldn't allow me to take orders.  i even tried going active just to see if i could and the app stopped me cold.

yesterday i was finally able to take orders and drove for a few hours through dinner service.  

this morning i checked my stats, and my schedule commitment rating is at 54%  i presume this is because i missed a scheduled block, because my id needed to be verified.  

now i have little to no access to scheduling, so how am i supposed to improve my commitment rating?

i'm trying to make a common sense appeal that the missed block should not have counted against my commitment because i had already been through identity verification 3 times prior and this was unnecessary.  it had been a few years since i drove for gh and i don't remember it being this complicated.",2024-08-18 14:55:31,2,6,Reddit,GrubHub

"to those who have lost their scheduling ability and want it  back  i have noticed there are lots of people in this sub who have lost their ability to schedule blocks and are desperate to get them back. that happened to me in february but i was able to get them back, but you need to do it a certain way. just responding to their emails doesn't work since they don't reply to emails going to that address. 

what you need to do is as follows. submit a request [here](https://driver-support.grubhub.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=360001426972).

select ""delivery partners request form"" then scroll down the page to select a topic and choose ""i have delivered a grubhub order"" then ""scheduling"" then ""i received an email with scheduling restricted in the subject line"". when they email you back with their automated bs then reply to that email and ask them to either explain what you did wrong or reactivate you. don't be jerky about it either, i assume that might help.

that's what got them back for me. i also  just helped someone on this sub that had been trying to get them back for a while that hadn't tried this method. once they did this they got them back within a day or two. for me it took about a week, but they messaged me the next day saying they were reviewing my account. let me know if anyone gets them back!",2024-08-16 13:16:47,7,8,Reddit,GrubHub

"question about refunds as a consumer delivery drivers of all kinds regularly screw up my delivery address.  i live on a busy street so i imagine they just go to the street behind my house because it's easier to park / their gps may even take them there.  but while my dwelling is attached to the building on that street, it is a completely different apartment on a different street with a different address and i don't have a key into their lobby.  my door has a completely different house number than the door(s) i've found my orders at.  my delivery instructions explicitly state 

> ""red door with number ""###"" on it - if the door does not have ""###"" then it is the not the correct address.""

however i'd wager that about 1 in 4 orders is delivered wrong.  i always get a refund when this happens regardless of whether or not i am ultimately able to find my food (which i often am, but definitely not always) - because i do not pay for grubhub+, delivery fees, and tip to have to walk around looking for the food i ordered.  i pay for those things to have the food delivered directly to the address on my order.  i don't want to screw over people so i'm wondering if i should just delete grubhub altogether.

i'm wondering though - how does this impact drivers?  grubhub pretty much always refunds me no matter what - do the drivers lose their tip or anything?  does the restaurant eat the cost?",2024-08-14 14:23:22,1,6,Reddit,GrubHub

accountability  i thought this group would be a place to get tips and hear funny stories. instead it’s a bunch of people crying. this is not supposed to be a full time job.no we don’t need guaranteed hourly wage or benefits. get a real job if you want that. no gh is not waking no and chose to pick on you.  im sorry if you quit your job ( most likely got fired) ti do this full time that’s a horrible choice. gh has been nothing but good to me and other drivers who don’t come on here to cry. i have grieves and family members who drive and they don’t complain like you guys do. i talk to other drivers while waiting they love the extra income. no i don’t work for gh no i’m not  trying to suck up to them they ca be around for 100 years or go away tomorrow i’ll be fine. the question you have to ask  yourself if they were 10 drivers like you in your area how would i go? here it would be awesome ,2024-08-11 15:26:01,0,21,Reddit,GrubHub
"the on time % i admit to only doing about six or seven grubhub orders each month now, but that on time percent is 100% rigged. there's no if and's or doubts about it.

you absolutely cant keep it at 100% if you live in a city where there's more than three people at a traffic light. if you live in the suburbs without a lot of traffic, maybe it's possible? 

nobody in houston has a 100% on time. i had like an 85% on time and accepted an order the other day. i was already at this restaurant. i'm not talking about driving past it or being on the other side of the parking lot, i was  literally standing directly inside the fucking restaurant. i was picking up an uber order. 

i had this food in under 30 seconds. i dropped this off 1.5 miles away and my completion percentage immediately went down .

i think what they're doing is keeping the clock running on another driver that dropped it.. maybe another just dropped it within 5 minutes of me picking it up but the clock was still running? 

whatever is going on, you absolutely cannot maintain a 100% on time. they're hooking you up if you do have 100%.

"how to get notification of delivery when i order from grub hub i turn off contactless delivery and put in the delivery instructions for the driver to knock on the door and that my doorbell is broken. my hope is that at the very least, i will be alerted to the food being dropped off at my house if not having it actually handed to me.

however, i would say, in the last 6 times i've ordered 4 or 5 times the food has been left on the doorstep and the driver has just left resulting in the food sitting anywhere from 15 min to an hour and me getting cold food. yes, i am partially to blame as i should be more vigilant, but sometimes i get wrapped up in doing something and lose track of time.

is it asking too much to have the driver knock on my front door, give me a phone call, or simply send me a text notifying me the food has arrived? as a former food delivery driver myself, i always tip north of 20%, but now i'm rethinking it to not tipping or setting up a cash tip to require interaction for the driver to receive their tip. curious as to what grub hub drivers thoughts are. and yes, i've sent complaints to grub hub but i'm not sure they address customer issues and hold their drivers accountable.",2024-08-06 12:08:17,1,18,Reddit,GrubHub

by the time i drove to pick up the order and had to wait...they sent two more orders because i did not accept the first because my block was ending  literally three minutes later. 

why tf. are yall sending orders that require an additional 40 minutes to deliver when my block is ending three minutes later. 

that is 9 dollars a f in hour... basically.

"ok, apparently my last post was extremely controversial, so i’m making this to clear things up because i can’t edit my post. i’ll start by reiterating what happened yesterday, with as much detail as possible.

i ordered food from grubhub. i’m the customer, not the driver. i got a couple meals for myself and my mom, and paid a 20% tip on top of the total (which already “includes the tip”, but grubhub pays their drivers shit so i feel like that doesn’t count). i do this routinely with uber eats as well, which is what i normally order food on. this restaurant only had a grubhub page.  
  
i live in an apartment complex. what makes it annoying to find my exact apartment are the very small signs, but it’s not bad to drive on and i always leave the same detailed instructions in multiple languages. it’s basically a big loop with a couple cul de sacs. this complex is situated on a hill, and it has two entrances. my driver was coming up the hill, and i live closer to the first entrance, so my instructions (minus all the language that says where i live) basically said “go in the first entrance, keep driving down the road, and make the first left. also, don’t go to the senior center, the gps sometimes takes drivers there by accident. please call if you get lost.” (this has happened multiple times, no idea why, so weird). anyways, that was all the driver needed to do. these instructions were also in spanish, arabic, and traditional chinese.  
  
so i’m watching the driver come up the hill and i see him turn into the entrance. as i’m preparing to go outside, i get “your order has been delivered!” with this picture attached (you may need to tap on the photo): https://www.reddit.com/r/grubhubdrivers/s/2u2y4t4u3g  
  
and then he left. that image you’re seeing, with my food on the ground, is right next to the entrance. he did not call me. he did not text me. no attempt to communicate with me. this is all that happened. he spent 10 seconds on the premises, dropped my food on the ground, and then left. grubhub gave me a $20 credit for my trouble, so i imagine something happened to the driver.  
  
i thought it was so ridiculous and insane that it would make a good reddit post. because like… come on. what the fuck? who does this? but i got comment after comment saying “you didn’t tip”, “you need to leave better instructions”, and some comments thinking i was the driver..? some comments asking about a gate code or something? i don’t fucking know. so i’m writing this in the hopes that this is coherent enough to understand. i hope it suffices. it wouldn’t let me edit my last post, so figured this would be a better solution.  
  
in short… don’t do this. just don’t.",2024-07-30 04:32:51,28,109,Reddit,GrubHub

i tell him the address and how the diner said to leave it at the front lobby.  

he is then like “no you can’t leave that here!  what if someone steals it?!”

i chatted with support and they called and confirmed that the order was already picked up. 

here is the issue i have besides the flat pay of a $1 for a cancelled order. 

i was doing a mission where 6 deliveries between 11am and 1:59pm would get a $24 bonus.

like i said this could all just be coincidental but gh used to pull me about 50-75 weekly and since i've started using a dedicated phone i've easily doubled that amount. last week i pulled in $271 which is an anomaly for my market. so maybe i'm crazy....maybe i'm onto something?????",2024-07-26 11:37:31,4,21,Reddit,GrubHub

"canceled orders  so apparently grubhub has decided that orders getting canceled by the customer after pick up is complete is no longer paid in full.  despite receiving an email a few weeks ago that sounded like a positive change, something about ""you will now be paid a percentage of the order based on how much of it was complete"" sounds good. oh but no.  instead you just get $1 regardless.


this happened after waiting for an order at kfc $10 for 3 miles. , it was already an hour old when i accepted it and then i continued to wait 30 more minutes for the order.  i finally get the order and start driving, it is only like a few minutes to get to the drop off btw, and they canceled it almost immediately after i selected ""leaving"".  which i don't blame them it had been 1.5 hours at that point.

originally thought this would be a win for me until i saw was only paid $1.  called support and they basically told me to bend over and take the new policy in the ass like a good robot.


thought ""at least i got some free food"", but the food wasn't even what the customer ordered which sounded much better then what i got.  the chicken is all stuck together with the skin falling off all soggy and gross.  pathetic.  can't believe this kfc is still in business.  i so wish i could stop any of their orders from being sent to me at all.

"grubhub vs uber delivery i've now taken exactly two offers from grubhub, so take this with a grain of salt...

navigations sucks.   can't mark as delivered because navigation is flat out wrong.   (google maps since they don't seem inclined to have their own)   finally over-rode after pacing up and down the stairs three times worried about the apartment street address...

uber at least leads me to the correct unit, without having to run google maps (which apparently sucks in apartments)

i knocked on the poor girl's door requesting contactless delivery, and watched her hold the plastic bag while it filled up at the bottom with sauce.

(500+ uber deliveries and 100% satisfaction, i'd give myself two thumbs down so far for my two grubhub deliveries.)

i knew i'd have to wait but 35 minutes is ridiculous. both customers were thankfully very understanding. i was hoping at least one of them would tip me extra, especially the second one since i kept her mcflurries cold. but they didn't. $15 for 50 minutes isn't terrible at least, so there's that.

"person who works at jail stole food, should i call the jail? i dropped the food off at 1128pm and the diner reported the food as not received by 1145pm.  this was in a secured facility and the only way in was by the intercom.  it was the 4th avenue jail in phoenix arizona which is a large building with many doors.  

prior to dropping off the order i felt the diner was shady because it was the jail building but with no directions. 

so, i messaged the diner asking which door do i deliver the food to?  she said the north west door, and how it was at the corner of this street and the other.  

i texted her every single thing i was doing because ppl with bad directions for huge buildings need to know, “hey, i’m coming with your food” ya know?  like i’m communicating with you so you get your order.  

i arrive at the door, and i press the intercom button and tell them i’m here to drop off this food order for this (female name), and the person who buzzed me in was a female.  

again, this is a jail.  the female buzzes me in and it’s a room that only has an elevator and a dark hallway leading to god knows where.  i felt uncomfortable so i left the food in that foyer room.  it def looked like an area i shouldn’t have been in because it was an employee entrance with an elevator that had a key fob next to it.  so i left the food in that room.  i mean why not? it is the jail.  this person knows which door and i’m assuming it was her that buzzed me in.  i’m texting her and i get no response.  

i dropped the food off and just left.  and then 15 mins later it’s cancelled.  i ask her why? and she said “i never got the food and i didn’t cancel it grubhub did”.

i called grubhub and asked if i was still going to get paid, and they told me yes.  grubhub then told me it wasn’t them that cancelled this order it was the diner who cancelled the order through the app.  

now, i’m like…. this lady, had i not been paid she wouldn’t been messing with my money, but in actuality i’m assuming she stole the food!  

like how are you going to steal food when you work at the city jail in downtown phoenix?  

should i call her work tomorrow and report this?  i have the time i dropped the order off and the time it was marked cancelled.  idk, apart of me wants to call but then another part of me is trying to do the right thing and let the jail know they have someone sus up in there.

the other day, i was doing this while picking up an order, and i saw a guy taking a picture of my license plate, and someone else told me that it's now potentially a $280 ticket. apparently the meter people are cracking down now. i got a $10 ticket 2 weeks ago because my meter ran a few minutes over (came out to the people writing the ticket). they've decided to be ruthless.

btw there is no reason for gh to rush drivers like a first responder going to a fire as unlike fires that had broke out restaurants cannot complete the meal any faster nor can they even get the meal on the fire quicker just because i rushed nor to the door. 

it doesn’t really matter whether i was already in the direction to the pickup before it paged me or finished up what i am doing errands for 4 more minutes ie bathroom my drop off time is exactly the same the food would be out at the same time obviously and the food would arrive to customer the same. so the algorithm should really chill. ironically i noticed their auto reassign idea since ab5 which came same time as covid would’t crack down on multi apping or resulting delays to customers at all the way they set it up. 

also i got a low order attendance violation, not lateness once despite the customer and gh being noticed of restaurant delays. also estimated drop off time is unbeatable nor realistic no matter how fast or smooth the delivery. the while thing is just ridiculous.",2024-07-15 12:14:06,2,19,Reddit,GrubHub

"their system sucks when restaurants say that the order will take 45 mins to cook, and they say that back to gh- gh does nothing with that and sends the driver in a minute to sit there. we can unassign but get hit on acceptance rate. here’s the deal, if it’s been over a half hour that’s gh issue not ours. least they can do is not hit the ar.  we also don’t get paid anything. then, i finally had to just say screw it. i called cs and railed on them and said if u can’t do anything to help drivers with this then least you can do is write a freaking tech ticket so they fix this dang issue. or pay people a fee. no one should have to wait an hour for an order and i’m sorry but right now i can’t get up a level if i keep dealing with these and ar keeps going down. i’m so mad. i’ve even written product people at gh they don’t care.

"interesting order last night i took an order last night- $10 for about 3.5 miles.  burger, fries, and soda.

i make the delivery (it's a warehouse lobby), snap the picture, complete, and start leaving.  i get a text and then a phone call from the customer that that's not where he's staying.  he's at a hotel, one of those well-known chain hotels.  and there is one not far from the restaurant that he ordered from.  normally, i would leave it as is, i did my job.  but he said that the hotel reception gave him the wrong address, so i figured i'd do him a solid and go back and grab the food (i was near the exit gate, so a hundred feet, no biggie) and deliver to his hotel.  i was going back to that area anyway, to try to get more orders as that's a good area with lots of restaurants, so i figured what the hell.

as i start driving back with the food, i get a text with the address of the hotel.  hmmm  i don't recognize the city. 🤣🤣🤣  i put it into googlemaps, it's over 100 miles away.

yea, i'd say that he had the wrong address alright.  i called to tell him that unfortunately, he won't be getting his burger.  thanks for the tip.",2024-07-12 12:03:51,8,7,Reddit,GrubHub

guess what when i use my instant cash card and paid $0.50 it said that the payment was pending. so that means i get no money until tomorrow and i'm wondering if this is just a clue by for that the app is gone bankrupt.

i think it may be bankruptcy because they can't be so stupid that they don't recognize that while people are on the road they need to cash out for various expenses gas oil food drinks etc. this is not something that a lot of people do with a paycheck week to week. so honestly i think this is done.

"how to steal from gh without penalty  i’m tired of dealing with this company and all their issues. not letting us cash out, taking money out of earnings and not telling us why, horrible driver care service that doesn’t respond or resolve issues. this company is failing and is on the verge of collapse and soon it will be bought out by someone else or hopefully it just shuts down once and for all. so to help expedite that process i will be teaching you all how to steal food from grubhub without any penalty and while still getting paid for it. 

step 1.) accept and pick up order as normal 

step 2.) drive towards customers house, get only close enough that your able to mark “arrive.” normally that is when you’re about .2 miles away from the customers house. 

step 3.) mark arrived and then drive down the road to a random house, take a picture of that house (make sure not to include house number in this photo) then submit it and complete the order as complete. at this point now you’ll be paid in full for the delivery and you have the food 

step 4.) if the customer contacts you at all asking where their food is or telling you it was the wrong house, ignore them and block the number. 

step 5.) if grubhub calls you on behalf of the customer, ignore them. if you want to answer you can and just say you delivered the order to the house the gps sent you and it matched the address but you don’t have to answer them. 

step 6.) at this point the customer will most likely have the order canceled, they will get refunded for the order and you will keep the entire pay for the order and keep all the food. congrats! 

this works 100% of the time and you get no violation on your account and there is zero accountability or safeguards from grubhub to prevent us drivers from taking advantage of this system, so enjoy it! you could actually make money for getting free food, how awesome is that! hopefully if enough of us start doing this grubhub will be forced to shut down from losing so much money. grubhub likes to take advantage of drivers, many customers do as well, but why let them? i think it’s time we start taking advantage of them. enjoy!

"just got my first violation after 6000 deliveries i got an email saying “a significant number of your orders were canceled between jun 28, 2024 - jul 5, 2024…. this is your 1st violation. as a reminder, if you have 3 current violations, your account will be blocked.”

so i went on the app to see what orders have been cancelled. were customers stealing orders? was i delivering to the wrong addresses? was i mixing up orders? nope. two orders were canceled by the customer because he thought it was expensive. he ordered twice from the same restaurant and couldn’t figure out how to cancel it until i reached him (different story, he came out to grab it and i said no you cancelled it. he said okay turned around and walked inside). the other 2 orders that were “cancelled” were because of restaurant closure. 

i called support and said how are any of these my fault? why am i penalized for it? they said it’s automatically generated by the system. i asked if anyone checks it before it goes out, they said no. then she proceeded to say it’s only for 3 months. i said that’s not the point, the point is i’m being accused of something that is not my fault at all. they then said there’s nothing to do now, you cannot appeal it even until i get 2 more violations and my account blocked.

"a frustrating experience. so i reactivated my account, just for the extra income for the summer.  appeal was accepted mid-may. and had to order a new driver card through driver care as for some reason it wouldn't let me through the app. card arrived in time for a schedule at the end of may. monday, no issues whatsoever and being that i live in a region with hourly play a slow day isn't all that upsetting. wednesday however.... this is where the frustration of gh begins. 

  
i get an order 1 1/2 hours into my first block, nearing completion, i noticed that my app had marked me unavailable and that i needed to update my app in order to mark myself available, complete the delivery, complete the process so gh doesn't think i'm awol and i still can't mark myself available... i call driver care to see what's up and get told to uninstall and reinstall to see if that fixes it.. it didn't. i get hit with the screen of  needing to reactivate my account etc.. the driver care specialist... realizes that my account was apparently and mistakenly flagged as inactive mid shift.... so i get marked as absent for 3 of my 5 blocks scheduled. my account finally gets activated and despite gh knowingly aware that the fault was on their own side.. i wasn't given any reimbursement for lost pay and would not receive any.. so accountability is clearly out of the question as usual.

  
the kicker - my new driver card won't be reactivated via the app as it continuously gives me errors.. i notify gh of this and they ask for me to send a photo of my card to activate it, they state it's activated though the app doesn't reflect that. i reiterate this to them and they \\of course ignored it. few weeks later i get an order that requires me to use my card and low and behold it doesn't work.. which kills my entire schedule and availability... contact care once again and it turns out that when they activated my card, they activated a completely different card that wasn't even in my possession.. alongside my card.... once again no accountability taken.. no reimbursement.. but hey my card is once again active again ""could be a lie though""

  
now onto a rather recent matter.. while waiting for order #9 as weekend shifts are often busier than weekday.. i get a notification that i missed 2 orders and would be flagged if i miss 3rd.. upon checking my app. no orders were missed and this oddly comes after an order was cancelled 2 hours after it was delivered. the customer tried to say it was never delivered despite gh showing them the picture of where the food was delivered which had their house number in direct view. (gotta love people trying to get free meals.) seeing as i never missed an order, i close out the app and open again and it oddly now shows that i missed an order 5 minutes ago despite it never reaching my app or notification.. i call driver care to see just what that was about... and they give me the run around saying i must have been in bad service.. i was right next to the restaurant that was intended for that order with full 5g... needless to say it just seemed like another common hiccup with the app, and of course my profile reflects on 2 missed orders instead of 1 or what should have been 0.

it wasn't that bad, the miles were usually more than shown in the offer by one to three miles. pissed me off but i could deal with it. 

today was the fucking final straw. they offered me an applebee's order at 2.2 miles for $12. great! i went to pick the order up. when i picked it up, the map showed it was 15 fucking miles! that's way below $1 a mile. 

i called support, told them to cancel the order because i refuse to be cheated like this. they warned me that i'll be penalized for it, i told them to go fuck themselves because at that point, i'm never delivering for gh again. and told them to tell their boss to stuff it up their ass, and the customer can starve because they didn't tip close to enough to compensate for the distance. 

i didn't even bother returning the food to applebee's. my wife is enjoying the food as of now, grubhub can get fucked! and fuck the entitled customer, too.

"where does the food go? so i order through grubhub fairly often. about 25% of the time i get notified that my order has been delivered but it hasn’t. the photos are completely dark or photos of a random wall, things like that.

so i’m dying of curiosity. where does the food go? is grubhub making the whole thing up and creating fake drivers? or is someone desperate and eating the meals themselves?

also, any suggestions for avoiding this issue? i feel like i tip pretty well, about $5 regardless of the total even if it’s a large percentage of a small order. i’m diabetic and it’s getting dangerous because i try to time my insulin to take it when my food is on the way. when the food doesn’t appear i’m in big trouble. on the other hand, if i wait for the food to arrive then i have to wait for the insulin to kick in and then my food becomes extra cold and unpleasant.

since then, the suggested tips have gone from 12%/15%/20% to 5%/7%/10%!!! they've also added a new ""other fee,"" which is usually $1 or $2. so now we have delivery fee, service fee, and other fee. can anyone with nyc gh driving experience share how much exactly goes to drivers out of these fees? i want to make sure i'm tipping appropriately. also, do you expect the tip to be a percentage of the total food + tax, or the entire total after all fees? or is it more about distance/effort, since most nyc gh drivers use bikes & mopeds? and how much is ebt in nyc these days (or is that just a doordash thing?)? finally, for folks like me who don't pay any delivery fee and a reduced service fee because of amazon prime, do drivers get a reduced amount from all prime members, or do you still get the same amount and someone else 'swallows' that discount?

grubhub should direct the customers to the nearest restaurant location. the grubhub app should automatically direct customers to the nearest restaurant location for that restaurant and even suggest something similar that is closer if there is not one nearby. they need to think about our mileage and also the environment for that matter. plus it would free up more drivers since they are not occupied with long distance orders.,2024-06-20 12:36:42,14,17,Reddit,GrubHub

"gh using gps of former address has anyone heard of gh sending a driver to a customer’s former address via gps, even though that address is no longer in the account, and the correct current address is printed on the receipt? 

so, i order tonight, the system tells me the order has been delivered, but when i go to find it at the front desk of my apartment building, nothing is there (there are detailed instructions about the name of my building and how to drop off in my account). i check the photo the driver took and it is definitely not my address. moments later i get a text from the resident of the address it was delivered to (having found my phone number on the receipt), and it turns out to be the house next to where i lived almost 10 years ago. the two addresses are across town from one another.

gh had the order redelivered, and when the second order was delivered the new driver called and asked if the address on the receipt was right (it was) because “the gps is really messed up.” this driver clearly paid attention to the address on the order but was confused about why the gps was trying to send him to another part of town. 

when i look at both past orders in the app, they show a drop off location pin of my old address, but the order clearly has my current and current address on it. my account also clearly has my current address in it and no other, though it surely once had my old address in it. 

besides being in different parts of town, the two street names are nothing alike. i think the part of it being next door to my old address is that my current and correct address begins 231 [current street name] and it was left at 331 [old street name] and it was trying to take the driver to my old address at 333 [old street name]. first driver didn’t read clearly on several accounts, but he was also led astray by the gps.

"driver care chick rocks! wait, never mind 😞 i’m on a delivery, decent money… if it weren’t for the detour (5 miles), and the bad pin 😅 

then i get a nice next pickup for the queue 😉

i have bars, but shit for data, so that’s not helping…

driver care answers just as i pull in to make the first stop, she stays on the line while i make the hand off - she can her me on my phone but she’s still on the audio in the car…

i get back in, explain a couple times, that i couldn’t mark the delivery arrived and that i can’t make the next pickup on time because of the bad pin and the detour… she pretty much gets it, first time 🙂

she asks me if i’m willing to proceed with/to the next pickup… i tell her i’m already on the way!

but! that i’m gonna need her to fix the arrival time… gps says i’m gonna be two minutes late 🫤

okay she says, can you make 4:56? *it’s a 4 minute buffer 

i’m like hell yeah!

i thank her, tell her she’s awesome, and hang up 

i pull up to the pickup at exactly 4:54, two minutes after the original arrival time - thank her again for the 4:56 arrival time and finish the delivery 

just to make sure, after i check the pay, i check my stats 

i was marked late 😟

        the other day i had a weird thing happen when an order appeared and i accepted it right away. it was definitely a nice priced order with low mileage. when i got to the restaurant i went to click the arrived toggle and realized the order was gone with no notice of cancellation. that pissed me off so i called driver care which is a lost cause in itself an got the usual garbage they spew about how they're sorry for the inconvenience blah blah blah. i got mad and told the person on the other end that this conversation was going nowhere and hung up on them. since then scheduling has become a joke. do you think it's a coincidence or am i being punished?",2024-06-15 12:59:45,7,11,Reddit,GrubHub

another issue i run into is when i do see the order on screen and hit accept, it'll refresh and mark it as missed anyways. i don't care about my acceptance rate all that much, but it's frustrating because this always happens with high paying orders. i wanted to know if this was commonly an android thing or its the fault of the app overall. i was thinking of buying a small used iphone just for delivery gigs to help as i've heard this issue isn't nearly as prominent on ios. i wanted to hear some insight from others before doing anything.

"has anyone actually gotten grubhub to pay out on a mistakenly cancelled order? or, for that matter, even gotten a call back from anyone when you elevate a concern?

i had a pickup at a wetzel's pretzels inside a walmart that wasn't plotting correctly, so it wouldn't let me arrive myself at the location. so i called in to have driver care arrive me as i was walking in. while i was waiting for a live human being to answer, i asked for the order, and they told me it had been picked up by another driver. it was a $15 order with about 6 miles to the store from the notification. i told the rep that eventually answered what happened....misplaced location, couldn't arrive, already picked up. i did that from the parking lot. for 5 minutes this guy stumbled around trying to find my account, trying to find the active job, and i'm getting the automated notifications that i accepted an offer but hadn't picked up yet the whole time. he finally tells me he's having computer problems and that i should call back. at the same time, i get notification that i've been removed from the delivery. i ask him if he did that and he said yes, and that i should call back about the cancelation pay. 

so i immediately call back, and for 7 more minutes i try to explain the situation to a different rep. she tries to tell me that i got dropped from the order because i never marked myself as arrived, so i wasn't eligible for cancelation pay. we went round and round and i explained the facts 3 or 4 more times until i asked to speak with a manager.

manager comes on, listens to the whole story again, and eventually says someone else from driver care will contact me, and there's nothing else she can do. 

i called back a 3rd time a couple of hours later to ask when i should expect the call from driver care. i was told i would get an email in a couple of days. that was on a wednesday. 

the next monday, i call again, since i haven't gotten an email. this rep drags things out for 5 or 6 minutes and finally tells me that the decision was made not to pay cancelation pay since i never arrived myself. i immediately asked for a manager again, and the rep says i will get a call back from a manager. that was 2 days ago...no callback. 

i'm not going to starve if i don't get paid for this, but at this point it's the principle of the whole thing. i want to know what i should have done differently to get cancelation pay in this case, and i'm willing to waste some time on hold (while doing other things) until someone in driver care actually answers my questions. 

anyone had any luck getting through the gatekeeper frontline reps to actually talk with someone who can actually answer questions without a script and has the authority to make a decision? i know uber eats managers can do so, and are normally pretty good to work with, but so far i'm getting stonewalling by grubhub, and it's pissing me off.

i just don't know how much longer this company is gonna last, the stock is almost all but destroyed, the only reason it's normalized is because the company bought their shares back during the decline. yes they used what little profits they had to buy their shares back to save the company.

taken from a recent (april 2024) [reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/just-eat-takeaway-posts-q1-gross-transaction-value-above-expectations-2024-04-17/) report:

>its gtv grew by 11% in key uk and ireland markets and by 5% in northern europe, another major one for the company, offsetting an **11% drop in north america** and a 15% decrease in southern europe and australia, the company said.

>""half of the group's business remains down in the double digits and affects the group's growth/cash generation profile,"" genelot added.

>just eat said its constant currency gtv growth excluding north america of 3% in the quarter was within the 2024 guidance range of 2% to 6% increase.

>**the group said it was still exploring a partial or full sale of its struggling u.s. unit grubhub.**

>on monday, it announced its exit from new zealand.

i don't have a lot of hope looking at the future for us gh drivers. the company seems to be spending a lot of money on marketing though and expanding into different kinds of deliveries like groceries. i'm sure it won't be long before gh will either be dissolved, bought at a bargain (although why would anyone buy a company that is losing money), or maybe merged with dd or ue.

"can i become a driver for just a few weeks? unemployed and house hunting gave me an idea. i've moved to the triangle area in nc, and i'm shopping for a house with my partner. i quit my job and am on sabbatical while we decide where we want to end up settling here. my job is to scope potential neighborhoods.

i used to deliver food (pre-app era) back in college, and it was such an efficient way to get familiar with all the streets/neighborhoods in a town. 

instead of aimlessly driving around neighborhoods wasting gas, i thought why not do some food delivery work for a few weeks and make a few bucks while i'm at it? just a couple of questions:



* is there any reason i can't sign up and just drive for a few weeks? 3-6 weeks likely.
* is it pointless if i'm only working during lunchtime? i'm not really doing it for the income, but is that generally a busy time?
* is it true that new drivers have a ""honeymoon"" period where they get the best orders? i've heard this theory about doordash. new drivers get preferential treatment for a few weeks in order to ""hook"" them before things level off. if true, great! i'll take advantage. but is that just a conspiracy theory?

again, i'm not expecting to earn significant income driving just 4-5 hours a day. i'd just like to do slightly better than breaking even, i guess.

driver gives me the bag but there’s no blizzard. i can see her passenger is eating it with the long red spoon. she says she never received it.

edit:  tl;dr comment summary:

- some drivers do steal and admit it here
- some drivers suspect other drivers steal 
- most drivers seem to be honest
- it’s possible my driver purchased their own  blizzard and honestly didn’t receive mine

so, i live in a condo complex, with many buildings. when you enter (one entrance) the gps always directs people to turn right where buildings 1-5 are. i live in building 6 and is not visible from that area. i put in the delivery directions that it is the second building on the left when you come thru the entrance. 

still, almost every time i order food, the driver calls me saying they’re in front of building 5 and they’re confused. 

i just updated my address to this (fake numbers)
333 100th st, bldg 6, unit #

and updated the delivery details to say it’s the second building on the left, and if you’re in front of buildings 1-5 how to find building 6 from there.

"no more warnings? they should just give up and shut this service down. i've been doing grubhub delivery for 5 years. they used to give you 3 warning messages if you were running late. traffic was insane today in ny with the bad weather and overpopulation. zero accommodations from gh for the traffic.  i stopped to go to the bathroom today and apparently this was too much so gh took the order away while i was across the street. they have made the check-in radius so small that you basically have to be inside the restaurant to mark arrived now. you used to be able to mark arrived from a half mile away. so i just picked up an order for uber eats at the same restaurant and watched the gh order sit on the shelf. 

i go to pick up a gh order from an expensive restaurant and they didn't even check the tablet so never started making the meal. typical because they get tons of dd and ue orders, but forget to check gh tablet. i cancel because i don't want to wait 40 minutes (penalty against me).

later i picked up an open block on gh, but wasn't getting any orders (as is usual for gh) so i stopped home to take a break and grab a snack. i turned off gh because i forgot i had scheduled. they used to send me messages to turn the app back on (helpful since i have very severe adhd memory issues). they no longer send warning messages as i said before and they just cancelled my scheduled block without warning. this company is an incompetent last place (not even runner up). gh would do the whole industry a favor by going under. i look forward to seeing the headline of the demise of this evil incompetent delivery service. literally every restaurant i work with hates gh and makes fun of how they never see any orders from it.",2024-06-06 19:57:25,10,46,Reddit,GrubHub

"gh ratings metric scenario & business for drivers... restaurant arrival time - if the drivers don't press arrived button on time then the drivers are marked as late even though they might have arrived on time...

does it mean gh's location service doesn't work???

many gig companies nowadays use drop-off time for ratings purposes which should make a common sense.

gh app is perhaps less driver friendly... if you are doing a dbl the customers don't  know about it & they try to trash the you on call/ text  - and gh is silent...

acceptance rate should not play any role in deciding whether drivers should get more business or big orders etc. 

it's a contract & drivers should be free to accept / reject orders at will... however gh loves to embarrass drivers by showing 3 boxes etc ...

i do shipt as well, which is owned by target - they got rid of accetance rate way long ago because they realized that it's an insult to independent contractors to force into something they are not comfortable with especially business wise.

if the restaurant is closed upon arrival ( especially on public holidays ) gh doesn't pay anything to drivers for making an attempt to drive to the restaurant, time & gas. ubereats pays $3 - $4 out of respect.

it should all boil down to how many deliveries a driver successfully completed ( completion rate ) with good customer ratings. it should not be based on how many a driver missed.

on blocks front - there is no penalty to quit blocks anytime on doordash or shipt. giving more business to drivers on a block is debatable. all do that and i like that but if you trash driver ratings due to ridiculous accepance or restaurant arrival time etc then how on earth good drivers are supposed to blocks &  get more business?

i propose only 2 - completion % ( after accepting ) &  dropoff time.

at the end of the day gh or any other gig companies will do what they feel right for their business... there are no 2s about it... but can't they strike a good balance & avoid throwing insults thru app? 

the current gh ratings metric doesn't make sense. this is on top of very less money offered by gh for very long distances. many blame newbies but i blame the high inflation & economy which is forcing drivers to accept nonsensical orders.

i understand it is tl but there are many more points which i perhaps didn't mention here... like food not received etc.

gh gave me solid money in the past so no qualms, sitting near 4000 deliveries but don't feel like doing as my main one anymore. still respect & love gh and always hoping for positive changes.

what do you guys think? - do you have any other points to contribute?

"customer lied about incomplete delivery - will i be okay? about an hour ago i had a delivery drop-off to a gated apartment building. there was an apt # but no instructions on how to get in the gate. i called the customer twice and both times it went to a man's voicemail (customer had a female name). i took the in-app photo of the food next to gate with the building number and began to leave. as i was driving away i saw a woman hurriedly going toward the gate , and i presumed it was the customer getting the food and drove away.

later i noticed that even though i was paid, the earnings page said the order was canceled. i called support because i figured something sus was going on, and sure enough the agent told me the customer said it was not delivered. i explained the situation, and the agent said she saw my photo of the drop off and said she screenshotted everything and included my statement about what happened. she assured me i would be fine.

let me preface by saying i'm running on android & have uninstalled & reinstalled the app several times to no avail. 
the glitch is: the app plays the cowbell noise to notify of an offer, but won't show me an offer; when i then swipe the app off my screen & press the icon to bring it back up, it shows i've missed 1 offer, do this a 2nd time, it shows i've missed 2 offers, do it a 3rd time & it shows i've missed 3 offers & signs me out. do it a 4th time & it finally shows the gold offer banner across the top of the screen & allows me to tap it to view the offer.
i can then accept or reject it, and need to sign back in to receive further offers. 
when i check my earnings list to see all offers, none have been listed as missed, because i've missed none.
i also concurrently run ubereats & spark, with no issues from those.
i'm guessing maybe spark is causing the issue with grubhub, but not sure.

"3 proven ways to profit more # dear drivers

it's getting harder to earn a decent income with gig delivery apps. inflation drives up costs for fuel, insurance, and car repairs, cutting into profits. it also reduces consumer demand when prices rise - no one is going to pay $50 for a happy meal!

on top of that, the companies behind **these apps are extremely greedy**. they flood the market with drivers, pay them less than they should, and use algorithms to pressure them into accepting bad offers.

**so what power do we have?**

# the power to say no, slow, or go go go

**option 1: say no to all bad offers**

very simply say no to bad offers. do not let the manipulation of app metrics like acceptance rates affect you. if everyone lived by this rule, the algorithm will start to shift and raise the offer. and there is a lot of room for them to increase. but it wont happen until it starts to happen collectively! say no to trash!

**option 2: go slow on all bad offers**

this only applies to states that have 'earn by time'. if you receive a $5 offer (bad offer!) , the only way you can profit is by delivering slowly. this way your active time pay goes up. so instead of doing that in 10 minutes, push it to 20.

this of course means you are tied up for 10 minutes more and wont get new offers then. most likely though, because of over saturation, you wont be getting an offer.

so it may make sense to take subpar offers and deliver them much slower than usual.

**option 3: go fast only on good offers**

this applies if you get a decent order. it wouldnt make sense to try to increase. your 'earn by time' because if you finish the order quickly you have more time left in that hour to receive another offer. this will increase your hourly rate.

**so its up to you and us, we can say no, slow, or go go.**  
**you control when the wheels move.**

"a discussion on proposition 22 (california) and why you should be premiere and do every order. well i live in california and with proposition 22 we are garuenteed 120% of the local minimum wage in the city we pick up in plus .34¢ per mile. 

in los angeles, grubhub uses ≈ $16.156 as its hourly rate. now multiply 1.2 to $16.156 you get $19.38. 

for every active hour you work you'll earn $19.38. 

so 40 hours of active time equals a guarentee of $775.48. you cannot make less than that because it's law. it's guarenteed. 

now that we have our earnings for active time lets include the miles.

let's say that week you drove 400 miles. you went up and down your entire delivery region. 

note: these are the miles you add up based on what grubhub says you drove not the miles you think you drove.

so 400 x .34¢ = $136. take those $136 and add it to your $775.48 and you get a total of

$911.48 in proposition 22 earnings.

now let's add the tips.

let's say customer tips added to $100. 

$100(tips) + $775.48(active time) + $136 (400 miles) = $1,011.48 (total earnings)

if at the end of the week grubhub only paid you $910.48(active time + miles), 

no big deal thats where the $1 adjustment will be added on monday morning. 

if grubhub paid you $912.48(active time + miles) well congrats you earned more than the guarentee.

grubhub doesn't have an endless supply of money to hand out so not everyone is going to receive 40 hours of active time. who do you think is more likely to receive it? a premiere driver who does the work or a cherry picking partner account? you're not outsmarting the system, they will stop sending you offers, plain and simple, if you're off block they have no obligation to send you anything.


and this isn't exclusive to grubhub, this applies to doordash and uber eats as well. although i don't know what those apps use at their hourly base but it shouldn't be too far  off.

"the dark side of delivery apps: how algorithms exploit workers and perpetuate inequality 
introduction:
in an era dominated by convenience and instant gratification, delivery apps like grubhub, uber eats, and doordash have revolutionized the way we order food. however, behind the sleek interfaces and promises of easy income lies a darker truth: the exploitation of delivery drivers through algorithmic manipulation.

the algorithm: always watching, always knowing
delivery apps utilize sophisticated algorithms to manage their fleets of drivers and optimize their operations. these algorithms track an extensive array of data points, including driver location, activity patterns, and even personal habits. from where you live to the speed at which you drive, these algorithms leave no stone unturned in their quest to predict and control driver behavior.

the impact on drivers:
for drivers, this constant surveillance has profound implications. drivers find themselves at the mercy of algorithms that prioritize profit over fair treatment. the algorithmic system is designed to ""starve the poor,"" favoring drivers in wealthier areas or those who can afford to work full-time. drivers living in low-income neighborhoods or relying on delivery gigs as a primary source of income are systematically disadvantaged.

the illusion of progress:
moreover, the algorithmic structure perpetuates a facade of progress while trapping drivers in a cycle of exploitation. despite promises of flexibility and upward mobility, drivers find themselves trapped in a system that offers little room for advancement. income levels are predetermined by algorithms that prioritize profitability for the company rather than the well-being of its workers.

the danger of algorithms:
the implications of these algorithms extend beyond the realm of delivery apps. they represent a broader trend in which technology is wielded as a tool of oppression, reinforcing existing inequalities and exacerbating socio-economic disparities. by relegating drivers to mere pawns in a profit-driven game, these algorithms pose a threat to the dignity and livelihoods of millions.

conclusion:
as consumers, we must confront the uncomfortable truth behind the convenience of delivery apps. we must demand transparency and accountability from companies that profit off the labor of others. it's time to recognize the human cost behind the algorithmic curtain and advocate for fair treatment and dignity for all workers, regardless of their socio-economic status. only then can we truly dismantle the systems of oppression perpetuated by technology and pave the way for a more just and equitable society.",2024-05-05 20:48:25,8,16,Reddit,GrubHub

enough is enough! we're tired of being at the mercy of corporate giants like grubhub, doordash, and uber eats. it's time to reclaim control over our food delivery experience and support local businesses.

these companies are devouring our wallets with hefty fees, leaving restaurants struggling to survive and customers paying inflated prices. they dictate terms, exploit workers, and monopolize the market, all while lining their pockets with our hard-earned money.

but guess what? we have the power to change this narrative! it's time to unite and take a stand against these behemoths. here's how you can get involved:

1. **spread the word:** share this post far and wide. let your friends, family, and fellow redditors know about the injustices perpetuated by these delivery giants. use social media, forums, and word of mouth to amplify our message.

2. **boycott third-party apps:** refuse to support grubhub, doordash, and uber eats. opt for alternative delivery options such as direct ordering from restaurants or using local delivery services. every dollar withheld from these corporations is a step towards dismantling their monopoly.

3. **support local businesses:** stand in solidarity with your favorite neighborhood restaurants. order directly from them whenever possible to ensure they receive the full value of your purchase. let's keep our communities vibrant and thriving.

4. **contact legislators:** advocate for fair regulations and policies that protect both restaurants and consumers from the predatory practices of third-party delivery apps. write to your local representatives, sign petitions, and participate in grassroots campaigns.

5. **raise awareness:** organize protests, rallies, and community events to raise awareness about the negative impact of third-party delivery apps. engage with local media outlets to amplify our message and hold these companies accountable.

together, we can reclaim control over our food delivery ecosystem and build a more equitable future for all. join the movement today and let's put an end to the reign of grubhub, doordash, and uber eats! 💪🍔🍕 #boycottbigdelivery #supportlocalrestaurants #takebackourfooddelivery",2024-05-05 11:04:24,0,55,Reddit,GrubHub
"can't even take a break i decided to take a couple weeks off from doing delivery. yesterday, which was a saturday, i thought i would do some delivery. my rating was pretty decent before i took the two weeks off. so, i log into my account and i look to see that my stats are all 0%. are you telling me that because of that i am now down to 0%? now, i have to drive around picking up shitty ass orders just to try and build that up? this is no longer worth it. i am probably better off doing delivery for an actual restaurant at this point.

"restaurants requiring signatures and fill out sheets and confirmation prior to releasing food just spoke with corporate kfc as we have a location doing this which has led to nasty interactions between me and them. one time where i did all that was required and verified with one worker and second worker wasn’t satisfied and wanted a screenshot of the order which i could not do because i already accepted with the previous worker. ended in a ghost delivery. second time, they wanted my name and signature on top of all order information. i put grubhub. they said no they want my name because they have that other info already to which i said, then why are you making me write it all down? i don’t work for you and if gh isn’t providing my name then you don’t need it. and then they wouldn’t release food without it. another ghost order. customers were understanding and just requested refunds and i advised to never order from that location again. 

i called corporate and they apologized and said they will be contacting the store to get rid of this system as it is not suppose to be happening. so if you’re experiencing this where you live i suggest calling their company’s corporate line and reporting them. 

the kicker to it all is the store manager didn’t want to give me her name after i told her i’m reporting their store to corporate 😭 also i decided if i run into this again i’m signing my name as ligma johnson and i suggest you do the same 😭",2024-05-04 22:47:03,5,22,Reddit,GrubHub

"does a big tip cause a problem for drivers?   serious question.  am i causing a problem by tipping more?  i use grubhub almost daily because i have a disability.   i am lucky enough to be able to afford it and i also know that i treat the service differently than a typical customer because of my disability.   i don't tip the 20% or 30% as a rule,  unless it comes out to at least $8 because i know it's a service for the delivery not a service restaurant tip.  my general rule is that it's a $10 tip.  and i also try to make sure that i only order from less than a mile away.

key important details:  i am a ""no contact customer""  and i don't use a cell phone,  so it's supposed to be that they just leave it at the door and send a text.  but i never see the text until later.

i've had two issues recently that made me wonder if i'm actually causing a problem for the driver.   so just now i ordered from dunkin and got two things and gave a $20 tip just thinking,  ""hey, let me start someone's day out great!""

the problem i've seen is that if i tip more than the actual cost of the items  (the cost was $14.59)  it seems to cause a delay?     

i usually want to make sure any driver gets at least $10 tip for the delivery,  and then whatever extra grub hub pays.   so i sometimes order a lot of things just to jack up the tip.   but i feel like it's a waste of money and i'd rather just make the drivers day and give them the extra money in the tip.

is this causing some unseen problem that i don't realize?   
also,  do the drivers know that i'm a reliable customer based on my address?

but today, on friday, i went into grubhub and did my first order and then saw that i had an adjustment pay that was equal to the amount that i didn’t receive on wednesday. it’s been almost half an hour since i finished my order, and i’m trying to cash it out but i can’t. in the cash out, it looks as though it hasn’t passed the 15 minute mark and that it’s not eligible for cash out, but it’s been over a half an hour… i’m so confused on what the fuck is going on and have received zero response from grubhub. no notifications and no emails. is there a certain duration of time before you can cash out the adjustment pay? does anyone have any advice?

"what does this symbol mean? .)

i’ve seen someone explain it on here a while ago but i cannot remember the actual comments. 

just had a dude order some alcohol and a sandwich and when i get to his house, no answer so i returned the alcohol to the store. 

got the order again a few minutes later with that symbol instead of a letter for the last name and low and behold, dude wasn’t answering phones or calls from support so it was cancelled again. crazy! thanks 🙏 ",2024-04-26 03:56:31,1,4,Reddit,GrubHub

"canceled after delivery? why are customers allowed to cancel an order after i’ve already completed the delivery? this has happened twice now. several minutes after  i’ve delivered the order and driven away, i get a notification that the order was canceled and that i should not deliver it. what do they want me to do? go back and retrieve it from the customer? this seems like such an obvious scam to get free food. i just don’t understand why gh allows this.

so has grubhub lowered their base pay for drivers or are people just tipping like crap lately? i just noticed the last couple weeks in my market that the average order pay out for me has dropped significantly. i've also noticed they have been expecting me to drive much longer distances for even less pay. ,2024-04-25 19:28:04,19,58,Reddit,GrubHub
"almost scammed out of a weeks earnings.  so last week i got a phone call and the caller id was the same as any other grubhub call. the person identified themselves as grubhub and told me there was a complaint against my account that said i did not look like the driver who is supposed to pick up the order. they said i needed to verify some information and they would cancel the order. i was headed to pick up and replace it immediately with another order after the verification process was done. i pulled over and started to deal with him on the issue now keep in mind they had my phone number and my email address and the order i was on did get canceled. this gave me the impression it was a legitimate call and i needed to take care of it.  i was sent an email and asked to verify some information from my account. after replying to the email, i was told i would be sent another email with a new password to be used until my payout on thursday. that was the part that made me feel this might be a little sketchy, but given the fact that while i was doing all this, they had a lot of my information already so i proceeded with their instructions. when i log back into my account, i immediately received another order which was a double pick up paying better and i ended the call and proceeded with my day.  in the back of my mind, it bothered me that they provided the password for me to use and they asked me not to do a cash out until i get paid on thursday.  a little voice in my head told me this seemed slightly sketchy and i needed to keep checking my account, specifically my bank information.  sunday night after i finished my last block for the week i was sitting at home and around 2 am. i started getting massively spammed on my email account.  i’m talking about well over 100 emails in rapid succession from places i’ve never been to online. thankfully, my initial reaction was to go to my grubhub account and check my account information again.  well, wouldn’t you know it? my bank information had been changed to a different routing number and account number. i immediately logged out changed my password logged back in and changed my bank information back to my account. thankfully, grubhub puts a 72 hour hold on any payouts after your account information is changed, i had to wait three days for them to re-verify my banking information on thursday morning my bank account where i discovered i did receive my pay.  the way i figured it was they spammed my email to cover the fact that i did receive an email from grubhub. alerting me that my bank information had been changed.

be careful folks , scammerah’s getting just enough information to sound legit can really ruin your day.

"instant cashout issues for anyone else? i tried to instant cash on saturday night. after pressing the button, an error occured and a message reading ""unavailable previous cashout is currently pending"" now appears in that section of the app. not only is my previous cashout in limbo between grubhub and my bank account, but i'm now unable to do any further instant cashouts from my subsequent earnings. 

i called support twice. first time they said they would put in a ticket and i should try again in an hour to see if the feature was restored. several hours passed without result, so i called again. this time they acknowledged it was a widespread issue that was affecting many drivers, and that i should keep checking the app to see if it was fixed.

that was the real problem and i told grubhub about it more than a month ago. i figured that out when i had an add-on at the same restaurant like 2 months ago and the first drop off support completed for me and then the second pick up came up with the arrived at restaurant button which i couldn't do of course at that point.

"stolen food (again)! for a while i swore off using grubhub because i had an order stolen back in december (not the first time). i relented and started using their service again after a couple months, mostly without incident. today, i placed a large order for myself and a friend. the driver arrived within 10 minutes of the order being placed and waited for them to complete the order. i made sure to keep a close eye on the map.

once completed, she took the food and immediately called grubhub to say someone else picked up the order (the cancelation cited the restaurant didn't have certain menu items, so they canceled it). when i called the restaurant to inquire i was told that the driver (they gave me her name and it was the same name of the driver assigned to my order), picked up the order herself and that the order was complete (no missing items).

i really can't stand some bum loser who wants to take from others because they have nothing. i was refunded and given a credit as well, but the fact that this person strolled off with my food makes me incredibly ticked off. ",2024-04-21 18:11:01,1,8,Reddit,GrubHub
