order got removed for taking too long to arrive grubhub on some bs i swear they be doing anything to make sure you don’t get a bonus. everytime i’m doing a bonus i have an issue and it’s always on the last order before getting it. was doing a mission that was earn $20 by doing 6 deliveries and only skipping 1. i got a delivery where the restaurant was 29 min away i wouldn’t normally have done it but it was the 6th delivery and i already skipped 1 so i just wanted that 20 but first the order pickup time was at 11:36 when i received the order at 11:30 but it was 29 min away then 20 min into drive i get a message saying i was running late for pickup start driving to restaurant then 2 min later it got removed.  actually some bs i’ve done orders where the pickup was 30 min away before and it didn’t do that and why tf was the pickup time 5 min after receiving order with them knowing i was 30 away. just wasted my time and gas for nothing and lost the mission and ofc support is no help them scummy indian scammers. ,2025-04-19 23:45:25,Reddit,GrubHub,4,15,

"deep cuts: acceptance % while on shift if you play the scheduling game while working, you probably know that you need a 90% acceptance rate in order to receive your minimum shift pay. a lot of people think that means you need to accept 9 out of every 10 offers, and if you skip an offer, you need to hit those other 9 if you want your minimum. however it’s not quite that simple.

for instance, say you’re scheduled for a 10 hour day, which here means you would be guaranteed $150 with 90% or more acceptance.

now let’s say your day was super slow, and you took 8 offers, and skipped 1. the offers that you took were $2-5 pay for long distances, and you’re only looking at like $32 for the day unless you get that last order.

now you get the 10th offer for the day right at the end of your shift, with maybe an hour left of the night. it’s for $3, and it’s a delivery right across the street from the restaurant, but the restaurant is 12 miles away. 

since you know this will be your last order to get your guarantee, then you know that this order is actually worth $118, and so you suck it up and take the order, and you get home 45 minutes late. you wake up in the morning, and see that you have $35 for the day and your acceptance is at 89%. oops. so what happened?

well your acceptance % actually seems to be calibrated by *distance* accepted, or the % of miles you are willing to drive, out of miles offered. so in this case, your total miles driven for the day were very high, but the final order you accepted was right across the street, so it didn’t accumulate a full 10% of your miles for the day. even though you drove all the way across town to get to the restaurant, the miles counted are only between the restaurant and the customer.

so moral of the story, don’t zonk out and forget to check your % before logging out for the day, or you’ll be a broke bitch like me. good night.

tldr: acceptance % is based on accepted driving amount from the store to the customer, not the number of orders accepted.",2025-04-18 20:27:18,Reddit,GrubHub,0,6,

"aita grubhub edition i'm a substitute teacher that does gig apps like grubhub on the side. i've only ever done about 5 gh orders though, as i mainly do ic and dd. i rarely order through these apps, but i missed lunch at the school i was working at and used gh to order from a place about 12 miles from the school. i usually tip around $8-10 for any orders i place, but i've been low on funds and tipped $6. in my limited experience, gh base pay was usually better than dd's, so i figured a $6 tip wasn't too bad.

long story short, i was dealing with students and had missed a text from my driver asking for the code. i told them to leave it in the lobby in the app and tried to make sure all the instructions were correct. i wasn't aware that gh requires a code now. the driver called me and i answered immediately and saw the text was from 2 minutes prior. 

i was able to see the lobby entrance from my classroom. it was a man on the profile and calling, but i only saw a woman come in with food, so i didn't think he had even arrived yet. i answered and the guy said ""this is grubhub what's the code?"" and i politely asked ""are you in the lobby?"". he said ""nah shit, what's the code"" super aggressively and i just hung up. i was already overwhelmed dealing with unruly students, and that almost sent me over the edge. i waited a minute and he texted ""give me the code or your order will be cancelled"" and i finally texted it to him. i would've given him the code immediately if he had just said said ""yes i am in the lobby"" but his whole demeanor threw me off. i got my food, but gave him a 2 star for the way he spoke on the phone.

aita here? i did some research on gh base pay later that day, and i see now that a $6 tip on a 12 mile delivery isn't that greatest tip. i will admit that i messed up not giving the code when he first texted, but i was watching out for him and he never even entered the building. i'm open to any feedback in case a situation like this arises in the future.

"driver incentive programs: ridiculous offers i don't play the acceptance rate game. but i was curious, so i did a test. since grubhub only counts the previous two weeks in our stats, i decided to see what the highest level of their program means. i did this, by only going online each week just enough to hit the highest level. now, the current week's activity does not show until the following monday. 

i noticed that as i have technically qualified but it hasn't shown up yet that the system then starts to send me outrageously ridiculous orders. orders that it never would've sent me before. i started receiving orders to go into a different city/county pick up and deliver an order for $8.00 at 20 miles. then i received another order to go into another city/county for $7 and some change for 21 miles.

i am aware that if the system thinks i am going for one of their missions then it will always offer ridiculous offers if i am getting close to succeeding. those missions haven't been worth it for a couple of years now so i don't even bother with them anymore. but if i accidentally get close to succeeding in one of those missions just by doing what i usually do then it will send me terrible offers until i no longer qualify for that mission; in hopes i will compromise and take the offer. the system does track us. 

the picture that i've attached, shows a different, absolutely ridiculous offer that it sent because come the following monday i would've qualified fully for their premier program. the system wanted me to go from the city/county where i was at into a different city/county to pick up pizza from little caesars, then travel to a third city/county and drop the little caesars off. by the way, there is a little caesars in that city where the drop off would be.

for those who don't understand, these are the games that all of the food delivery apps play when it comes to their ""driver incentive programs."" there is a psychological conditioning these companies are doing to get drivers to behave like trained monkeys. their game is to be as manipulative as possible, create hope in the possibility of more money, establish a sense of desperation and then pounce. they dangle a carrot in front of a hungry mule as they are riding on its back.

it is sad to see so many drivers believe that those programs offer true value.

edit: it's understandable that i have received negative feedback on this post. unfortunately, many who now do gig work have never experienced what back-end management in a company looks like and the factors that they consider when creating and releasing a program. the goal is always to improve profitability in the company, but when creating a program the participants must ""feel like"" there is a value in it for them in order for them to participate. these companies have shareholders, and they must please their shareholders. to believe that these incentive programs are meant to benefit the driver demonstrates a lack of understanding of what actually happens in the background.

this, of course, does not mean that a driver cannot benefit from these programs, but it is highly unlikely, in many cases, there will be a true long-term benefit for the driver.

this post is my experience; in my marketplace. there is no long-term benefit for me in that program. ",2025-04-16 19:22:46,Reddit,GrubHub,8,25,

i am just angry at this point and see them bag the first item of my order and tell them a new driver will be in to pick this one up. they say its almost done and i said i know but im not doing this you know how long i've been here. she apologizes and says the system puts deliveries at the end and i said im not mad at you guys but im not delivering the order after waiting that long for them to even start it. 

unassigned and walked out. really tired of places being this way.

tried just waiting many times for a couple hours and nothing.  then when i finally get an offer, it's always right after a split in the road that requires a long detour because of the lane i'm committed to.  

for example, on the freeway, i just passed the exit that would have made economical sense to accept the offer im getting but now adding 10 minutes, 5 miles and rating penalty to almost every delivery.  ",2025-04-08 13:59:44,Reddit,GrubHub,4,18,
"more ridiculousness... i have experienced many app glitch  issues recently of a variety of natures involving assigned orders, washout, and inaccuracy/timeliness of orders being ready at the merchant, acceptance rate tracking %, and double orders that get stuck and you can't accept and therefore you have to call 3 separate times to a sorry customer service to get released in the app to proceed meanwhile you are losing valuable orders and time.  i have also been in danger delivering to orders over the last several nights and you have to argue with customer servuce to file a report which they never due.  i have being getting to restaurants late night and tney regularly have no record of the orders.

now, these customer service jokers want you to file all this yourself which can affect your metrics and result in violations.

this all started with their recent system update several weeks ago.

let's hope the one that shows up this morning does anything but cause more issues.

such a sorry, sorry excuse for a company!!!!  with the wear and tear on the car and price of gas, you really can only do this job in certain markets.

it is fundamentally flawed and unfair and heavily schews toward the company profits and customers.  has nothing to add or help their internal customers- us drivers.  if you can do this job part time and learn to patchwork through their algorithm of lies and deceit, then only, for a short period, does it make sense....

you can never reach a supervisor and they never call back and none of these so called departments have i ever heard from via email in regards to adjustments on my account.

the last straw for me is glitches at cashout and then telling me sorry and we don't why and it should be directly deposited to your account later in the week.

you don't mess with people's hard earned money!!!!

so i finally get the order and i’m walking all the way back to my car and halfway there the person cancels the order. i had waited like 20 minutes to get the order. so of course with grubhub, i get just under $4 payment. maybe i’ll get more from prop 22..

if i have been able to park close to the restaurant, i would’ve already marked leaving by the time the person canceled.

"q: can grubhub reassign a different driver for an order or is it truly automated? if i may ask because i just want to make sure that the chat help gave me the correct info. tonight i ordered a meal from let’s say o’charley’s. someone takes the order. however, the map is showing that they drove to a restaurant location approximately 5 miles to the west of my house. the order is being prepared by a location approximately 5 miles east of my house. taking into account they may be picking up other orders, it’s still confusing as to why they would accept my order because they literally have to drive back, past my house, several more miles to the restaurant, and then back to me.

that’s a lot of driving for a simple order. i don’t know if they may have got confused and went to the wrong location seeing the restaurant name? i’m in metro atl so there are tons of drivers in the area who would’ve been a lot closer to the restaurant and me to pick this order up. could the app have given the driver the wrong location information?

either way once it became a parent that was going to take a lot longer to get the order i did chat help to see if it could be assigned to a different driver because she wasn’t even halfway to the other location yet. but they told me it’s all automated and that this isn’t possible. since i don’t know exactly how this works just curious if this is true or not?

update: driver eventually made their way to the correct restaurant but picked up a completely different customers order and brought me that customers order. chat help was no good. i was however able to reach the driver who claims she is picking it back up. called the restaurant to have them look out. i appreciate her going back if she indeed does but there’s no way to track it on the app at this point. we’ll see what happens but this particular order wound up being a real s show.",2025-03-20 19:06:55,Reddit,GrubHub,2,15,

she also said - she already informed gh about it thru the app.

called gh - associate was nice to begin with but his niceness ended there. he said wait for the 2nd order??? 

i said - 1st order food might get cold and customer may not be happy. he said not a problem??? but if you want to unassign your ratings will be affected???

i used my common sense and unassigned just to take care of quality of food for 1st customer.

folks what kind of world gh is living in? - so i compromised on my ratings to make gh customer happy... even though i was premier ...

why gh is so possessive of ratings and are driver ratings more important then making customers happy?

"so do program levels even mean anything? i've been delivering grubhub here and there on the side for a couple years now but have only recently started consistently delivering each week. i learned about program levels and decided to gun for premier level, and was excited that i managed to keep everything at 100% for a week. based off of what i'd read there were a bunch of perks to being above partner level, but i haven't seen the fruits of my labor yet. 

tonight has been without a doubt one of the worst nights i've ever delivered. i kept getting orders that were roughly upwards of $8 all the way down to one order that was $2.76 for over 5 miles. there were multiple orders around the $3 range. i had a block from 7-9:30pm and right before i was set to clock out at 9:30 i got a barrage of orders. normally i would have been fine with working a little later than planned but the first order was sub-$3 from mcdonald's, the second and third order was from burger king, both for $2.98 (probably the same order thrown at me twice.) i decided to ignore those orders because i could not mentally handle that low of prices after already dealing with sub-$3 orders earlier so i ignored them, and as a result my acceptance rate plummeted.

that absolutely set me off. it felt like i was having better nights when i was at partner level. do program levels even mean anything or are they just a scam to encourage drivers to complete orders even if they're throwing $3 orders at you non-stop?",2025-03-15 22:03:25,Reddit,GrubHub,9,22,

"deactivated not my fault just a rant: 
i get a lot of orders on a military base. after spending an entire day turning them down, and receiving no other orders off base, i decided to just go for it. so i started taking base orders and got into the habit of calling or texting the diner to meet me at the gate, as per grubhub policy. sometimes the diners don't want to meet at the gate so i have to call support to cancel the order. now i've noticed some support staff simply cancel the order and some tell me to mark it as delivered. they literally told me to mark the order as delivered and dispose of the food. after getting two violations for this i started arguing with support telling them i don't want to mark it as delivered because i'll get a third violation. so support staff marked the orders as delivered for me! but alas here is am with three violations and a banned account for simply doing what support told me to do. i've filed an appeal but they say it can take 14 days and that's a long time with no work. maybe after all it is my fault for doing grubhub to begin with. it seems doordash and uber blocked ordering on military bases already. i wonder if gh ever will, or renew their contract to allow us to get base access!!!

"how much do you make per delivery (on average)? do you think it's fair? hi everyone. i'm a small youtuber who is making a video about why services like ubereats and grubhub tend to be really expensive. in my research i've found that the delivery drivers really get the short end of the stick and that the company takes most of the profit.

i was wondering a few things:

- is it true that the parent company kind of screws you over?

- how important is tipping to your livelihoods?

- do you think it is worth all the effort you put in?

- what would be a better or more fair way to properly compensate delivery drivers for their time and work?

- how often do you believe you get a proper tip? 

- what is tip baiting and has it happened to you? and how do parents companies protect you from practices like tip baiting?

i'd be grateful for any and all answers. when making this video, i'm trying to be as transparent as possible and get information right from the source. 

any other information you'd like to provide about your experience as a driver or how you're treated is also welcome.

i'm sorry if this isn't the right place to ask questions! thank you all for you time and for your effort as drivers!",2025-03-11 19:42:09,Reddit,GrubHub,10,36,

"i love gh. some people thrive in chaos. been on the beat for exactly 2 months.  been working alot of hours, but have never failed to make less than $900 in a week in about 60 hrs of driving time.

in my market gh is a distant 3rd and no one wants to drive for them.  the app sucks and im constantly picking up food that has been sitting for an hour.

gh pays the same as the other 2, but my market is full of big tippers ordering shu-shu food fron shu-shu-foo-foo restaurants.

thats fine with me.  i care not about the customer nor gh and as long as the situation remains the same i will do it.

reason no one wants to do it here?  a downtown territory with 50 floor skyscrapers.  3 draw bridges that seem like they open hourly and a traffic nightmare i have never seen anywhere else.

so, i suck up the scraps and gladly do it.  2 months ago i was barely getting by.  today all my bill are paid and there $125 in my savings (more to come).  if i can out up with this crap for 6 months my whole financial reality qill have been rearranged in a few short months.

so, keep up the crap gh.  don't hire any more drivers and don't improve the app.  keep things exactly they way they are.

... some people thrive in chaos!

here is the thing, my building has a driveway where you can leave your car for a few min to run up. i reached out to grubhub and removed the tip (which was more than decent - $9 on a $20 order). am i a jerk for doing that or am i in the right here? i somewhat feel bad because i’ve never done that before but this seemed pretty lazy on his part?",2025-02-27 23:51:38,Reddit,GrubHub,6,29,
blocks and out of zone..? so the text message that pops up about an hour before your block starts. so make sure you have the app turned on and then you are in your zone.. now if you are already active and taking orders and an order happens to take you about a good 30 to 45 minutes outside of your zone and you do not make it back to your zone when your block starts. will you get a violation for this? i usually try not to take orders that take me out of the zone. although those are the better paying before my block starts because nine times out of 10 there's no way i can make it back when it is starting. i would really like to take these orders but i'm worried that i might get a violation for it.,2025-02-27 22:31:52,Reddit,GrubHub,7,13,

"my food keeps getting stolen by the drivers with the same method i've had two orders stolen by different drivers within these last few weeks. i live in a building complex with an elevator, a guard, two automatic double-door entrances and security cameras.

i've seen the footage. the driver simply drops the bag on the floor between the two doors (after the first door, but before the locked intercom door). they take a picture of the bag on the ground and simultaneously ring the apartment number. then, they immediately pickup the bag and walk back to their car.

i've contacted grubhub and they said that without proof they won't do anything except refund or re-order for me. it takes me ages, if i'll even be successful, to get cctv footage from my building's administration, and i'm afraid that at one point if this keeps happening, grubhub won't refund me anymore thinking i'm some scammy user.

anecdote:

i've read on other posts on this sub that drivers are ""hungry"" or that its tip/wage related (not that it's an excuse). even if that were true, the foods that were stolen from me this splurge and also previous times were ""*sexy*"" foods like fast-food, fries, iced coffee, etc. when it's a vegetable soup you can bet they don't steal it. i assume someone who doesn't have daily access to food would rather steal something filling and with actual substance?

"wow!… and grubhub only holds 6% of the market!!!! uber sues doordash over alleged anti-competitive practices

uber has filed a lawsuit against its food delivery competitor, doordash, accusing the company of anti-competitive tactics that inflate costs for both restaurants and customers. the complaint alleges that doordash makes it difficult and expensive for restaurants to partner with multiple delivery services, ultimately allowing it to charge higher fees while providing what uber calls “lower-quality service.”

the lawsuit claims doordash’s dominance in the industry—holding 62.7% of the u.s. delivery market, compared to uber eats’ 25% and grubhub’s 6.2%—gives it excessive power over restaurants. some business owners reportedly feel pressured to stick with doordash, fearing financial consequences if they seek other delivery options.

in response, doordash dismissed uber’s claims as “meritless,” asserting that its success comes from providing superior service. a 2024 mystery shopper study backs this up, ranking doordash highest in customer satisfaction, promotions, and delivery accuracy. the report also found doordash had the fastest average delivery time at 26 minutes and 24 seconds, while grubhub averaged 35 minutes and 49 seconds, and uber eats lagged behind at 38 minutes and 4 seconds.

despite ongoing concerns over high fees, the demand for third-party food delivery remains strong. doordash reported an 18% increase in orders year-over-year in q3 2024, with revenue rising 25% to $2.7 billion. however, uber hopes its lawsuit will force doordash to change its business practices, giving restaurants more freedom to choose their delivery partners without fear of retaliation.",2025-02-20 04:51:01,Reddit,GrubHub,16,34,

"rude staff interaction at a curbside only place. should i just let it go or maybe see if she continues to be nasty to me at the next pickup? basically the curbside only place is laid out where it's in the middle of three other buildings at a strip mall kind of place where there's three blue painted parking spots technically just for them... but everybody uses a parking spots in the row around it just for them.

but today i got a storming pissed off bus girl stomping over to my passenger side window instead of my side to snap at me for not using one of the blue parking spaces that i could not see was open. and the staff that comes out always checks every single parking spot. so naturally i just park on one of the left slightly center spaces open.

it was also that kind of ranting person where like even if you're calm and say okay and sorry and it won't happen again they just keep going for you to do it next time... she was pissed because she said this causes the restaurant to not know we're here even though like i said, every other waiter there immediately checks every car that pulls in to that row when she claims they only check for the blue spaces... she was quite the rotund lady so i wondered if that was a factor...

they also usually go up to your driver window to talk and give you the food but she just kept coming to my passenger window, further getting angry because i reclosed it thinking she'd come to the driver side with the food... then as soon as it's open again, and i reach for the bag with a polite ""thank you."" she says nothing, gives me a dirty look and  reaches in and like does a slam dunk downward toss with the food bag into my open delivery bag resting in the passenger seat! hilariously she didn't do it hard enough to do absolutely any damage to the styrofoam.

i yell back at her in a customer service ass kisser tone: ""thank you! sorry!"" and i get a loud ""do your job!!!"" that makes the people waiting in the other cars immediately look her way awkwardly. the tone she first gave me lecturing me about parking kind of felt like she herself was getting an ear-full by her boss and found a way to lash.",2025-02-15 03:42:09,Reddit,GrubHub,3,3,

"i think i've noticed that a man karen diner that was probably removed from grubhub is back on a different name. tl;dr - i recognized a problem customer from a long time ago is back on a different name and using the code drop off system. i keep hearing here that code drop-offs are either for new customers or problematic customers that always complain or get refunds?

\-----

basically 2 years ago i had this problem diner where it was a weird disheveled couple where every single time i dropped off an order they would meet me at the door and then follow me to my car while one of them inspects the food and every single time one of them would step in front of my car as they complain that absolutely every single time, something about their food was wrong. then i would have to go through a song and dance every single time of showing them what grubhub said was on the order and it was always completely wrong from what they said should be on there and they'd always like keep asking me what i'm going to do about it and i keep telling them to just call customer care because it's the restaurant's fault...

this lasted for about 6 months or so and i haven't gotten an order from them up until tonight... they did the exact same thing and i recognized the house just as i pulled in and the only reason i even took the order in the first place was because it was for a completely new name- a guy's name instead of a girl's name and also curiously they now have them for a code drop off instead of photo drop off... and they held the code hostage until we did our song and dance again because their little caesars green chili and cheese pizza daring to have green chili on it and not ""green peppers"".

i can tell there's like something weird about them going on because they would just keep arguing circles with you until they got tired and went back in for 10 minutes or like they were obsessed with giving you a text saying there's a green pickup in their driveway and to deliver to the house of the green pickup then asking you once they meet you if you receive the text or not ""about the green pickup""... when their street address is just easy to get to on google maps without their weird pickup truck directions.",2025-02-13 20:41:25,Reddit,GrubHub,4,7,

but unintentionally so this guy who's clearly the 20s son of the owner keeps basically micromanaging the hell out of how i come in and get food. such as...

\* he has to get incredibly close to you while talking to him and does this even to people he waits on. also i must show him the offer on my phone and he has to get super close to the screen and examine it like it's a tax document.

\* he has to stack everything in a great big vertical tower in the bags, including soup bowls, but then turns around and orders me on how to carry them without spilling them even though i've been there like 190 times already.

\* recently started calling me a few minutes after accepting offers to his restaurant if i'm not there on the exact time, asking where i am and if i know i even accepted an offer for his restaurant. this also happens a lot when people hot potato cheap offers in the time ​gets extended.

\* whenever i have multiple orders to pick up. he absolutely must get close to me and go ""listen, listen, look here. (i literally have to look his way and at the receipts of the bags like i'm a child at school) this is bags for \[diner a\], this is bags for \[diner b\]! you go and you give food to both customers, understand...?"" in a hasty whispery tone... confoundingly he even does this if i already have one diner's order and he hands me the next one 5 minutes later when it's ready...

what sucks is that this restaurant is really expensive so i get more than 12 bucks every single order even for cheapos ordering just a miso soup. plus i get offers for this restaurant like sometimes 3 to at least once every day. also i really hate that i'm speculating about this, but as somebody who has worked with people on the spectrum... he's giving off a lot of telltale signs.",2025-01-31 23:22:05,Reddit,GrubHub,3,7,

"question for drivers i switched to grubhub from ubereats about 6 months ago (got tired of missing food not being refunded) & i have had a massive issue with drivers leaving my food on the ground. i have contactless disabled (confirmed with support & in app) & have delivery instructions stating ""do not leave food on ground. please ring doorbell"". i would 90% of my orders are left on the ground & no doorbell ring to let me know the food is here. i also tip well & based on how far away it is as well as what time of day (traffic). however, i end up messaging support & having them remove the tip because the driver didn't do the job they were hired to do. i rarely had that issue with ubereats (maybe a dozen times over the course of 5 years). what is it about grubhub that makes delivery drivers think it's ok to just drop the food on the dirty ground & leave?

eta: wow, y'all certainly went full peak unemployable here. instead of offering any kind of explanation as to why the experience is so different from other delivery services, you blamed the customer for the failure of the drivers to complete a simple task. i was feeling bad about dropping/nuking tips (why i wanted to know what was different) but not any more! if reading a few words & checking if 'contactless' is enabled is too much for you to handle, you might want to try unemployment. thank you to the few of you who messaged me or responded like responsible adults. to the rest? may you forever be without tips.

"confused - was this driver trying to scam me? hey y’all. i’m not a grubhub driver but am trying to understand something weird that happened tonight. i placed an order from a restaurant and then they called me to say their kitchen was closed and they’d cancel the order. fine, no big deal, i placed an order from somewhere else.

they didn’t cancel the order, a driver was assigned, and he went to the restaurant. when i saw that i texted him and said hey sorry, they told me the kitchen is closed and they’d cancel the order, and now the app won’t let me cancel it so i can’t do anything on my end.

he ended up “picking up” the order, drove all the way to my house, sat out front for a minute and then marked it as dropped off with a blurry picture from the street of the bag of food from the second restaurant, which had already been delivered.

i thought at first he was trying to pocket the tip without making the delivery… except he drove all the way here anyway. whether the kitchen somehow made the order after all or he faked the whole thing, i have no idea why he would have. does this make sense to anyone? i got a refund for order not delivered so at this point i’m just baffled, not trying to go on the warpath or anything.",2025-01-30 21:05:24,Reddit,GrubHub,11,13,

"worst conditions you have encountered at a delivery i know there are some horror stories out there, but what is the one delivery that sticks with you for being particularly bad?

up until tonight, the worst i had experienced  were some hard to find houses in the middle of the woods in areas without cell service (yes those exist in 2025 shockingly). a rude restaurant or customer or long waits. but i think tonight's tops anything i have had.   
  
about 3 miles into a 1 lane dirt road that was half plowed from the snow a week ago, i notice the road seems to be staying the same elevation but the houses appear to be getting higher and higher. i finally pull up to the address as the last house on the street, but cant see much of anything as theres no lights out. i take my flashlight out to survey the scene and nothing had been cleaned from the snow, street/driveway/walkway all packed down frozen solid ice. and thats just around their car. 

in front of that are about 30-40 stairs (no railings), same conditions, i'm wearing snowboots expecting this kind of stuff so i decide i will make the climb and i get to the top, and follow the path most walked, around the corner and up the stairs onto the deck, also, still nothing has been shoveled or cleaned or salted. the stairs are so caked with snow/ice that is almost a slide getting up and down. but when i reached the top, is when it takes an even worse turn... 

ontop of the, snow/ice packed deck thats not clean, is crap. lots of it. dog crap. as if they tie their dog on the deck all day long and leave it there. i can only estimate 10+ piles littering the entire way between the stairs and the door. upon seeing this. i dropped the food, took the photo with the crap visible, and sent a long text message after i slid down on my butt to my car (yes i actually did slip and fall at one point). i explained if they wanted better service in the future, turn lights on to help find the house especially if they refuse to provide a safe and sanitary environment to traverse to bring their food and that it posed a danger to even the fittest of drivers let alone those who may not be able to physically trek through those conditions.

having delivered for ups for a few years, i was tempted to leave the food on their car and just leave but was afraid of the consequences of that. i am still disgusted by this delivery hours later. so i turn it over to you lot. whats your delivery horror story? any advice for situations like this? have you ever gotten flak for confronting a customer or restaurant? i am not sure if i should worry about being de-activated for the text message or for speaking up when somethings not right.

"hot delivery advice/etiquette i always turn off ""contactless delivery"" and put in the notes to ring the doorbell, because i'm hoping to get my food before it's cold or soggy. i can't blame a driver for a s***** restaurant or bad traffic, but leaving the food sitting outside without a heads up is under their control, right? they don't even have to hand it to me, just make sure they see me pick it up before they drive away. i'll assume you came as quickly as you could. 5-stars, good tip.

everytime, the driver leaves it on my steps without a knock or a doorbell ring.

i'm a grubhub+ member living in a typical suburban house on a wide road near the highway. my door is ~30ft from the street with no steps or hazards. it's well lit. there's even room in the driveway if they want to pull in and save 15 steps.

i reliably tip 20% or more of the subtotal (before tax), and never less than $5 (like if it's a $8 sandwich, you're still getting $5 tip for your trouble even though that's 62.5%). i enter the tip at the time of purchase, and give good driver ratings unless something is missing from my order. i don't expect them to verify the toppings on a pizza or ingredients in a sandwich (because that's on the restaurant, but if the sandwich is missing entirely that feels like the driver should at least verify the # of items, right?

am i doing something wrong? is anything i am doing unreasonable?

is there something else i can do to get a courtesy knock/ring when my food arrives?

if i'm not in the wrong here, should i reduce my tip or my review, or contact customer service?",2025-01-25 13:55:44,Reddit,GrubHub,5,34,

i have a customer that i've been sent twice now. they live about 20 miles outside of my normal area, and they always have a 2 digit code. i get no response when i text them, and when i try to call i get a verizon message saying the number is no longer in service. no one answers the door either, but the second time i did notice that they have an old school camcorder set up so it peeks out from behind their curtains and can see the whole porch and driveway. i wrote a note on a spare napkin i had in my car asking them to either update the number in the app or turn of the security code option. oh, and of course they don't tip, either.

my bigger question is this: other than this customer, i've only had one other customer who i  couldn't get the code from. but each time, i can't just wait out the timer once, i have to wait like four or five times before it lets me mark the order complete. it lets me take a picture after the first time but won't give me the delivered slide until at least four times. i am wasting so much time sitting in these driveways when i could be getting more offers. has anyone else had this problem?",2025-01-25 02:26:16,Reddit,GrubHub,13,39,

i sympathized, since grubhub and doordash have done this to me as a customer.  it's fine for some foods, that travel well, like pizza, but there are some foods that don't benefit from being in my car for over an hour, like french fries.

" does grubhub marketablity affected by its name? ... i think that could be one of the reasons pulling the company down since it start going down.  for me 2 things are important on marketablity of the name brand, first it need to be easily memorizable in customers head preferably  made of noun words so people can picture it and remember it easily. second it got to be easily pronunciable name so people spread it around. grubhub fails in both things i didnt know what grubhub meant before somebody told me here grub means food, i thought maybe it meant hold something but that is spelled grab, most likely many people are like me they dont know what ""grub"" means so if you dont know word ""grub"" then grubhub doesnt make much sense. 
secondly it is least smooth to pronounce grubhub  than ""doordash""  ""ubereats"". they should have made better marketing  job had they named for example ""eatshub"" or something everybody knows word  ""eat"". and easier to pronounce what you guys think?",2025-01-19 04:09:31,Reddit,GrubHub,0,13,

however , when i goto restaurants to pick up for ubereats i see tons of grubhub orders just sitting . even if i’m waiting at a popular restaurant i can see multiple grubhub orders waiting and i still won’t get a ping.

i’m just curious how does grubhub work for people mainly or only driving for grubhub. it does not seem sustainable for me but i see multiple people on here in smaller markets making consistent money every day.

i live in the middle of a huge metro area and i can’t control random areas of hard hitting traffic no matter what time of the day it is. and it annoys me that there is no way to inform gh that there is actually heavy traffic and it’s not me being lazy.

because of this, i have stopped doing dinner rush blocks between 5-7pm because my arrival time percentage gets killed every single time. the other day i couldn’t get for the restaurant on time because there was an accident and an ambulance blocking the road!

does anyone have suggestions? i’m not multi-apping because i prefer gh: it actually keeps me in my “zone” while delivering and the pay is actually decent on most orders. i schedule blocks 4-5 times a week to work around my current full time job so i do the best i can.

there's a sonic here that has a messed up computer, and if someone orders even one thing that they're currently out of stock on, it creates an error message on the entire order and has to be cancelled. 

for example, if they're out of m&ms, and they put in an order for m&ms on their ice cream, the entire order comes back an error and needs to be cancelled. 

always i got 2 such orders this week, called support, and support was the one that cancelled them after calling the restaurant to verify. 

i still got a violation for too many orders cancelled this week because there's an arbitrary threshold of 15% or more, and because it's been slow i haven't actually gotten many gh orders this week, so those 2 very legit cancellations that weren't even my fault are counted against me.

"drivers struggle to find my place. what can i do about it? as title, my place is in a little complex. what should be a very simple drop off is made \*excessively\* difficult for the drivers, for no good reason.

while the address on the application is correct, the ""pin"" it drops for drivers to go to is way off. it takes drivers far too deep into the complex when i'm right at the front of it. 

the net result is that i end up having to watch my order like a hawk, and pray that the driver will respond to communication attempts, which half of them dont. 

i do have delivery drop off instructions that i edit all the time, trying for more/better clarity... but honestly? at this point i'm wondering if people are even reading it. i've tried all caps, practically begging... 100% of drivers go all the way to the back of the complex and spend 5-10 minutes there before either a) ditching the order or b) figuring it out. 

  
again, i'd like to reiterate that i dont live in some high rise or the like... it's not complicated, the place is literally just right there when you pull in but the marker is wrong. it's just idk how else to try and communicate or if i'm just barking up the wrong tree but i'm out of ideas at this point.

kicking off the new year with a bang. another year of gh contribution. ,2025-01-06 03:54:04,Reddit,GrubHub,24,63,
"time to take action against the on time arrival at merchant metric!!! i and many other drivers have been complaining to gh for almost two years, ever since they introduced this ridiculous on time arrival at merchant metric about the ridiculously short on time arrival at merchant metric, which is dragging all of us, who are working hard to maintain our premier level status.  here is my plan of action.  on february 8 of this year, i am invited to a ronald reagan birthday dinner, where there will be prominent indiana politicians, including the lt governor and some state representatives.  i will be calling for a law to be passed in the indiana general assembly that would outlaw the enforcement of such a metric for all trucking and delivery companies which would carry hefty fines of a significant percentage of a given companies net worth if they don't comply.  we cannot single out gh, it has to apply to all delivery and trucking companies.  i plan on also contacting the teamster's union to get the truckers on our side as it was the trucking companies that started this metric, causing truckers to get pay cuts for arriving late to pick up or drop off their loads.  i need some of you drivers to do the same in your respective states and maybe even try to get a federal law passed.

  
1) contact your state representative and state senator.  let them know that an on time arrival metric is dangerous, as it promotes dangerous driving, running red lights, etc.

2) on time arrival metrics has caused truckers to drive erratically, making the interstates more dangerous for all .

3) it is only a matter of time for a delivery driver to have an accident due to on time arrival metrics, thus causing our insurance rates to go up.

  
locate and contact your local truckers unions.  the truckers could be our best allies on this issue, and they have had to deal with these kinds of metrics for a long time, affecting their pay checks.

  
look up attorneys in your area who advertise litigation of accidents caused by these kinds of metrics from trucking companies.  

  
if we all work together, we can force gh to get rid of this on time arrival at merchants metric, and not just gh, but all delivery and trucking companies.  i will be organising a zoom call after that feb 8 dinner to get drivers organise.  feel free to leave your comments and if you wish to contact me. private message me.",2025-01-06 02:53:32,Reddit,GrubHub,0,45,
"is it just me!?…or are there other gh delivery drivers that have recently started getting the most absolutely insulting $$ offers $$… (if any at all!?!?!?)  ok so today marks my 3rd night in a row, that i rejected more offers than i delivered…. aaaaand it’s the weekend!?!? friday nights offers were all so low & far and few between, from 5pm -11pm i was only given 3offers all night and all 3offers were between $2-$4 dollars!?!? i ended up making no deliveries because i refused to accept any of these 3 insulting offers! so i made no money and was in the negative now for $ spent on gas… but it had to be a fluke, right!? just a really bad night!!!??? right!? ….soooo to my surprise,i couldn’t even believe how slow last night was. a saturday night, in boston, ma… a major metropolitan city & a 24hour open market, i worked from 3:00pm to 11:30pm, hoping to make a little extra since friday was so bad for me… but ended up getting screwed over a 2nd time & even worse, not only did i only receive 5 delivery offers in those 8 1/2 hours, but to add insult to injury not even one offer was for more $6.!!!! my largest payment of the night being $5.84 for 2.9miles! which i only accepted because i was getting desperate & i low key was hoping if i at least accepted something maybe the algorithm would send me more offers!? or better offers!? ( which i now know was stupid, cause if you accept nothing for pay, then all they will offer you is nothing for pay!!!!!) now i know some people will come at me saying $5.84 for 2.9miles isn’t a bad offer at all… but working in the city most of the time all my deliveries stay within .5-1.5miles of each other all night/shift! typically (and depending on gas prices) i usually don’t accept any offers tht are less than $3 a mile minimum! my theory is tht i won’t accept any payment that doesn’t at the very least cover the price i pay for gas to drive that mile! then to top off my weekend, tonight a sunday, i worked 5pm-11pm and got, you ready for this… drumroll pleasssssse!!!!!….. “2”…. yup u heard it two whole offers all nite! i guess i should be grateful tht one offer for $6.75 because the first offer of the night i got was $2.14….. i’m just at a loss!!!! i really need the extra $ i was making w deliveries, but this is crazy!!! ….in massachusetts min. wage is &15.75, so my offers and hours should at the very least equal out to that for pay per hour at the end of my shift! ( …ohhh and gh contribution pay wants no part of having to pay is tht much, so on the very few times i didn’t make enough on my scheduled blocks and received gh contribution pay, by the end of tht week i’d be punished and have my scheduling restricted , i fought and appealed and won it back twice, but by the 3rd time it happened i didn’t feel it was even worth the fight, now i work when i want accept or reject what i want and i was happy and doing well until recently! i’ve been with gh for close to 2 years now & other than gh contribution pay screwing me out of scheduling blocks, i’ve been really happy working for them…  but now i just feel insulted… i know wonder just bought gh out,i’m just really hoping this isn’t gonna be their standard… as long as drivers accept $2 offers tho, that’s what they’ll offer and that’s who they’ll pay!!!! i just feel defeated! thanks for listening to my rant guys!!! hope your weekends paid out better than mine!!! ( ….although i did keep seeing posts that people were unable to use instant cash out at all today too…. soooo first they insult us with their pay offers aaand then they don’t even allow you ur insulting pay!!! nice!!!!! …..it just s-cks cause gh really used to be such a great company to wrk for, of all the delivery apps they made u feel appreciated & valued!!! now…. not even in the slightest!!!! ) do better grubhub!!!do better!!!",2025-01-06 01:35:40,Reddit,GrubHub,19,28,

with doordash (and ubereats) you'll most often get a pickup that's at least near you with a delivery further away.

"not telling customers that drivers have a delivery ahead of them is making my job harder  this is happening frequently at an area near the airport with many hotels, thus, lots of hotel deliveries.  tonight was the third time that i've had both customers in a stack (each at a hotel about a mile apart) checking on me about their food, **oblivious** to the fact i have multiple pickups and dropoffs.  i wish gh would inform them that it's in a stack, and whether they'll be the first or second dropoff.   i'm constantly on the phone texting them back and forth while i'm trying to just drive.   

edit:  i didn't mean literally texting and driving illegally, just whatever chance i had to answer texts during stoplights and such",2024-12-29 02:41:27,Reddit,GrubHub,27,9,

"selling/loaning my gh account (just got accepted two days ago) has anyone had any experience with “selling” their grub hub account? heres my situation. i applied in lafayette, in. i was living there temporarily at the time (originally from california), after waiting on the waitlist and completed my background check and driving record check, i was accepted and officially a gh driver on the the 26th of december (just a couple days ago). however! during the time i was waiting to be approved, i had moved back to california. so when i tried to start delivering, it kept saying i was out of my market region. i’ve spoke to several gh care representatives. (ha! “care”) who i think need to find themselves a new name or new job because they definitelyyyyy don’t care about us at all. but after speaking to them, they told me i have to complete at least 20 deliveries in my region before applying to relocate and change my region. indiana is 2000 miles away from california. that’s not happening. i’ve asked for supervisors i’ve asked for the legal department. i’ve asked for a one time override of the policy no exceptions they said. so my post is either too. i guess sell? my account? lol do people do that? or find someone in lafayette, indiana that would be willing to do my 20 deliveries so i can apply for relocation. you’d be able to keep whatever money you make using my account obviously.

"multiple orders hi, newbie here! as i was picking up order 1 (pizza) they offered me an add on order (chinese) which was right across the street, so i accepted it. i picked up the pizza and headed to grab the chinese. the chinese order wasn’t ready, they said it’d be 15 minutes. i waited the 15, then proceeded to deliver both. this was during a mission time frame, but due to the chinese order being an extra 15 min wait, both orders were delivered after the mission time window ended. 
could i have delivered the pizza then came back for the chinese? i wasn’t sure if the app would let me do that. also, if i had said the chinese was late and skipped that order (i believe it gave me the option) would that have hurt my metrics?

"scheduling questions  so i have a question for all of you here. so i qualify for early scheduling and today (12/26) i manually scheduled myself for 3 blocks for this coming up monday (12/30). i did so without realizing i actually have an appointment that day and i can’t work that day so i removed all 3 blocks immediately. 

i’ve never actually done this before so i called gh driver support to see if there would be any repercussions and the lady i spoke to basically made it seem like i royally screwed up. she told me that i may be punished for doing that and that my schedule commitment rating may plummet. i reminded her that on the app itself it says that we have 24hrs to delete an assigned block via availability when we’re given a schedule or 30mins to delete a block we manually gave ourselves from the time we assigned it. keep in mind i dropped the 3 blocks literally 4mins after i manually assigned them to myself which is within the 30min time frame. 

she then proceeds to tell me that those are “the old rules” and that they are no longer valid. if we drop a block any time we are punished. is this true? it says on the app that i should be fine but i don’t want to lose my scheduling ability. any input would be greatly appreciated and have a wonderful and safe new year all! thank you!",2024-12-26 17:18:34,Reddit,GrubHub,1,1,

"is this a glitch with contribution pay starting at midnight of a block that starts before midnight and ends after midnight? i usually do a block from 10:30 p.m. or 11:00 p.m. to 1:00 a.m. in my area. 

a lot of times earlier in the day i have nowhere near 100% acceptance rate which is required in order to get i think you have to have at least 90% in order to get contribution for any block in that day. 

however what i've noticed is if i schedule a block from before midnight that extends to past midnight, when i look at my acceptance rate for the day i have 100%. this makes sense because starting at midnight as long as i accepted anything that i received i would have 100% for that calendar day. 


but now i'm wondering when i get contribution pay for the whole block or just from midnight to 1:00 a.m. in this example? 

knowing grubhub as i do as we all do, i'm pretty sure i'm just going to get contribution pay for from midnight to 1:00 a.m. to fill in what i might not have made even though i made 20 bucks so they're not going to give me anything anyway. however i could be wrong and it might be a glitch or it might be on purpose, i could maybe receive contribution from 10: 30 p.m. to midnight, where i didn't make quite $12 an hour average. 

i'll come back here and edit this comment if i do get contribution for 10:30 to midnight even though my ar was below 80% for the day when i started the block.",2024-12-26 01:52:40,Reddit,GrubHub,0,2,

by the way grubhub was just successfully class actioned to the tune of one hundred and twenty five million for predatory practices in false advertising practices in chicago.

however they got out of it by paying only twenty five million dollars with this legal gymnastic line... we cannot afford to pay the full amount because it would likely bankrupt therefore putting thousands of workers on unemployment... so they said we can't pair and because paying our employees is too expensive and cause too much unemployment.

so the store made covered the order, have it to the driver, that driver being track apparently drove 15-20 minutes to make it to my street, send a blank/black photo as delivery confirmation. but there was an error and the restaurant never got the order???

"when a restaurant tells you that you are required to make the drinks for an order: the official answer is that not only are you not supposed to make the drinks but you're actually supposed to contact support because they consider that a refusal to fulfill the customers order.

backstory: earlier this month i was picking up an order from a poke restaurant while the health inspector was doing their thing. i am familiar with the woman who was inspecting because i she inspected a restaurant i used to work at (we scored perfectly and she was really happy with us).

i ask her if they are passing and they kind of frown and shrug. they didn't pass and require reinspection this week. 

i accept an order today from the same restaurant which prompted me to google their report and see the info i just provided. poultry and fish kind of gross me out so i usually won't get it at a restaurant. so i go back to the counter when the order is ready and they hand me an empty cup for the order but i have no drinks listed. 

i took notice of this whole situation because i had 3 orders in a row that required me to return after leaving to get the bags that they forget to give me. it happens but i should have stopped giving them the benefit of a doubt sooner.

that got me thinking, we should see if there is a connection between businesses making us fulfill drinks and bad scores on health inspections. the reports are public and usually available right after inspection. i also took notice that this restaurant did not have their health inspection report posted anywhere visible inside of the restaurant, that was another red flag.

i know this was a point of contention earlier today in a post, i feel a lot of drinks i'm not trying to make anyone's day worse. but if this is a consistent thing that it may be smart to actually insist that the employees prepare the drinks. i would hate to be responsible for somebody getting sick, i know i would never find out if i did. i also feel like it's only right to let people in your community know if that restaurant is not up to the minimum standard of your local health inspectors office.

driver leaves my food, i come out and it's an ubereats order with a completely wrong name and address.

i called the driver and he struggled to speak english, at one point he just spoke to a translator app and said something along the lines of ""i'm sorry, there's nothing i can do it's what the restaurant gave me""

long story short i gave him $7 for me to have to go and pick my own food up anyway because he took the bag and didn't check or confirm anything. 

what are your opinions? is his job to make sure he actually picked up the right order? is it the restaurants fault for giving him the wrong bag? should he have tried to help at all when i called him?",2024-12-14 11:26:42,Reddit,GrubHub,13,55,

there is a little cesars one mile from my house! i call myself ordering a pizza for the family. and i place an average $3 tip thinking (okay  its not a giant tip. but $3 plus base pay for 2 miles to deliver a pizza to a guy who cant get it himself cuz he has kids should be easy fast money) right????.

but nope come to find out they send the order to the location a good 12 miles from my house…
first off why? pizza will be cold and theres a spot a mile away!?!?
anyways of course i dont realize this until i check wondering whats taking so long. and below and behold the driver is driving in the opposite direction (clearly about to give me the middle finger and swipe my food)

and of course he ends up swiping it so i havw to call and get the tip removed and report him. but i feel horrible because i would havw upped the tip after delivery had i known….

the only way it works is if you put in just the name of the apartment complex... but eventually even that led you to the empty lot. and it was really sad because the customer is really polite and i know her by name by now.

"lying customers does it do any good to call gh after someone receives their order and then lies and said they didn’t? i had this drunk guy put in the wrong address. he texted me saying it wasn’t at his door, and i was still there so i sent him a photo of the order at the address listed, building number and apartment number. he then comes over from wherever they actually live, saying that there are two of the exact same building and apartment numbers. spoiler alert, there is not. i went and looked. 
but i put this guy’s order in his hands. i told him i think he just put in the wrong address, because there’s no way there are two of the exact same address in the same complex. this is a gated apartment complex where i had to use a code. if i had been at the wrong complex, i wouldn’t have even been able to get in. 
i immediately get a notification when i get back in my car, that the order was canceled and not to deliver it. yes, i still got paid. but it just pisses me off that this guy gets to be a dick to me about his mistake and then turn around and get free food. would it do any good to call gh and explain to them what happened? would they penalize him or his account? or is that just a waste of time? and does that not reflect poorly on me, claiming i didn’t deliver it when i definitely did?",2024-12-06 00:21:42,Reddit,GrubHub,3,11,
"grubhub > doordash in atlanta georgia? first impressions i have been a doordash driver in atlanta for quite some time now on the side despite having multiple other jobs to support income , i primarily work on the east side because nobody has any money on the west side or they're just stingy idk but westside is always like 2$ orders so i dont go there. i finally got accepted onto grubhub after like.. a 5-7 month wait and i didnt try it out for a while, but doordash was frustrating me today because of the high traffic volume and the chik-fil-a deliveries where the wait times were like 45 min to pick up (not doing that for your 6$ order), so i decided to head over to my grubhub zone and take some orders there.

 as soon as i started. 17$ order for 6 miles!!! i took it, dropped it off and the new area i had headed too didnt have much traffic at all!! the lady who ordered was super sweet, not even my best doordash customers are that nice here. before i even left her driveway, i got another order!! 15$ for 8 miles, i took it, picked up, then i dropped it off and immediately got another one for 10$, only 3 miles. i ditched doordash entirely today bc the highest offer i ever got was 12$ for 15 miles. i did grubhub for about 5 hours and i made a total of 117$ in the sandy springs-duluth zone.. i like the fact that grubhub allows you to route multiple deliveries everytime a new one pops up which is a pretty frequent thing, the customers were all nicer and it took me mostly to suburbs with easy to locate houses. doordash in my typical zone tends to only take me to apartments, hospitals or the sketchiest addresses in the hood. i struggled to ever make 100$ in an 8 hour shift with doordash, but today i averaged 23$ an hour and there were lots of orders that i did not accept because i was busy doing other things like eating my lunch and stopping at bathrooms lmao. i never got a single order that was under 1$ per mile. my only complaints is the apps ui, its kind of ugly?? harder to navigate than the doordash app, you have to click way too many buttons just to complete each step and i think it, you also dont really get deliveries past 10pm, this is definitely a day time app, doordash might be better at night, but im up early anyways so i dont mind.

 im not sure if this will remain consistent throughout time, but i only spent around 15$ on gas today and didnt get a singular order for under 10$ the entire night, the wait times were even less than doordash which surprised me because everyone has told me grubhub wasnt good for them.. but they're also doing areas like cobb county which on doordash was only paying around 2.50-5$ on orders for high mileage and you just end up declining the majority of them. so far though i very much enjoyed the shift and im looking forward to giving it another go tmrw. grubhub seems to have a lot of gems!!",2024-12-05 23:40:09,Reddit,GrubHub,2,5,

"psa: if a diner says you're allowed to park on the curb in front of a campus building with your hazard lights on and run the food to the front desk... don't! alternate psa: diner instructions are not gospel or the law; if it sounds bullshit, check with people who actually know the law of your area. then have driver care talk to the customer on your behalf.

i talked to campus parking about this for at least my area and they said i can stay in my car and have the customer come and get the food, but you can absolutely not leave your car like that or risk getting a ticket. if you're leaving your car for a campus order that isn't a dorm, need to be in public parking or try to get a visitor permit.

"you should actively promote non-tipping currently it doesn't seem like grubhub is in touch with reality or how to run a business.  a common saying is ""no-tip, no delivery.""  and that's the way it should be, as their delivery + service fee is often $20 and drivers don't see anywhere near enough of that.

  
therefore, you should encourage people to order from their site and tip $0 dollars, every single time.  anytime an order doesn't get delivered, it's grubhub who eats the cost and loses.  if enough people realize that tipping is an absolute scam, then we drivers will either get paid properly for our deliveries, or they'll remove and/or significantly reduce the delivery + service fees to actually allow the customer to properly tip.

  
this strategy is a win for all four parties involved, the customers, the restaurants, the drivers, and grubhub.  granted, it's a big short-term loss for grubhub, but if they hope to stay in this business they'll allow their drivers to make more deliveries, get the money they deserve, and make the useless fees for the customer either useful or go away.

  
if you want to make grubhub a place worth driving for, you'll spread this message as far and wide as possible.  it takes absolutely no thinking to understand how this is best for everyone in the long-run.",2024-12-02 20:14:13,Reddit,GrubHub,0,9,

"why do grubhub drivers take way longer than doordash? so i just ordered from gh, i normally do dd because gh is almost always a bad experience. is there a reason the app says the driver is on the way to me when they're clearly making other deliveries? i always tip well, because i'm tipping in a manor of: ""this person is picking up the order i just placed and bringing it to me"" when in reality, they're picking up several orders and making several deliveries. with mine almost always getting delivered within ~3 mins of the maximum threshold. all ice melted, food essentially cold. this restaurant is 6 minutes away and it took 36 minutes for my food to get here after getting picked up. 

unfortunately i'm just not gonna tip anymore, use gh or have that tip be significantly diminished. 

is this a common issue as i'm sure drivers get most of the blame?

edit: too funny. i hope you clowns don't wonder why people don't tip you losers. i'm not sure what's funnier either, the reddit echo chamber or a bunch of people who's zero skill jobs will be replaced first by robots and ai, in a reddit echo chmaber

do they have a budget of a few thousand dollars to pay someone to have a look at it and make it actually send notifications to drivers?  notifications that drivers can see and hear instead of the invisible, silent, background notifications that it only tells us about after the fact?

"finally happened, block scheduling blocked. so a while back i saw someone mention that they got blocked for not having any orders after being scheduled on a block for 3 hours.

i wasn't sure if this would happen to me, but it did. my account history has not one single order denied, i took everything. everything.

so if you are curious, yes, even someone who accepts every single order can be blocked from scheduling because they went a scheduled time without any orders coming in from grubhub.

grubhub does not care if you have 100% acceptance rate over the career of your time with grubhub. if you go a scheduled block and do not get orders, they will block your ability to schedule blocks.

some people may say i was stupid for taking every order. i was being paid hourly, so i did not reject any orders. for me, this was just a side gig for extra money, and i enjoyed it. that's why i did it. i will not be doing it anymore. i wish you all well, and hope you all are successful with the future of grubhub.

additional information: i was not sitting at home waiting for orders. i was parked at the local mall which has several restaurants around the area that are typically sent all of our orders. the only hotspot we had was a single restaurant about 20 miles over, which usually did not get any orders. there's no guarantee that orders will arrive once you get to a hotspot.

if you are on a scheduled block and you are not getting orders, you might want to reach out to support to let them know you're not getting any orders. this may prevent the automated system from flagging you for 'abusing' the system.

"well, it's official....i got deactivated. no idea why. 

back story: got a message in app on 7/29 asking me to upload my photo id. i did exactly as requested. tried logging in several days later, and got a message stating that my document was under review, but my deadline to submit was 7/31, and the system would not let me log in. probably 15 phone calls, multiple emails to support, and multiple in app service requests later, still no progress. finally around the middle of spetember i sent another email to driver support and this time i copied the ceo in. email was very professionally worded and simply askwd for some sort of update as to why the document review was takimg so long and why nobody could or would tell me what the delay was. still nothing. sent another in october, and copied in the ceo and the vp of driver relations, asking the same questions. still nothing. applied using a different email and phone number, and got put on the waitlist for my area. assumed that the reason my login was inactive was because they had too many drivers, and that when they opened things back up, my login would be reactivated, and that they were using the id verification as a tool to weed out some drivers in the meantime. got a text yesterday saying they were taking new drivers in my area, and i was able to continue the application process. tried my old login....still nothing. started the application under my new email and phone number, and when i got to the page where i entered my dob and ssn, i got a message stating that they would not move forward with my application and thanking me for my interest. 

what a chickenshit way of deactivating drivers. i had zero complaints, a decent ar, and a completion rate well over 90%. no idea why they pulled the plug. don't really miss them, since they were the least busy of the 3 food delivery apps and i also had roadie and shippd and some other non-food delivery apps that i did. i stay busy without them on the nights i run. all i ever wanted was an explanation of what was going on....never got one. 

not surprised that they just sold for a 90% discount...it sounds like the slowdown locally was reflective of a national trend. guess it's better to be rid of them before they inevitably go balls up...if their ceo and vps are as arrogant and non-responsive to everyone else as they are to their delivery partners, they'll drive the thing the rest if the way into the ground soon enough....or the buyer will get rid of them and get people in that are competent.

the transaction is expected to close early next year, at which time grubhub will officially join wonder. until then, we’re as focused as ever on supporting you and achieving our shared goals. stay tuned for more details about this exciting time!

grubhub delivery partner team""

pictures of attention to the two words ""until then,"", meaning they're not going to support us once the takeover is complete. 

you could mean that.

""wonder is a fast-growing, food-tech startup that's raising the bar on the role food plays in peoples' lives. we're a team of food-lovers, entrepreneurs, and some of the most accomplished innovators in the culinary, logistics, and technology industries""

i checked out the wonder carrier app 500 downloads and no reviews yet on the android platform. i suspect that those are all beta testers. i'm assuming that under courier is something for package pickup and delivery and you have to go to some kind of a designated package pickup place in order to accomplish that kind of like puff puff or whatever the hell that was did you get on uber eats sometimes. 

is that what it's called? puff puff? it's been a while. 

so hoping that's not their food delivery system because i don't know what the hell hdr means but i'm imagining it's headquarters driver receiving? 

from looks at the app it's almost like it's got a caviar feel to it.

it also seems like a company that doordash would buy.

anyway was only $500 downloads that's brand new app. 

they're based in new york, so get ready for that nonsense.

when i ordered for myself, i was very puzzled because there is literally a starbucks i could have walked to, but the driver goes two miles away.  there are six starbucks closer.  okay, i didn't go myself, because i was on the fritz, and i didn't feel like i should go out.

we all know what it looks like, that orange banner at the top that has the word view on it and you click the word view, then you see the order. 

first of all, it's a superfluous, unnecessary, ridiculous banner. when we hear the order cowbell and pee open the app, we should just see the owner screen, am i right? 

anyway, when you hear the order cowbell, like pavlov's dog we open the app, and then you don't see the orange banner. what you do? what can you do? 

maybe i'm stupid, but accidentally clicked on the part of the screen or the upper right hand corner which it looks to me like a hand holding a star. 

i clicked on that while hearing the order cowbell, and the order screen came up, the new water screen with the reject button in the upper right hand corner and the sliding timer purple button at the bottom that says accept on it but the countdown timer counting down. 

the dollars offered in the miles total miles it'll take to complete the trip. 

under the several more times after uninstalling and reinstalling the app three times in a row. 

the orange manor sometimes appears and sometimes doesn't, but there's an orange banner the hand with the star icon is covered up, 

if there's no orange banner, just click on the little hand with holding the star, and you will see the order.

the order was delivered well before the estimated time on the app (this place is very fast and nearby, which is why i chose it), and i never got any follow-up message.

fortunately for me, i did not actually see the text message until after the delivery was made because i had my notifications off during a remote meeting, so i never responded or took any action.

is this a common thing for drivers to do? should i report on the app? does the app ui from the driver's perspective make it easy to accidently message the wrong person? i'm wondering if this is an intentional scam or possibly a misdelivered text?

"new courier for grubhub i just started to deliver for gh and it seems like they will send you all over town on deliveries whereas dd has zones that you can stick to. is it like this for new drivers or does it continue no matter how long you've delivered? i stopped doing ue for this reason - they will send you to another state for a delivery and it wasn't worth it. 

another question: should i actually schedule myself or just make myself available? does it hurt my rating or is rating not such a big deal? i'm already on dd and i make sure to keep my rating high. i'm using gh as an experiment because i was told i could earn more on gh. now i'm not so sure.

"open letter to rob delacruz, vp and gen mgr, onsite with grubhub dear mr delacruz,
    my wife has worked for your company for 2 days. in that time, she has racked up several ""violations"" that were not her fault. we live near jacksonville, nc, home to camp lejeune. she cannot get on base with out a cac card, or filling out a visitors day pass and completing a background check every day. furthermore, the base ""addresses"" don't register in maps. ""company b 227 bn"" doesn't reflect a street address, or even a geolocation in order to meet the customer at the gate. 
    we tried calling customer service, and informing them, but they were less than helpful. their suggestion was to simply not take the order if she couldn't deliver it. however, there's no way to see the address until you accept the order. also there is no ""undeliverable to address"" option on the ""problems"" menu. 
    she is a good driver, and loves the job, but is so frustrated she's going to quit. 
     i'm sure she's not the only one. 
     camp lejeune is the largest marine base on the east coast, covering 156,000 acres and over 120,000 personnel.  that's a huge local market share your company is missing out on, due to this problem of base access. ",2024-10-29 13:21:59,Reddit,GrubHub,0,20,

punishment  grub hub must be punishing me for not accepting 2$ orders and not accepting a order where they take 2 hours to finish the food i’m just sitting here made 10$ since 11am it’s now 3 aggggggggh!!!!!!!!!,2024-10-28 15:04:02,Reddit,GrubHub,11,9,
"places you won’t go? last week i was given an order for a restaurant (not a chain) and then on my way there i was given another order for the same place, about $23 in total and not that far for delivery.   i get to the restaurant (i was finishing a different delivery) and i tell the person behind the counter “hi, i’m grubhub here with orders for brad and marc” (not their real names).   the employee then tells me “well, marc is going to be about 24 minutes and brad still has 8 minutes.  so do you want to just cancel one and do the other one first?”   i told them that they’re delivering near each other, which is why grubhub put them together.   the employee then says “other drivers will just cancel one and come back.  if we wait, then one of the orders will be cold and we’ll have to hear from door dash about how the food quality isn’t good”.  and i’m just thinking about how that’s not my problem and they should figure out a better method of operating or not partner with grubhub but unlike this person i am not there to tell them how to do their job.   so i canceled both orders on my end- told grubhub the wait time was too long- and if they give me that place again i won’t go back there.   

the two funny things of this are: i was in a block (i don’t do blocks any more) and ended up at a place where i waited literally 30 minutes for the food but couldn’t just leave because of the block deal but that’s another place i won’t go back and it’s in the same plaza as the restaurant above.  i also went down the road and got thai food which i drove around for like a half an hour because i dropped wings off along the way.  so i mean, even if i don’t take two orders and they’re made so far apart, i still could’ve taken one order from that restaurant, picked up something else and then their order could’ve been just as late (like the thai food). but, again, i’m not here to tell restaurants how to operate and from what i’ve read online people say that the staff at this restaurant are generally rude.  

will gh know not to send me back there?  do they learn?   i’ve been rejecting offers under $5 and i feel like they’re sending them to me less.

the second order i reassigned because i waited over 10 minutes and they said it was going to take another 10 so i unassigned.

"stop working for these people it's not going to get better. the only way to change it is to stop it. all i see here daily are people coping with the bullshit the gig apps do. they'll never get what they deserve because of naive people and humans in general not listening to warnings.

few ideas i've had to disrupt gh/justeats

* a picked up order app - produces false proof so you can steal food from gh
* an app that auto logs you into gh - to prevent deactivation
* auto off/on  - a feature that would turn of and on your delivery status when receiving a bad order, this prevents gh from putting you in timeout for too long
* steal food - you don't even have to work for gh.  i could make another app that generates order info quickly to look like a legit order. it would be just as easy to fool them with an image (this is the reason for the app, so they can press a button and it looks legit) but some have caught on.

thing is i don't have any energy to think about this company anymore. so much so i've been deactivated for inactivity and they won't reactivate me (probably based on past behavior of me not accepting literally everything and blowing my car up). so deuces. if i think of anything else to make gh worse for everyone i'll let you know.",2024-10-26 12:37:40,Reddit,GrubHub,0,0,

"40 min to make $2 i accepted an order to drive 2 miles and make $4. so i though okay that's not far that's fine. first i waited for the order 15 minutes. no big deal, they were busy on a friday night. 

then i drive the 2 miles to the area. doesn't seem too complicated, except for when the map said i was there, only the address could not be found. the street was only like three blocks long, so i went up and down a few times. finally, i get back to the spot the map swears is it and stop and call the customer.  

customer said ""what street are you on, what's around you?"" so i explained what the neighboring houses were like and how the addresses all lined up except hers. as in the addresses were all 141...and hers was apparently 140...but the street ended at a 141.. address. 

then she said ""well i don't see anyone outside my house"" well yeah because i can't find it. that is literally the point. she gave me a vague direction by saying there's a certain car outside the house. and mentioned how a lot of drivers have a hard time finding it.

so i drove around again looking for the car. nothing. at this point it's been about 30 min or so. i call support and they put me on hold to call the customer. who doesn't answer the phone. now if it were me and i knew my delivery driver was lost i'd answer the phone. 

at that point, after two calls, the support person cancelled the order and i got $2. ten minutes later my phone rings and it's the customer calling through support to ask where i am....um at this point i am back home because that whole thing annoyed me. 

i'm sure they are complaining to someone about how i stole their food. the irony is, it was cold and food i wouldn't eat anyway. 

i can always find the house. i've been driving since way before google maps. i know how addresses work. maybe they should write out some actual directions next time. ",2024-10-18 23:59:43,Reddit,GrubHub,13,51,

"am i misunderstanding gh contribution? so on tuesday i worked blocks from 11:00 am until 6:00 pm.  i went available early, i went unavailable a little after 6 and stayed available the entire time.  i stayed within my region and had a 100% acceptance rate.  

at the end of the day, i had made $80 and change in total but the grubhub side of that was only $39.96.   (the rest was in tips). i was under the impression that the grubhub side would then correct itself to being $70, as i’d be getting $10/hr for being in a block.  that means grubhub should’ve given me another $30.04 or am i misunderstanding how this works?

i also must admit that i a) took an order for around $4 which had me driving way too far because the customer didn’t tip (i would have ignored it if i wasn’t in the block going for the 100%) and i also was doing nothing from 3:30-4:30pm because there were simply no orders.  if i wasn’t in a block i would have gone unavailable but i felt tied down to being in the block.  

this whole thing has really soured my idea about blocks because i feel like i didn’t get my guaranteed pay as i understood it to be and i also felt like i’d be getting more orders when i also sat from 12-12:30 and had none. 

while i realize not every day can be the same, in contrast the prior tuesday i went out from noon until 6- a whole hour less- and made around $100 and i wasn’t in a block. i also went unavailable for about an hour or so during that time to go to goodwill.   

i see a lot of discussion with people on both sides of the fence about blocks and based on my one day using them i don’t think they’re worth being tied down.  the best part of this job is that you can just go unavailable if the day sucks or you get diarrhea or something.  but when you’re in a block, that can’t happen.  so, for me, even if grubhub gave me that $30, i’d only had made $10 more than last tuesday when i wasn’t available for as long and wasn’t in blocks.   

but am i understanding blocks correctly in the way that they are based on the grubhub pay and don’t include tips or is it that i made $80 on the day with tips and that’s more than $70 so grubhub kicks in nothing? ",2024-10-17 10:24:19,Reddit,GrubHub,5,20,

"thinking about driving part time i'm not sure exactly why, but reddit started showing me posts from food delivery app groups. it got me thinking...

long story short, i just took a new wfh role at my current employer that is salary and partially tied up in quarterly bonuses, and even though it should be roughly the same as my old hourly position at the end of the year, the day to day pay is lower. 

so i'm considering doing some food delivery a few nights a week to pad the ol' checking account. at least until i can catch up with with a couple or few bonuses. 

is it worth doing this as a part time, probably short term gig with the understanding that i don't need to make a living at it? i live on the edge of a city with a large-ish population and plenty of participating restaurants. i have a new vehicle that gets 23-25 mpg. gas prices are around $2.75/gal. 

my previous job involved driving to places around the state, frequently following vague and sometimes impossible instructions with incorrect or incomplete contact info. so none of that worries me.

"i think i figured out why my id documents have taken 8 weeks and counting to get reapproved. last week of july, got a message in the app (while i was on a delivery!) asking me to submit photos of the front and back of my id. thought that was weird, since my license was nowhere near expiring, but sent them anyway. tried logging in 4 or 5 days later, and got a message that my documents were under review and it should be a couple.of days but the due date was 7/31. i couldn't get past that screen. called support, got scripted, can't connect to that group, we'll start a ticket, can't elevate to a manager, just have to wait. countless phone calls, emails (even including the ceo and chief experience officer!), and online help requests later, we're at 8 weeks and counting of no progress (or even an acknowledgement that the issue exists). 

so today i decided to try to create a new account. lo and behold, drivers are waitlisted in my area! 

looks like the id thing was just a way to cull the herd of existing drivers....i had noticed that the number and quality of gh orders had dropped off dramatically before all this happened (i normally have  gh, ue and dd all going at once, plus roadie and shipt), and gh might have sent me 2-4 orders over the course of a 5pm-10pm shift (off block). i'm guessing they approved way too many people at the same time their market share locally started dropping. good thing the other 2 apps seem to be doing well.....i really haven't seen any appreciable revenue impact from getting relegated, but it would be nice to still have that arrow in my quiver.

"bs violation for “not delivering orders”. hey everyone! my friend made a reddit account to post here but couldn’t because she’s new lol and asked me to do a post for her. soo, here it is! 
tldr; being flagged for not delivering orders but not true. 

“i'm new to grubhub. my very first delivery last thursday, the lady gave me the wrong address to the hotel she was staying at. i delivered it to the wrong hotel and then got a text from her saying it wasn't delivered properly. i apologized and went back for it and told her i was on my way to drop it off at the correct hotel. she was completely understanding and apologized for giving me the wrong info. 5-10 minutes after she acknowledged my message that i was on my way, i got a notification that she cancelled the order and to not deliver the item. y'all know how it prompts you to not deliver if an order is cancelled. so i kept it and then continued to my next pick up.

yesterday, i had a lady place two separate orders at the same restaurant. i thought maybe it was an accident because it was the same exact item. i picked them both up and delivered. at first, i delivered to the wrong building in her community. when i submitted the photos, she called me immediately and directed me where to go. she met me outside and i hand delivered the order to her, but i was unable to submit a photo because i had already done so. about 10 minutes later i got a notification that both those orders were cancelled.

i'm assuming this is the reason i have a violation but can anyone explain to me why?  the app quite literally won’t allow you to deliver if you are at the wrong address based on the gps so it’s complete bullshit. i called customer service and of course they were no help. i was told the violation will fall off after 90 days. but i don't want this to be a reoccurring issue and possibly get more false violations and then my account gets deactivated. anyone experience this as well? any suggestions on what to do to prevent this from happening again?”",2024-09-24 13:59:17,Reddit,GrubHub,1,7,

"why grubhub is so unprofessional ( or are they ) ? - no wonder they can't pay the drivers appropriately after losing money everyday... did 4 orders yesterday. was multi-apping with shipt.

i could mark arrived for 3 of them. surprisingly the mall ( pretzels ) order ( $11+ for 7 miles ) did not allow me to do so??? - tried moving around the restaurant in the mall but no avail.

restaurant did not have the order. she took my phone & completed the order.

kept on getting crappy ' you are almost there - blah blah blah'

so after picking up - called gh - she apologized in broken english...

and while i was talking to her and about to start driving to the customer, gh unassigned me because i didn't move to the restaurant???

ended up with a ton of auntie ann's pretzels which i am not a fan of... and no pay for all the efforts - like parking far away due to unavailabity, walking back & forth to the car, waiting because restaurant didn't have the order & finally interacting with gh support.

also arrival/completion ratings got trashed ( i don't care anyways being a partner - lol ) - but if it happens frequently then violations or even decativation could come into play...

on the other hand - gh lost money because they trust customers 100% - no matter what - so instant refund... gh doesn't investigate food not received claims as well - just refund because its drivers' fault 100%  - they are bad people and can never be trusted... 

they have to be penalized day in & day out - no matter what ...

they lose ton of money on their unprofessionalism everyday  - so what is the solution to recover lost money ? -  cut the driver pay...

to be fair to gh - i made big money in the past with gh and still love gh ( not as much though ) and i sincerely hope i am wrong...

"out of retirement posting to say, ""worse fear happened"" dog attacked me.  currently things are still in the process of being handled. even grubhub is currently investigating the incident. 

what happened:
i was delivering a customers order which was a cherry slurpee and a box of pocky. i get to their house and notice there dog was very aggressive. i'm talking pushing the vinyl gate outwards. i see this and proceed to text the customer the macro, i've arrived. the gate opens up and i'm standing there with the order thinking ""maybe the dog is put away."" dead wrong. flying out of the gate is a large german shepherd. proceeds to go after me gets my hand, elbow, side and lastly my leg. i fall to the ground. as the dog barely gets to my leg. a teenager who lives there pulled the dog off and took them inside. apologized for it and i got off lucky. 

the dog barely did any significant damage my hand hurts a little bit. so did my side and left shoulder from the fall. currently, i have reported it to the local animal control, i'm awaiting a incident report number to file a police report. i did let grubhub know and i'm not doing any more deliveries to that house. i'm also awaiting to hear back from them as far as their investigation. they sent an email asking for all the information. including the medication i received in the urgent care. i do plan to go as far as possible with this. i know it's an accident and apparently as the customer said ""my brother is in a wheel chair and opened the gate."" i don't know how true that is. figured i'd post this for the sake that it might be helpful. 

especially since i was on grubhub's time and they have accident insurance. i'm curious how this is going to go. i told my mom i'm going to be pissed. if they send me a $100 gift card. if that. i'm sure i'm getting a ""oh we're sorry for the inconvenience that happened to you."" 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤬🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬",2024-09-21 16:15:25,Reddit,GrubHub,4,19,

after i'm done with my shifts today i'm going to uninstall the app and reinstall and hopefully that fixes it, cause i don't even dare try to to view order and wait because the old timer was awful (felt like 2-5 seconds, if that), and then you ""miss"" the order, so it's not worth risking but yesterday i didn't have to do anything, the big green accept ui and timer would show me everything i needed to know, and now that's gone, reverted back to the old one. i'm concerned because a) it sucks to be on the old one), and b ) i'm not seeing anyone else mentioning this problem. not a single post. that's not good lol. so my question is guys, anyone getting the old offer screen (orange popup with no timer on it) today? as in, not seeing the new ui screen that had the big green acceptance button, a 50 second timer, and a little red reject button?",2024-09-18 15:28:08,Reddit,GrubHub,3,17,
"gh vs dd opinions?  been doing gh for about a month now and just started dd today. i'm curious what everyone's opinions are on the differences. 

gh i like because i can throw it on whenever i want to earn a few bucks. so far with dd it seems to be on a per need basis. i can't just start it and go. it either needs to be busy or i have to schedule. it also stopped me when the area i was delivering in was no longer busy. i do have more choices with dd as far as area though if i want to travel around my state.

so far with dd i haven't received any double orders or got any orders when i'm in the middle of a delivery, which means i'm sitting around waiting more or chasing hot spots. but i haven't received any lowball orders yet like i seem to get a lot of with gh. everything has been over $1/mile.

the interface for gh seems a lot quicker on my phone. loading everything up is almost instant where dd takes 5-10 seconds to load up. i do like that the navigation is built right into the app instead of bouncing between the two with gh. 

so i'm curious what everyone's opinions are. do you find it worth it to go between the two or do you stick with one or the other? do you find one tends to pay better? also, for those with experience using dd, am i better getting paid by the order or by time?

after i didn't get paid, i called them again. while speaking with the rep, i noticed that my bank account number was changed that day i got that complaint. so grubhub is escalating the information, but this is nuts. not sure if it was a mistake or a rogue grubhub employee. but this whole thing is insane.

"got a double order where order a was ready and the manager asked me to go deliver it and come back for b because sushi. asked driver care to mark order a delivered and she marks order b delivered instead and then tried to turn around and say it was my fault. got two orders simultaneously for a local sushi place. molina and sabrina. molina ordered just two raw fish rolls ready and already waiting for pickup, while sabrina's was a big dinner and would take 25 minutes.

the manager walks out and asks me nicely if i can go please deliver melina's order first since she's a 3-minute drive away and back and because it's raw fish. so i get to melina's house and i find the new format of the app doesn't let me prematurely mark one order as delivered or even take a picture...

so i get on the phone with driver care with of course the thickest hindi accent person i've encountered on this job yet... while driving back to the sushi place i explained to her that i already delivered to \*​molina\* and that i'm going back to wait for sabrina's order. i repeated about three times that it was molina that was done. dc lady kept being confused and asking if i wanted to unassign an order, or the diner or the restaurant wanted to cancel, or that i couldn't complete sabrina's order. all while both chickens and a baby crying loudly were in the background on her end. 

by the time i was in the parking lot she said she finally got it and that she would mark the order as delivered... she marked​ sabrina's order instead after i told her four times emphasizing ""molina is delivered!""...

i tell her she marked the wrong orders delivered and i was going to deliver that order and that i told her multiple times that it was the other order... she's deathly quiet aside from her baby and chickens for a long time... then asks if i was trying to prematurely mark an order de​livered without completing it. i just replied back that i know these calls are being recorded and that i told her that she marked the wrong order as delivered... and she just hangs up.f

i finally have to call driver care immediately again while i'm being sent to another order to a kfc and burger king. this time it's a hindi accented guy who knows his stuff and it's just as flabbergasted as i am and says that he has my previous driver care collar on record and will make a complaint and that he also canceled sabrina's order so it doesn't look like i stole it... still got the full amount + the $13 sabrina was going to tip me anyway... oops",2024-09-13 09:38:43,Reddit,GrubHub,0,11,

i need to monitor it the next order i get, but it feels like it goes down anyway unless the food is magically already ready and you leave before the arrival time is up.

i initially thought this meant 20 deliveries in total. this is very difficult to achieve, as in my market they rarely send me any deliveries, and the ones they do send are often poor. the most i’ve managed is 6 deliveries in a weekend, and even then, i was pushing myself to reach a total of 20, since most of the deliveries were terrible.

this expectation from grubhub is so unrealistic, especially given the low volume of orders they offer.

i can't even get this done, because even if i take all the bad orders i'm not even sure they will send me enough to get 20 done in 14 days.

it should be 20 deliveries in total, not within 14 days.

edit: i am willing to accept all tips from other drivers to improve this issue.

i've cleared the cache and data on the app now to avoid the order flood issue hopefully and i'm scheduling even more blocks ahead of time to try scheduling again.",2024-09-10 12:12:22,Reddit,GrubHub,4,11,

been doing dd and ue for almost a year now, finally got off the waitlist for gh and did my fist shift today. already think it's worse than the other two. rejected 39 out of 41, most of which were high miles going out of my area. dd is where i make most of my money and ue is just a filler for when dd is slow. i guess gh will also just be a filler. the things i already dislike about gh:

  
1. can't pause the app. just seen in the app that when you're on a scheduled block you can only take one 10 minute break every 2 hours. hell no, i am an independent contractor, not an employee, you ain't telling me when i can and can't take a break.

  
2. stacked orders. i see gh has gone the way dd. 90% of the offers they sent me were stacked and some of the pick-ups and/or drop-offs weren't even close to each other. at least dd and ue keeps them pretty close together.

  
3. getting offers while driving to a drop-off. gh opens the map app when navigating and i missed a bunch of offers because i couldn't navigate back to the gh app to view them. i ain't trying to do all that while i'm driving.

  
4. offers going out of my zone. i live in a big college city. on dd and ue if i get a good paying order to one of the smaller towns outside the city i can usually catch an order from one of the mom and pop restaurants going back to the city. with gh i would have to drive back to my zone before receiving any more offers, meaning a lot of dead drive back. it would have to be really high paying for me to that.

  
if anyone has any tips on how to utilize these dislikes better, or any others tips regarding gh, id be happy to here them and thanks for reading my long ass rant.",2024-09-06 20:31:42,Reddit,GrubHub,6,29,

"how i found out if a place intentionally delays gig orders or place them on the back burner by ordering the exact same things in line and getting it ready before the dispatched gh or other gig order comes out. and this applies if you let them know about your gig order first before placing your order. i remember arriving exactly at eta yes i was dispatched early. i remember a fast food type place say they are busy and it will be ready in 8 minutes. but when i place the exact same order i get it in around 2 minutes what’s up with that?

but at least gh didn’t auto unassign when i decided to wait until my arrival is around eta otherwise i would had been be really angry. anyone done this before? i am thinking it’s not impossible for one to have table service for the same food and finish it and pay the check before the gh order comes out of the kitchen.

"grubhub online time after getting blocks reinstated? it’s interesting i noticed that after gh reinstated my blocks after years of hiatus, i noticed something interesting, my market is pretty dead anyways though most of orders i get seem to be late night or early morning otherwise i pretty much get nothing. so i log on at night around 9 and schedule 11-1am as well as 5:00-7:00 or 8:00 am and i did log off to sleep between 1 - 5am however i still get kicked off at ten even though i had 4 hours off two are closed hours anyways between 9 pm and ten am.  thus only 8 online hour in total keep in mind zero time actually worked and i didn’t schedule blocks at night. it appears with blocks they count all the hours starting from going online doesn’t matter one logged off or the market closed in between for two hours.

i am thinking they programmed the policy this way to punish cherry pickers. it appears only uber actually interpret to the full letter of drive time not idle time. 

gh seem to count online time to the ten hour cap doesn’t matter whether one receives any jobs let alone accepted and worked the job. so when orders finally comes one gets cut off by log in hours limit. alas gh is the only one that is getting orders at all dd almost nothing these days.

"getting it out of my chest  i worked at driver care and driver payment for grubhub a couple of years ago, and i have always wanted to make a post about this. 

firstly, i want to point out something obvious but still needed; as this was a couple years ago,, i am not 100% sure if things are still the same, but knowing corporate, they probably are. 

now, i am not sure on how to start this, but basically, and without the intend of being harsh, you guys should value yourself more and fight for better work conditions. 

i consider myself someone really empathic, and to be honest it was complicated having to deal with a job where you are suposed to support, but you are really not helping at all even if you want to. most helpful stuff you could do was getting the restaurant to remake an order lmao. driver care is there 50% of the times to deal with driver's complains. 

the majority, if not all, of the of the processes that are followed by customer and driver support are driven towards retaining the customer at all costs. it is stupidly insane the amount of money that these guys are willing to spend just to retain the customer when they have a ""bad"" experience. 

for example, if a customer got their order cancelled, they would get a $10-$20 coupon, while you guys literally did not even got paid for going to the restaurant or driving crazy amounts of time. like, i am not saying customers should not be compensated when that stuff happen, but they can easily do a $5-$10 each, but they just don't.  

when i was at driver payment, 95% of my work was denying payments for canceled orders, mileage adjustments, etc. we almost never did any adjustment, and if we did it was $1 tops. my advise is, don't event lose your time and energy with trying to get a pay adjustment for an order lol 

also, corporate and the higher ups have really no idea of what the actual fuck is going on or what are you guys experiencing there in the field. i remember being called for meetings to kind of keep them posted and it was hard for them to understand some stuff because they were clearly not interested in knowing what is really going on.

summing up, don't forget that you guys are who is keeping the company running, not the customers, nor the clowns in suits that are there just scratching their asses. you guys are doing the deliveres, you are dealing with the traffic, customers, annoying restaurant employees, etc. they are nothing without you, and if you guys trully organize, you could fuck them up or at least get better conditions. 

i know changing the way thing works is hard, but in the meantime, do not get crazy about your rates and just take whatever orders you feel like and that will make your day easier while redituable. most of the times you won't get paid more if you do what they want you to, and the benefits are minimal.

something else that i would like to add is that,, i know most of you all are tired and having a tough day when you pick up the phone and call driver care, but don't forget that the guy or girl on the phone is algo a human trying to do their job, and probably while having a shitty day too, so be kind. 

finally, i just want to thank you all for everything. of course that i don't know anyone in the sub, and no one will recognize me, but i am sure that i must have worked with at least one of you guys, and i hope i made your day easier back then, even if you do not know or remember me.

"what’s the purpose of scheduling blocks these days, and how gh calculates ca prop 22 time limits. interesting as it appears nowadays they don’t compensate for complete lack of orders anymore during a block period as unlike in the past it’s not possible to take advantage of blocks pay doing low demand times when gh might not send  any orders. i remember any order not taken would wipe out any chance of gh compensation anyways.

i be curious what is the purpose of having blocks these days anyways especially in markets with minimum pay for active time anyways. does it give order priority? as it’s very slow these days as people are fed up with high fees for worse quality service.

i remember back in 2019 on a slow night they send me a low paying order 20 miles one way away which i turned down that night close to end of shift they took away all ghc for that day. that was back when they paid ghc if all orders were taken which including if gh didn’t send an order throughout the block. 

also, unlike uber, which only 
calculates active hours and or moving more than 10 miles per hour while looking for ride requests or orders as the prop 22 language does say “logged in and driving” i noticed gh tends to calculate anytime logged in as well as scheduled on blocks regardless one actually worked or driven at all either logged on or on block. it appears there strategy to interpret prop 22 this way is to get cherry pickers off line. nowadays blocks are only available late night or early mornings anyways.

when you get offers for a business and it says leave at door and no special instructions.  do you actually leave it at the door  i mean it’s mostly the front desk people and sure they dont want you to leave it at the door when it’s open for business but wondering if you all take the notes literally 😂,2024-08-31 18:20:58,Reddit,GrubHub,11,29,
"do you have ""serial no tippers"" that you recognized by name and try to refuse orders from, but they just keep ordering? mine here in an american southwest city are...

maher... lives in the swanky part of town with two garages in a gated community. keeps ordering huge catering family sized meals from grubhub. the last order i took from him (i was naive and this was my first no tipper)​ his kid picked up the bag and happily waved to me, but the dude yanks him by the arm into the house and gives me a death glare from the doorway...

another is pratyak who lives in an apartment complex or his building is in the middle where no parking lot is nearby and he's on the third floor. he always perks from his cracked door and waits for you to descend the stairs before grabbing his food and he was way more obvious to put on my blacklist because he'd always order far away dinky fast food with no tip.

one more is larry... he tries ordering food with precise amounts of random sauces that are always way too much for the meal he orders. he apparently lives in a motel 6, because the first time i thought he was just a cheap ass tourist but i keep getting offers for him every year.

the weirdly most egregious one is steven because the first two times i did his order he lives in a duplex and looks just like harry knowles and he comes out to get his food and acts all polite but him and his premises always reeks of marijuana and he is always visibly high. he tried an order every single day for three weeks.",2024-08-31 01:06:56,Reddit,GrubHub,14,54,

"what’s the deal with grubhub’s owya and its history? if appears nowadays it’s only for shop and pay orders

fortunately unpartnered restaurants are out due to the mormetarium on violating unpartnered restaurants menu copyrights.

they joined the owya card fad right before lockdown abruptly. 

it appears for postmates and doordash originally when they started they had the card as standard payment procedure as automated tablet payment haven’t been rolled out yet across all their partners yet so it was a bandage solution. though eventually they find it an idea to get to deliver non participating restaurant orders. 
it appears gh started later and only after partnering with restaurants long before they had deliveries thus they didn’t have card initially. 

i still remember one restaurant getting mad at me for calling in a owya order instead of ordering at counter, that place had a super long line at that time just because they saw the card . i immediately cancelled after they became aggressive towards me. yet they stilled called me every 15 minutes to try remind me to pickup and pay but i had to insist it’s not my order, i eventually had to block their number. anyone have stories on this?",2024-08-29 21:42:18,Reddit,GrubHub,2,3,
"guaranteed pay is a scam!  i've been driving for gh for almost 4 years now in hickory, nc which isn't a huge city like charlotte, but it's a pretty decent sized area and i used to average around $120 (i know that's not a lot in larger markets but around here it's pretty good) in an 6-hour shift. i've only a couple of times had to take the guarantee pay. today i was on a scheduled block from 7am-12pm and by 11 i'd had one total order for $13.76 which itself is strange because thursdays are usually extremely busy. another order showed up for a new restaurant i'd never heard of which i accepted, hit navigate, and headed to the location. when i got there i switched back to the app and the order was gone. i looked in my order history to see if it was cancelled and it now showed it as a missed order. i called driver care, the agent i spoke to said that he could see that i had accepted it but that it had been reassigned for some reason almost immediately after i accepted and said it must have been a glitch in the system and that he'd get it fixed so that the missed order would be taken off of my history. fast forward to this evening i go check my history because i'm still getting no orders even though i'm available and sitting in a large hot zone (yes i know they're bs) and the order has been put back on my history and my acceptance for the day is now at 50%. i called driver care back and the agent i spoke with said that she couldn't fix it. i asked to speak to her supervisor because i could hear them in the background coaching her on what to say, to which she blatantly lied and said the supervisors are in a meeting for 2 hours and to call back then. this stuff is getting out of hand. how are we supposed to be out here making money but they can't bother to give us the orders? i went to three of my regular restaurants just now and they said they've got all kinds of grubhub orders in and nobody coming to pick them up. how are we supposed to go pick them up if we're not getting the orders make this make sense to me.

"have you ever had any stories of really nasty or just bad driver care calls? like where the person was being weirdly unprofessional or straight up lying to you or just acting like a robot and reciting every canned response with no original thought? did a cvs grocery order delivery for $19, but the store had all the pills in weird places with different prices. i called driver care because none of the barcodes worked for the item the guy wanted or his substitutes. but at every single moment, this power tripping asshole went into a blatantly canned phrase of ""so are you saying that you are unable to complete this order, because that gives me grounds to unassign this order with a penalty!"" in a very accusatory and oddly monotone voice like he was a cop pulling me over and reading options for my ticket or my miranda rights.

like it sounded like he does this at every call possible so he can hang up as fast as possible, because the first time he did that he went straight for it in the middle of my explanation of what was wrong.

i just kept trying to keep defusing him from doing that about three times in a row while he had absolutely no idea how the shopping menu even worked; like he didn't know there could be substitutions or that i was scanning barcodes. all i needed him to basically do was ​finagle the menu back because i found the original item and it wouldn't let me go back and say i did. ""so are you saying that you have messed up the app by your own fault? because if you have, i have grounds to unassign this order with penalty!?""

i finally got mad and told him not to do anything, i'll just press ""submit item anyway"" then he cut me off asking ""so you are saying you're committing fraud by attempting to purchase the wrong item with your driver card!?""

"grubhub sending orders far away from customers without them realizing it there is a restaurant  i always order from just a mile from my house. i assume that’s where i was ordering since previous orders came from there. today i placed my lunch order and it showed on the map my order coming from a location in a different city which i know is about a half an hour away in traffic. i feel bad because my tip is based on the mile-away location, and i also don’t want to eat cold food. the grub hub won’t cancel despite my immediately trying to cancel when i noticed this.  i just wanted to point out that when drivers see orders that don't make sense, it could be that the customers don't even realize where grubhub is routing their orders.  i thought i was being nice for leaving a $8 tip on a $16 order from 1 mile from my house, and now it's an 8 dollar tip to deliver from a different city in rush hour traffic which could be a half hour of driving one way and i'm getting screwed because gh won't cancel it.   multiple drivers accepted the order and later canceled it despite waiting some time.  the delivery estimate is 1.5 hours from when i placed the order.

"my $20 cash tip guy let me down… i’ve spoken about this customer before - he’s prepared to cash tip $5, $10, or $20 cash, completely dependent upon the level of service 

did you get lost, is your attitude good, food handling, etc

i’ve always gotten the $20

i got a run to his place, saturday night, and gh decides to jam a second offer in front of him

i assumed he’d be okay, texted him to let him know… no usual “hey great, thanks” or whatever 

when i dropped off his food, he met me out front as usual, but with very little interaction took his food and walked away 

no tip

at all 

i think i might have actually stood there blinking for a long time 

there was a clear message here

“when i order first, i want to be first”

and he’s entitled to that

was he wrong to punish me, this way? not completely  

he has every right in the world to use his money to influence the service he’s provided 

and i had a choice - accept or decline the second offer - plain and simple 

how will i do it in the future? 

i’ll have to decide which pieces of this puzzle have what “value”

starting with my stats, are they worth twenty bucks? for me, no

is this customer’s satisfaction, and twenty bucks, worth more than my stats? not sure…

is this customer’s satisfaction and twenty bucks, worth more than my stats and the other $12 offer? no, hard no!

his twenty dollars worth of bargaining power just dwindled to $8…

i have to work way harder than $8, and way more than $20, too… to repair the damage from a single rejection 

sometimes i don’t get a tip

"wondering legitimacy so i’ve been driving for grubhub for almost 7 months and never really had an issue recently. this restaurant had an attitude with me because i did not wait for the food when they wouldn’t even tell me how long the wait. time was the next time i went into the restaurant. they decided to get short and say i’m not giving you the order my friend then after he does that he refused. 

to give it to me so i called the customer letting them know so they can understand what the delay is, and i tried calling grubhub with no result. i don’t understand how these restaurants can do that to withholding the order from them. if they did not want me back at the establishment, they should’ve told grubhub not to send me here. they have that ability on their tablet or even on the computer logging into their merchant account. 

but to the point, i’m still on hold after the weekend so saturday was the original report got put on hold for false complaint that was not true saying i was harassing and refusing to leave the restaurant  it was a hot day that day so they weren’t giving me the order. i stood my own little corner. at least to be in the ac when doing the calls i had to do. all this is on body cam showing that i did nothing wrong. i do have a body cam that proves if there’s any false accusations that arise. 

i showed them the information and they gave me my account back in less than eight hours but the main problem they decided the next day to put my account on hold again and since then when they did it on sunday, putting it on hold again they claim have a photo well as written evidence against me as opposed to the first support, same date and all

but again clearly, my body cam footage shows that i’ve been professional trying to find out a solution to a problem and now i have no way to reach anybody and when i call on the phone, they say they don’t handle it and it’s a specialized team. anybody knows what i can do to get that pushed along to get my account back because clearly i have evidence i did nothing wrong on the date. mentioned",2024-08-21 13:08:22,Reddit,GrubHub,0,2,

"does my driver get penalized if i report missing items? 

hey drivers! i've never had anything but excellent grubhub drivers—effecient, on time, friendly & follow instructions for delivery. i try to tip accordingly, minimum 
25%, or higher if it's weird hours, includes awkward drinks, soup, frozen items etc.

that said, recently i've received a series of deliveries that were missing items or included an item significantly wrong from what i ordered. 

all of my deliveries were ""safety sealed"" and would have been by no fault of the driver.

will i negatively impact the driver if i submit an order for partial refund for the incorrect/missing items? i hesitate to submit these requests in case they affect the driver, because i know it's not the driver's fault. they'd have no way of looking inside closed/sealed orders to check if an item is correct or missing. 

i don't like paying for items i didn't receive or didn't order, but even more, i hate the idea of the already-underpaid driver being penalized for something they can't control.

this is not the norm. 90% of the time my order is correct and gets here with zero issues—but the last three orders i placed at different restaurants were either missing an item completely or significantly different from the order i placed (e.g. ordered biscuits and gravy but received no gravy).

does my refund or partial refund affect the driver's pay/tip/rating?

"schedule commitment rating - how does it work...? i've been chatting with support about this to no avail.  i'm hoping one of you has better insights.

i'm a recently reactivated driver.  i managed to get a few blocks scheduled. (apparently its quite the feeding frenzy when they become available) 

one day before my first block, i thought i would accept orders only to find i was arbitrarily deactivated pending my 4th id verification.  

when my first scheduled block rolled around a day later, my identity verification was still pending, so i was still unable to accept orders.  to be clear, i was ready and able to drive, but the app wouldn't allow me to take orders.  i even tried going active just to see if i could and the app stopped me cold.

yesterday i was finally able to take orders and drove for a few hours through dinner service.  

this morning i checked my stats, and my schedule commitment rating is at 54%  i presume this is because i missed a scheduled block, because my id needed to be verified.  

now i have little to no access to scheduling, so how am i supposed to improve my commitment rating?

i'm trying to make a common sense appeal that the missed block should not have counted against my commitment because i had already been through identity verification 3 times prior and this was unnecessary.  it had been a few years since i drove for gh and i don't remember it being this complicated.",2024-08-18 14:55:31,Reddit,GrubHub,2,6,

select ""delivery partners request form"" then scroll down the page to select a topic and choose ""i have delivered a grubhub order"" then ""scheduling"" then ""i received an email with scheduling restricted in the subject line"". when they email you back with their automated bs then reply to that email and ask them to either explain what you did wrong or reactivate you. don't be jerky about it either, i assume that might help.

that's what got them back for me. i also  just helped someone on this sub that had been trying to get them back for a while that hadn't tried this method. once they did this they got them back within a day or two. for me it took about a week, but they messaged me the next day saying they were reviewing my account. let me know if anyone gets them back!",2024-08-16 13:16:47,Reddit,GrubHub,7,8,

"question about refunds as a consumer delivery drivers of all kinds regularly screw up my delivery address.  i live on a busy street so i imagine they just go to the street behind my house because it's easier to park / their gps may even take them there.  but while my dwelling is attached to the building on that street, it is a completely different apartment on a different street with a different address and i don't have a key into their lobby.  my door has a completely different house number than the door(s) i've found my orders at.  my delivery instructions explicitly state 

> ""red door with number ""###"" on it - if the door does not have ""###"" then it is the not the correct address.""

however i'd wager that about 1 in 4 orders is delivered wrong.  i always get a refund when this happens regardless of whether or not i am ultimately able to find my food (which i often am, but definitely not always) - because i do not pay for grubhub+, delivery fees, and tip to have to walk around looking for the food i ordered.  i pay for those things to have the food delivered directly to the address on my order.  i don't want to screw over people so i'm wondering if i should just delete grubhub altogether.

i'm wondering though - how does this impact drivers?  grubhub pretty much always refunds me no matter what - do the drivers lose their tip or anything?  does the restaurant eat the cost?",2024-08-14 14:23:22,Reddit,GrubHub,1,6,

"the on time % i admit to only doing about six or seven grubhub orders each month now, but that on time percent is 100% rigged. there's no if and's or doubts about it.

you absolutely cant keep it at 100% if you live in a city where there's more than three people at a traffic light. if you live in the suburbs without a lot of traffic, maybe it's possible? 

nobody in houston has a 100% on time. i had like an 85% on time and accepted an order the other day. i was already at this restaurant. i'm not talking about driving past it or being on the other side of the parking lot, i was  literally standing directly inside the fucking restaurant. i was picking up an uber order. 

i had this food in under 30 seconds. i dropped this off 1.5 miles away and my completion percentage immediately went down .

i think what they're doing is keeping the clock running on another driver that dropped it.. maybe another just dropped it within 5 minutes of me picking it up but the clock was still running? 

whatever is going on, you absolutely cannot maintain a 100% on time. they're hooking you up if you do have 100%.

"how to get notification of delivery when i order from grub hub i turn off contactless delivery and put in the delivery instructions for the driver to knock on the door and that my doorbell is broken. my hope is that at the very least, i will be alerted to the food being dropped off at my house if not having it actually handed to me.

however, i would say, in the last 6 times i've ordered 4 or 5 times the food has been left on the doorstep and the driver has just left resulting in the food sitting anywhere from 15 min to an hour and me getting cold food. yes, i am partially to blame as i should be more vigilant, but sometimes i get wrapped up in doing something and lose track of time.

is it asking too much to have the driver knock on my front door, give me a phone call, or simply send me a text notifying me the food has arrived? as a former food delivery driver myself, i always tip north of 20%, but now i'm rethinking it to not tipping or setting up a cash tip to require interaction for the driver to receive their tip. curious as to what grub hub drivers thoughts are. and yes, i've sent complaints to grub hub but i'm not sure they address customer issues and hold their drivers accountable.",2024-08-06 12:08:17,Reddit,GrubHub,1,18,

by the time i drove to pick up the order and had to wait...they sent two more orders because i did not accept the first because my block was ending  literally three minutes later. 

why tf. are yall sending orders that require an additional 40 minutes to deliver when my block is ending three minutes later. 

that is 9 dollars a f in hour... basically.

"today is the day i will stop tipping on all delivery services as the delivery and service fees should cover your end. i'm done paying $10-15 in extra delivery and service fees and still be expected to pony up another $5-15 for the delivery. i just paid it, it's literally in the receipt. i'm not paying 30% or more in fees for the service, that defeats the purpose. if you as the driver don't like the structure, get another job or complain to your management about the fee structure. i as a customer am done paying these stupid costs. i paid enough for the food and extra fees. you figure this out on your end. as a lifetime, (i'm old) 15-20% tipper, it ends tonight. don't like it? get another job. that's how the world works.

**update aug6** i know you guys won't believe me, but this is truth. so after this post i placed my first grubhub order, and realized my home address was incorrect as the driver was enroute. had to reach out and get it fixed and felt bad for providing driver wrong info. so... a tip at this stage was very much warranted for my stupidity, but the only bills i had were a few $20s. staring at those $20s all i heard was all you drivers kvetching and bitching and moaning swirling in my head. so i handed the driver a $20 and said it's your lucky tip day! as it was a 50% tip. 

she barely batted an eye, and acted as if i handed her a penny, not even an ow wow, just a weak ass barely audible thanks, grabbed it and walked away.

"ok, apparently my last post was extremely controversial, so i’m making this to clear things up because i can’t edit my post. i’ll start by reiterating what happened yesterday, with as much detail as possible.

i ordered food from grubhub. i’m the customer, not the driver. i got a couple meals for myself and my mom, and paid a 20% tip on top of the total (which already “includes the tip”, but grubhub pays their drivers shit so i feel like that doesn’t count). i do this routinely with uber eats as well, which is what i normally order food on. this restaurant only had a grubhub page.  
  
i live in an apartment complex. what makes it annoying to find my exact apartment are the very small signs, but it’s not bad to drive on and i always leave the same detailed instructions in multiple languages. it’s basically a big loop with a couple cul de sacs. this complex is situated on a hill, and it has two entrances. my driver was coming up the hill, and i live closer to the first entrance, so my instructions (minus all the language that says where i live) basically said “go in the first entrance, keep driving down the road, and make the first left. also, don’t go to the senior center, the gps sometimes takes drivers there by accident. please call if you get lost.” (this has happened multiple times, no idea why, so weird). anyways, that was all the driver needed to do. these instructions were also in spanish, arabic, and traditional chinese.  
  
so i’m watching the driver come up the hill and i see him turn into the entrance. as i’m preparing to go outside, i get “your order has been delivered!” with this picture attached (you may need to tap on the photo): https://www.reddit.com/r/grubhubdrivers/s/2u2y4t4u3g  
  
and then he left. that image you’re seeing, with my food on the ground, is right next to the entrance. he did not call me. he did not text me. no attempt to communicate with me. this is all that happened. he spent 10 seconds on the premises, dropped my food on the ground, and then left. grubhub gave me a $20 credit for my trouble, so i imagine something happened to the driver.  
  
i thought it was so ridiculous and insane that it would make a good reddit post. because like… come on. what the fuck? who does this? but i got comment after comment saying “you didn’t tip”, “you need to leave better instructions”, and some comments thinking i was the driver..? some comments asking about a gate code or something? i don’t fucking know. so i’m writing this in the hopes that this is coherent enough to understand. i hope it suffices. it wouldn’t let me edit my last post, so figured this would be a better solution.  
  
in short… don’t do this. just don’t.",2024-07-30 04:32:51,Reddit,GrubHub,28,109,

i’m nice.  so i tell the guy and he is like show it to me rachael!!!  lol jk, but he is like can i see the name? i show him my phone and he is like ‘oh we don’t have anyone here at that name.  are you at the wrong place?’

i tell him the address and how the diner said to leave it at the front lobby.  

he is then like “no you can’t leave that here!  what if someone steals it?!”

i just told him the diner told me to leave it down here.  and once they get the order you can chide them because i’m following their direction.  i shrug and leave as he is talking behind my back saying how i can’t leave food there.

i chatted with support and they called and confirmed that the order was already picked up. 

here is the issue i have besides the flat pay of a $1 for a cancelled order. 

i was doing a mission where 6 deliveries between 11am and 1:59pm would get a $24 bonus.

"i may be crazy but.... let me preface this by saying i multi-app daily on gh, ue, and dd. i used to have my gh as a secondary app on the phone i use for uber and noticed i get maybe 5 or 6 offers daily (from morning to when i shut off the app). i now am running gh on a separate phone with no other apps running at the same time and it's triggering probably 25-30 times daily now. i may be crazy but multi-apping all your apps on one phone may cause some issues or possibly other apps have some sort of ai to detect you're multi-apping?

like i said this could all just be coincidental but gh used to pull me about 50-75 weekly and since i've started using a dedicated phone i've easily doubled that amount. last week i pulled in $271 which is an anomaly for my market. so maybe i'm crazy....maybe i'm onto something?????",2024-07-26 11:37:31,Reddit,GrubHub,4,21,

even if i start let’s say 12 pm and go until 9-10pm the most i’ll make is  120 !   the most i’ve made going all day is 144!  

i notice even if the map is bright red and i’m  in the center once i get to a certain dollar amount offers either stop or i get bombarded by no tip offers or low ball high mile offers!

dd $8.25 for 4m popped up which i accepted promptly and before i could go offline with gh , it offered a double $19+ for 8m which i could not resist.

luckily dd dropoff was going in the same direction of 2 gh restaurants. was late on gh but not because of multiapping - food was not ready at the 2nd restaurant, and as everyone knows gh loves to penalize the drivers - no matter what...

2 weeks ago some guy orders three two-piece kfc meals with large drinks on a main street address... i go to the place and me and the customer are on the phone wondering where the hell he is and i am... we eventually figure out that the problem is that somehow grubhub assigned him here in las cruces... but he lives in las vegas. free six-piece original recipe meal with three biscuits, ​three mashed potato sides, and three large mountain dew sweet lightnings... but grubhub only gave me $2 for the order instead of $12.",2024-07-25 02:00:21,Reddit,GrubHub,13,9,

i picked up over $150 worth of food, 2 massive bags. i thought, wow this person must not have tipped anything. after delivery i saw the tip was $8.50ish and the pay was $3.70ish.  
how is this even possible? i did the math vs regular menu price vs grubhub price and grubhub easily made $30+ on this order and i get $3? do you expect a busy restaurant to just be able to whip up a $150 order in the middle of dinner? i waited 15 minutes for a car full of food and got paid $3. lol.

"canceled orders  so apparently grubhub has decided that orders getting canceled by the customer after pick up is complete is no longer paid in full.  despite receiving an email a few weeks ago that sounded like a positive change, something about ""you will now be paid a percentage of the order based on how much of it was complete"" sounds good. oh but no.  instead you just get $1 regardless.


this happened after waiting for an order at kfc $10 for 3 miles. , it was already an hour old when i accepted it and then i continued to wait 30 more minutes for the order.  i finally get the order and start driving, it is only like a few minutes to get to the drop off btw, and they canceled it almost immediately after i selected ""leaving"".  which i don't blame them it had been 1.5 hours at that point.

originally thought this would be a win for me until i saw was only paid $1.  called support and they basically told me to bend over and take the new policy in the ass like a good robot.


thought ""at least i got some free food"", but the food wasn't even what the customer ordered which sounded much better then what i got.  the chicken is all stuck together with the skin falling off all soggy and gross.  pathetic.  can't believe this kfc is still in business.  i so wish i could stop any of their orders from being sent to me at all.

uber at least leads me to the correct unit, without having to run google maps (which apparently sucks in apartments)

"person who works at jail stole food, should i call the jail? i dropped the food off at 1128pm and the diner reported the food as not received by 1145pm.  this was in a secured facility and the only way in was by the intercom.  it was the 4th avenue jail in phoenix arizona which is a large building with many doors.  

prior to dropping off the order i felt the diner was shady because it was the jail building but with no directions. 

so, i messaged the diner asking which door do i deliver the food to?  she said the north west door, and how it was at the corner of this street and the other.  

i texted her every single thing i was doing because ppl with bad directions for huge buildings need to know, “hey, i’m coming with your food” ya know?  like i’m communicating with you so you get your order.  

i arrive at the door, and i press the intercom button and tell them i’m here to drop off this food order for this (female name), and the person who buzzed me in was a female.  

again, this is a jail.  the female buzzes me in and it’s a room that only has an elevator and a dark hallway leading to god knows where.  i felt uncomfortable so i left the food in that foyer room.  it def looked like an area i shouldn’t have been in because it was an employee entrance with an elevator that had a key fob next to it.  so i left the food in that room.  i mean why not? it is the jail.  this person knows which door and i’m assuming it was her that buzzed me in.  i’m texting her and i get no response.  

i dropped the food off and just left.  and then 15 mins later it’s cancelled.  i ask her why? and she said “i never got the food and i didn’t cancel it grubhub did”.

i called grubhub and asked if i was still going to get paid, and they told me yes.  grubhub then told me it wasn’t them that cancelled this order it was the diner who cancelled the order through the app.  

now, i’m like…. this lady, had i not been paid she wouldn’t been messing with my money, but in actuality i’m assuming she stole the food!  

like how are you going to steal food when you work at the city jail in downtown phoenix?  

should i call her work tomorrow and report this?  i have the time i dropped the order off and the time it was marked cancelled.  idk, apart of me wants to call but then another part of me is trying to do the right thing and let the jail know they have someone sus up in there.

(tucson, az) when i started driving for grubhub last year, i saw a bunch of other delivery drivers parking in the center lane on university boulevard. i asked a cop if that was legal, and he told me that ""it's never been a problem before,"" so i started doing the same whenever there's no other temporary parking available.

the other day, i was doing this while picking up an order, and i saw a guy taking a picture of my license plate, and someone else told me that it's now potentially a $280 ticket. apparently the meter people are cracking down now. i got a $10 ticket 2 weeks ago because my meter ran a few minutes over (came out to the people writing the ticket). they've decided to be ruthless.

just thought i'd let any other drivers know about this. kinda sucks that they can't seem to get their story straight. like, why would the tpd tell us something totally different? ",2024-07-15 15:57:24,Reddit,GrubHub,1,3,

"grubhub gave a “you are not moving towards pickup message” while on freeway h heading to pickup location it’s ridiculous but at least i didn’t get auto reassigned. between wifi lapses and gps blockages gh app i s going crazy these days  

btw there is no reason for gh to rush drivers like a first responder going to a fire as unlike fires that had broke out restaurants cannot complete the meal any faster nor can they even get the meal on the fire quicker just because i rushed nor to the door. 

it doesn’t really matter whether i was already in the direction to the pickup before it paged me or finished up what i am doing errands for 4 more minutes ie bathroom my drop off time is exactly the same the food would be out at the same time obviously and the food would arrive to customer the same. so the algorithm should really chill. ironically i noticed their auto reassign idea since ab5 which came same time as covid would’t crack down on multi apping or resulting delays to customers at all the way they set it up. 

also i got a low order attendance violation, not lateness once despite the customer and gh being noticed of restaurant delays. also estimated drop off time is unbeatable nor realistic no matter how fast or smooth the delivery. the while thing is just ridiculous.",2024-07-15 12:14:06,Reddit,GrubHub,2,19,
"money stolen from account  my grubhub driver app and account got exploited and hacked. i could not change/edit the debit card settings. my direct deposit was stolen because someone used exploits and put another debit card routing my money to them. i stopped using the app because of this. just wanted this to be known because i got more than a thousand stolen from me. customer support is not very helpful and i was never notified when my bank account routing was switched. my bank account number changed to the one shown then again to 0000.

the pictures show that i clicked add/edit debit card and then prompted to password when outputted connection error.

as i start driving back with the food, i get a text with the address of the hotel.  hmmm  i don't recognize the city. 🤣🤣🤣  i put it into googlemaps, it's over 100 miles away.

guess what when i use my instant cash card and paid $0.50 it said that the payment was pending. so that means i get no money until tomorrow and i'm wondering if this is just a clue by for that the app is gone bankrupt.

i think it may be bankruptcy because they can't be so stupid that they don't recognize that while people are on the road they need to cash out for various expenses gas oil food drinks etc. this is not something that a lot of people do with a paycheck week to week. so honestly i think this is done.

"how to steal from gh without penalty  i’m tired of dealing with this company and all their issues. not letting us cash out, taking money out of earnings and not telling us why, horrible driver care service that doesn’t respond or resolve issues. this company is failing and is on the verge of collapse and soon it will be bought out by someone else or hopefully it just shuts down once and for all. so to help expedite that process i will be teaching you all how to steal food from grubhub without any penalty and while still getting paid for it. 

step 1.) accept and pick up order as normal 

step 2.) drive towards customers house, get only close enough that your able to mark “arrive.” normally that is when you’re about .2 miles away from the customers house. 

step 3.) mark arrived and then drive down the road to a random house, take a picture of that house (make sure not to include house number in this photo) then submit it and complete the order as complete. at this point now you’ll be paid in full for the delivery and you have the food 

step 4.) if the customer contacts you at all asking where their food is or telling you it was the wrong house, ignore them and block the number. 

step 5.) if grubhub calls you on behalf of the customer, ignore them. if you want to answer you can and just say you delivered the order to the house the gps sent you and it matched the address but you don’t have to answer them. 

step 6.) at this point the customer will most likely have the order canceled, they will get refunded for the order and you will keep the entire pay for the order and keep all the food. congrats! 

this works 100% of the time and you get no violation on your account and there is zero accountability or safeguards from grubhub to prevent us drivers from taking advantage of this system, so enjoy it! you could actually make money for getting free food, how awesome is that! hopefully if enough of us start doing this grubhub will be forced to shut down from losing so much money. grubhub likes to take advantage of drivers, many customers do as well, but why let them? i think it’s time we start taking advantage of them. enjoy!

"just got my first violation after 6000 deliveries i got an email saying “a significant number of your orders were canceled between jun 28, 2024 - jul 5, 2024…. this is your 1st violation. as a reminder, if you have 3 current violations, your account will be blocked.”

so i went on the app to see what orders have been cancelled. were customers stealing orders? was i delivering to the wrong addresses? was i mixing up orders? nope. two orders were canceled by the customer because he thought it was expensive. he ordered twice from the same restaurant and couldn’t figure out how to cancel it until i reached him (different story, he came out to grab it and i said no you cancelled it. he said okay turned around and walked inside). the other 2 orders that were “cancelled” were because of restaurant closure. 

i called support and said how are any of these my fault? why am i penalized for it? they said it’s automatically generated by the system. i asked if anyone checks it before it goes out, they said no. then she proceeded to say it’s only for 3 months. i said that’s not the point, the point is i’m being accused of something that is not my fault at all. they then said there’s nothing to do now, you cannot appeal it even until i get 2 more violations and my account blocked.

i’m sure any of you have encountered these unfair practices from grubhub and others. it’s time to move on and do something else. at this point, any other minimum wage job is better.",2024-07-06 11:12:19,Reddit,GrubHub,16,13,

"a frustrating experience. so i reactivated my account, just for the extra income for the summer.  appeal was accepted mid-may. and had to order a new driver card through driver care as for some reason it wouldn't let me through the app. card arrived in time for a schedule at the end of may. monday, no issues whatsoever and being that i live in a region with hourly play a slow day isn't all that upsetting. wednesday however.... this is where the frustration of gh begins. 

  
i get an order 1 1/2 hours into my first block, nearing completion, i noticed that my app had marked me unavailable and that i needed to update my app in order to mark myself available, complete the delivery, complete the process so gh doesn't think i'm awol and i still can't mark myself available... i call driver care to see what's up and get told to uninstall and reinstall to see if that fixes it.. it didn't. i get hit with the screen of  needing to reactivate my account etc.. the driver care specialist... realizes that my account was apparently and mistakenly flagged as inactive mid shift.... so i get marked as absent for 3 of my 5 blocks scheduled. my account finally gets activated and despite gh knowingly aware that the fault was on their own side.. i wasn't given any reimbursement for lost pay and would not receive any.. so accountability is clearly out of the question as usual.

  
the kicker - my new driver card won't be reactivated via the app as it continuously gives me errors.. i notify gh of this and they ask for me to send a photo of my card to activate it, they state it's activated though the app doesn't reflect that. i reiterate this to them and they \\of course ignored it. few weeks later i get an order that requires me to use my card and low and behold it doesn't work.. which kills my entire schedule and availability... contact care once again and it turns out that when they activated my card, they activated a completely different card that wasn't even in my possession.. alongside my card.... once again no accountability taken.. no reimbursement.. but hey my card is once again active again ""could be a lie though""

  
now onto a rather recent matter.. while waiting for order #9 as weekend shifts are often busier than weekday.. i get a notification that i missed 2 orders and would be flagged if i miss 3rd.. upon checking my app. no orders were missed and this oddly comes after an order was cancelled 2 hours after it was delivered. the customer tried to say it was never delivered despite gh showing them the picture of where the food was delivered which had their house number in direct view. (gotta love people trying to get free meals.) seeing as i never missed an order, i close out the app and open again and it oddly now shows that i missed an order 5 minutes ago despite it never reaching my app or notification.. i call driver care to see just what that was about... and they give me the run around saying i must have been in bad service.. i was right next to the restaurant that was intended for that order with full 5g... needless to say it just seemed like another common hiccup with the app, and of course my profile reflects on 2 missed orders instead of 1 or what should have been 0.

"i'm done with grubhub. final straw was today with mile-baiting. i'm done with driving for grubhub as of today. i'm fed up with their latest pathetic trend of mile-baiting on their offers. i noticed they started lying about the total mileage of orders they offer about two months ago. 

it wasn't that bad, the miles were usually more than shown in the offer by one to three miles. pissed me off but i could deal with it. 

today was the fucking final straw. they offered me an applebee's order at 2.2 miles for $12. great! i went to pick the order up. when i picked it up, the map showed it was 15 fucking miles! that's way below $1 a mile. 

i called support, told them to cancel the order because i refuse to be cheated like this. they warned me that i'll be penalized for it, i told them to go fuck themselves because at that point, i'm never delivering for gh again. and told them to tell their boss to stuff it up their ass, and the customer can starve because they didn't tip close to enough to compensate for the distance. 

i didn't even bother returning the food to applebee's. my wife is enjoying the food as of now, grubhub can get fucked! and fuck the entitled customer, too. 

deleted the app, don't care if i got a cv at all. what can they do to me? hah! at least doordash is my main source of gig income, grubhub has done down the shitter and the orders barely even come by anymore.

since then, the suggested tips have gone from 12%/15%/20% to 5%/7%/10%!!! they've also added a new ""other fee,"" which is usually $1 or $2. so now we have delivery fee, service fee, and other fee. can anyone with nyc gh driving experience share how much exactly goes to drivers out of these fees? i want to make sure i'm tipping appropriately. also, do you expect the tip to be a percentage of the total food + tax, or the entire total after all fees? or is it more about distance/effort, since most nyc gh drivers use bikes & mopeds? and how much is ebt in nyc these days (or is that just a doordash thing?)? finally, for folks like me who don't pay any delivery fee and a reduced service fee because of amazon prime, do drivers get a reduced amount from all prime members, or do you still get the same amount and someone else 'swallows' that discount?

"gh using gps of former address has anyone heard of gh sending a driver to a customer’s former address via gps, even though that address is no longer in the account, and the correct current address is printed on the receipt? 

so, i order tonight, the system tells me the order has been delivered, but when i go to find it at the front desk of my apartment building, nothing is there (there are detailed instructions about the name of my building and how to drop off in my account). i check the photo the driver took and it is definitely not my address. moments later i get a text from the resident of the address it was delivered to (having found my phone number on the receipt), and it turns out to be the house next to where i lived almost 10 years ago. the two addresses are across town from one another.

gh had the order redelivered, and when the second order was delivered the new driver called and asked if the address on the receipt was right (it was) because “the gps is really messed up.” this driver clearly paid attention to the address on the order but was confused about why the gps was trying to send him to another part of town. 

when i look at both past orders in the app, they show a drop off location pin of my old address, but the order clearly has my current and current address on it. my account also clearly has my current address in it and no other, though it surely once had my old address in it. 

besides being in different parts of town, the two street names are nothing alike. i think the part of it being next door to my old address is that my current and correct address begins 231 [current street name] and it was left at 331 [old street name] and it was trying to take the driver to my old address at 333 [old street name]. first driver didn’t read clearly on several accounts, but he was also led astray by the gps.

"2 dollar corporate rate deliveries my last job told us we can use grubhub for free deliveries if we signed up with our email.  which made things come to perspective.  i always wondered why there was a rise of 2 dollar offers, and that’s why.  ppl are signing up with their work email to get delivery fees waived.  

i’m not hating the game, but once i decline those orders they’ll sometimes come back to me with the same dollar amount.  lately, once i decline them they no longer rotate back to me.  which makes me think that there is someone taking these 2 dollar offers.  

who in phoenix is taking these orders?  you need to decline them.  we need to stand together with declining these 2 dollar offers.

i get back in, explain a couple times, that i couldn’t mark the delivery arrived and that i can’t make the next pickup on time because of the bad pin and the detour… she pretty much gets it, first time 🙂

she asks me if i’m willing to proceed with/to the next pickup… i tell her i’m already on the way!

okay she says, can you make 4:56? *it’s a 4 minute buffer

i thank her, tell her she’s awesome, and hang up

another issue i run into is when i do see the order on screen and hit accept, it'll refresh and mark it as missed anyways. i don't care about my acceptance rate all that much, but it's frustrating because this always happens with high paying orders. i wanted to know if this was commonly an android thing or its the fault of the app overall. i was thinking of buying a small used iphone just for delivery gigs to help as i've heard this issue isn't nearly as prominent on ios. i wanted to hear some insight from others before doing anything.

"has anyone actually gotten grubhub to pay out on a mistakenly cancelled order? or, for that matter, even gotten a call back from anyone when you elevate a concern?

i had a pickup at a wetzel's pretzels inside a walmart that wasn't plotting correctly, so it wouldn't let me arrive myself at the location. so i called in to have driver care arrive me as i was walking in. while i was waiting for a live human being to answer, i asked for the order, and they told me it had been picked up by another driver. it was a $15 order with about 6 miles to the store from the notification. i told the rep that eventually answered what happened....misplaced location, couldn't arrive, already picked up. i did that from the parking lot. for 5 minutes this guy stumbled around trying to find my account, trying to find the active job, and i'm getting the automated notifications that i accepted an offer but hadn't picked up yet the whole time. he finally tells me he's having computer problems and that i should call back. at the same time, i get notification that i've been removed from the delivery. i ask him if he did that and he said yes, and that i should call back about the cancelation pay. 

so i immediately call back, and for 7 more minutes i try to explain the situation to a different rep. she tries to tell me that i got dropped from the order because i never marked myself as arrived, so i wasn't eligible for cancelation pay. we went round and round and i explained the facts 3 or 4 more times until i asked to speak with a manager.

manager comes on, listens to the whole story again, and eventually says someone else from driver care will contact me, and there's nothing else she can do. 

i called back a 3rd time a couple of hours later to ask when i should expect the call from driver care. i was told i would get an email in a couple of days. that was on a wednesday. 

the next monday, i call again, since i haven't gotten an email. this rep drags things out for 5 or 6 minutes and finally tells me that the decision was made not to pay cancelation pay since i never arrived myself. i immediately asked for a manager again, and the rep says i will get a call back from a manager. that was 2 days ago...no callback. 

i'm not going to starve if i don't get paid for this, but at this point it's the principle of the whole thing. i want to know what i should have done differently to get cancelation pay in this case, and i'm willing to waste some time on hold (while doing other things) until someone in driver care actually answers my questions. 

anyone had any luck getting through the gatekeeper frontline reps to actually talk with someone who can actually answer questions without a script and has the authority to make a decision? i know uber eats managers can do so, and are normally pretty good to work with, but so far i'm getting stonewalling by grubhub, and it's pissing me off.

i just don't know how much longer this company is gonna last, the stock is almost all but destroyed, the only reason it's normalized is because the company bought their shares back during the decline. yes they used what little profits they had to buy their shares back to save the company.

taken from a recent (april 2024) [reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/just-eat-takeaway-posts-q1-gross-transaction-value-above-expectations-2024-04-17/) report:

>its gtv grew by 11% in key uk and ireland markets and by 5% in northern europe, another major one for the company, offsetting an **11% drop in north america** and a 15% decrease in southern europe and australia, the company said.

>""half of the group's business remains down in the double digits and affects the group's growth/cash generation profile,"" genelot added.

>just eat said its constant currency gtv growth excluding north america of 3% in the quarter was within the 2024 guidance range of 2% to 6% increase.

>**the group said it was still exploring a partial or full sale of its struggling u.s. unit grubhub.**

>on monday, it announced its exit from new zealand.

i don't have a lot of hope looking at the future for us gh drivers. the company seems to be spending a lot of money on marketing though and expanding into different kinds of deliveries like groceries. i'm sure it won't be long before gh will either be dissolved, bought at a bargain (although why would anyone buy a company that is losing money), or maybe merged with dd or ue.

7am to 9am
9am to 11am

i got no orders from 7-9, so didn’t make 12. i got orders 9-11 but didn’t take 90% of the orders yet made over $12.

shouldn’t i get the gh pay from 7-9? 1. i didn’t get any orders, 2. didn’t make $12. 3. didn’t get orders to go below the 90% threshold?

"can i become a driver for just a few weeks? unemployed and house hunting gave me an idea. i've moved to the triangle area in nc, and i'm shopping for a house with my partner. i quit my job and am on sabbatical while we decide where we want to end up settling here. my job is to scope potential neighborhoods.

i used to deliver food (pre-app era) back in college, and it was such an efficient way to get familiar with all the streets/neighborhoods in a town. 

instead of aimlessly driving around neighborhoods wasting gas, i thought why not do some food delivery work for a few weeks and make a few bucks while i'm at it? just a couple of questions:



* is there any reason i can't sign up and just drive for a few weeks? 3-6 weeks likely.
* is it pointless if i'm only working during lunchtime? i'm not really doing it for the income, but is that generally a busy time?
* is it true that new drivers have a ""honeymoon"" period where they get the best orders? i've heard this theory about doordash. new drivers get preferential treatment for a few weeks in order to ""hook"" them before things level off. if true, great! i'll take advantage. but is that just a conspiracy theory?

again, i'm not expecting to earn significant income driving just 4-5 hours a day. i'd just like to do slightly better than breaking even, i guess.

anyway, i'm just looking for a gut check on this idea and wondering if there are any pitfalls i'm not considering. thanks!",2024-06-10 15:10:21,Reddit,GrubHub,6,16,

still, almost every time i order food, the driver calls me saying they’re in front of building 5 and they’re confused.

"gh ratings metric scenario & business for drivers... restaurant arrival time - if the drivers don't press arrived button on time then the drivers are marked as late even though they might have arrived on time...

does it mean gh's location service doesn't work???

many gig companies nowadays use drop-off time for ratings purposes which should make a common sense.

gh app is perhaps less driver friendly... if you are doing a dbl the customers don't  know about it & they try to trash the you on call/ text  - and gh is silent...

acceptance rate should not play any role in deciding whether drivers should get more business or big orders etc. 

it's a contract & drivers should be free to accept / reject orders at will... however gh loves to embarrass drivers by showing 3 boxes etc ...

i do shipt as well, which is owned by target - they got rid of accetance rate way long ago because they realized that it's an insult to independent contractors to force into something they are not comfortable with especially business wise.

if the restaurant is closed upon arrival ( especially on public holidays ) gh doesn't pay anything to drivers for making an attempt to drive to the restaurant, time & gas. ubereats pays $3 - $4 out of respect.

it should all boil down to how many deliveries a driver successfully completed ( completion rate ) with good customer ratings. it should not be based on how many a driver missed.

on blocks front - there is no penalty to quit blocks anytime on doordash or shipt. giving more business to drivers on a block is debatable. all do that and i like that but if you trash driver ratings due to ridiculous accepance or restaurant arrival time etc then how on earth good drivers are supposed to blocks &  get more business?

i propose only 2 - completion % ( after accepting ) &  dropoff time.

at the end of the day gh or any other gig companies will do what they feel right for their business... there are no 2s about it... but can't they strike a good balance & avoid throwing insults thru app? 

the current gh ratings metric doesn't make sense. this is on top of very less money offered by gh for very long distances. many blame newbies but i blame the high inflation & economy which is forcing drivers to accept nonsensical orders.

i understand it is tl but there are many more points which i perhaps didn't mention here... like food not received etc.

gh gave me solid money in the past so no qualms, sitting near 4000 deliveries but don't feel like doing as my main one anymore. still respect & love gh and always hoping for positive changes.

what do you guys think? - do you have any other points to contribute? 

it would be very interesting to have your views.

later i noticed that even though i was paid, the earnings page said the order was canceled. i called support because i figured something sus was going on, and sure enough the agent told me the customer said it was not delivered. i explained the situation, and the agent said she saw my photo of the drop off and said she screenshotted everything and included my statement about what happened. she assured me i would be fine.

"grubhub driver app glitching i've been delivering on grubhub app for about 4 years & never had this issue. 
let me preface by saying i'm running on android & have uninstalled & reinstalled the app several times to no avail. 
the glitch is: the app plays the cowbell noise to notify of an offer, but won't show me an offer; when i then swipe the app off my screen & press the icon to bring it back up, it shows i've missed 1 offer, do this a 2nd time, it shows i've missed 2 offers, do it a 3rd time & it shows i've missed 3 offers & signs me out. do it a 4th time & it finally shows the gold offer banner across the top of the screen & allows me to tap it to view the offer.
i can then accept or reject it, and need to sign back in to receive further offers. 
when i check my earnings list to see all offers, none have been listed as missed, because i've missed none.
i also concurrently run ubereats & spark, with no issues from those.
i'm guessing maybe spark is causing the issue with grubhub, but not sure.

tonight, i literally put in my instructions "" knock on my door"" because i'm sick of getting cold food.  again, no update, no knock.   i always tip well, a minimum of 20%, and i never change the tip, so it's not that. checked the door, theres my food sitting there, cold.

"3 proven ways to profit more # dear drivers

it's getting harder to earn a decent income with gig delivery apps. inflation drives up costs for fuel, insurance, and car repairs, cutting into profits. it also reduces consumer demand when prices rise - no one is going to pay $50 for a happy meal!

on top of that, the companies behind **these apps are extremely greedy**. they flood the market with drivers, pay them less than they should, and use algorithms to pressure them into accepting bad offers.

**so what power do we have?**

# the power to say no, slow, or go go go

**option 1: say no to all bad offers**

very simply say no to bad offers. do not let the manipulation of app metrics like acceptance rates affect you. if everyone lived by this rule, the algorithm will start to shift and raise the offer. and there is a lot of room for them to increase. but it wont happen until it starts to happen collectively! say no to trash!

**option 2: go slow on all bad offers**

this only applies to states that have 'earn by time'. if you receive a $5 offer (bad offer!) , the only way you can profit is by delivering slowly. this way your active time pay goes up. so instead of doing that in 10 minutes, push it to 20.

this of course means you are tied up for 10 minutes more and wont get new offers then. most likely though, because of over saturation, you wont be getting an offer.

so it may make sense to take subpar offers and deliver them much slower than usual.

**option 3: go fast only on good offers**

this applies if you get a decent order. it wouldnt make sense to try to increase. your 'earn by time' because if you finish the order quickly you have more time left in that hour to receive another offer. this will increase your hourly rate.

**so its up to you and us, we can say no, slow, or go go.**  
**you control when the wheels move.**

"a discussion on proposition 22 (california) and why you should be premiere and do every order. well i live in california and with proposition 22 we are garuenteed 120% of the local minimum wage in the city we pick up in plus .34¢ per mile. 

in los angeles, grubhub uses ≈ $16.156 as its hourly rate. now multiply 1.2 to $16.156 you get $19.38. 

for every active hour you work you'll earn $19.38. 

so 40 hours of active time equals a guarentee of $775.48. you cannot make less than that because it's law. it's guarenteed. 

now that we have our earnings for active time lets include the miles.

let's say that week you drove 400 miles. you went up and down your entire delivery region. 

note: these are the miles you add up based on what grubhub says you drove not the miles you think you drove.

so 400 x .34¢ = $136. take those $136 and add it to your $775.48 and you get a total of

$911.48 in proposition 22 earnings.

now let's add the tips.

let's say customer tips added to $100. 

$100(tips) + $775.48(active time) + $136 (400 miles) = $1,011.48 (total earnings)

if at the end of the week grubhub only paid you $910.48(active time + miles), 

no big deal thats where the $1 adjustment will be added on monday morning. 

if grubhub paid you $912.48(active time + miles) well congrats you earned more than the guarentee.

grubhub doesn't have an endless supply of money to hand out so not everyone is going to receive 40 hours of active time. who do you think is more likely to receive it? a premiere driver who does the work or a cherry picking partner account? you're not outsmarting the system, they will stop sending you offers, plain and simple, if you're off block they have no obligation to send you anything.


and this isn't exclusive to grubhub, this applies to doordash and uber eats as well. although i don't know what those apps use at their hourly base but it shouldn't be too far  off.

the exception to this is 10:00 and later. the hours they can't find people to work. when there's nothing going on or it's late at night, you will never get logged out of this fucker. not one single time in the more than 4 years i've been on grubhub have i ever been logged out by grubhub after 10:00. i will get logged out at 7:00 though for sure

lol

i know it sounds totally paranoid but i forgot the app was still running and then i got a ping 2 hours after i'd gone home. that's twice this week that has happened. so they absolutely 100% choose when and when not to log you out

gh logged me off at 5:00 and then again at 7:00 and 7:30
they absolutely know you're running a different gig app at the same time. 

cocksuckers.

"the dark side of delivery apps: how algorithms exploit workers and perpetuate inequality 
introduction:
in an era dominated by convenience and instant gratification, delivery apps like grubhub, uber eats, and doordash have revolutionized the way we order food. however, behind the sleek interfaces and promises of easy income lies a darker truth: the exploitation of delivery drivers through algorithmic manipulation.

the algorithm: always watching, always knowing
delivery apps utilize sophisticated algorithms to manage their fleets of drivers and optimize their operations. these algorithms track an extensive array of data points, including driver location, activity patterns, and even personal habits. from where you live to the speed at which you drive, these algorithms leave no stone unturned in their quest to predict and control driver behavior.

the impact on drivers:
for drivers, this constant surveillance has profound implications. drivers find themselves at the mercy of algorithms that prioritize profit over fair treatment. the algorithmic system is designed to ""starve the poor,"" favoring drivers in wealthier areas or those who can afford to work full-time. drivers living in low-income neighborhoods or relying on delivery gigs as a primary source of income are systematically disadvantaged.

the illusion of progress:
moreover, the algorithmic structure perpetuates a facade of progress while trapping drivers in a cycle of exploitation. despite promises of flexibility and upward mobility, drivers find themselves trapped in a system that offers little room for advancement. income levels are predetermined by algorithms that prioritize profitability for the company rather than the well-being of its workers.

the danger of algorithms:
the implications of these algorithms extend beyond the realm of delivery apps. they represent a broader trend in which technology is wielded as a tool of oppression, reinforcing existing inequalities and exacerbating socio-economic disparities. by relegating drivers to mere pawns in a profit-driven game, these algorithms pose a threat to the dignity and livelihoods of millions.

conclusion:
as consumers, we must confront the uncomfortable truth behind the convenience of delivery apps. we must demand transparency and accountability from companies that profit off the labor of others. it's time to recognize the human cost behind the algorithmic curtain and advocate for fair treatment and dignity for all workers, regardless of their socio-economic status. only then can we truly dismantle the systems of oppression perpetuated by technology and pave the way for a more just and equitable society.",2024-05-05 20:48:25,Reddit,GrubHub,8,16,

"🚫 it’s time to take action: join the movement against grubhub, doordash, and uber eats! 🚫  attention all food lovers, restaurant owners, and delivery enthusiasts! 

enough is enough! we're tired of being at the mercy of corporate giants like grubhub, doordash, and uber eats. it's time to reclaim control over our food delivery experience and support local businesses.

these companies are devouring our wallets with hefty fees, leaving restaurants struggling to survive and customers paying inflated prices. they dictate terms, exploit workers, and monopolize the market, all while lining their pockets with our hard-earned money.

but guess what? we have the power to change this narrative! it's time to unite and take a stand against these behemoths. here's how you can get involved:

1. **spread the word:** share this post far and wide. let your friends, family, and fellow redditors know about the injustices perpetuated by these delivery giants. use social media, forums, and word of mouth to amplify our message.

2. **boycott third-party apps:** refuse to support grubhub, doordash, and uber eats. opt for alternative delivery options such as direct ordering from restaurants or using local delivery services. every dollar withheld from these corporations is a step towards dismantling their monopoly.

3. **support local businesses:** stand in solidarity with your favorite neighborhood restaurants. order directly from them whenever possible to ensure they receive the full value of your purchase. let's keep our communities vibrant and thriving.

4. **contact legislators:** advocate for fair regulations and policies that protect both restaurants and consumers from the predatory practices of third-party delivery apps. write to your local representatives, sign petitions, and participate in grassroots campaigns.

5. **raise awareness:** organize protests, rallies, and community events to raise awareness about the negative impact of third-party delivery apps. engage with local media outlets to amplify our message and hold these companies accountable.

together, we can reclaim control over our food delivery ecosystem and build a more equitable future for all. join the movement today and let's put an end to the reign of grubhub, doordash, and uber eats! 💪🍔🍕 #boycottbigdelivery #supportlocalrestaurants #takebackourfooddelivery",2024-05-05 11:04:24,Reddit,GrubHub,0,55,

"restaurants requiring signatures and fill out sheets and confirmation prior to releasing food just spoke with corporate kfc as we have a location doing this which has led to nasty interactions between me and them. one time where i did all that was required and verified with one worker and second worker wasn’t satisfied and wanted a screenshot of the order which i could not do because i already accepted with the previous worker. ended in a ghost delivery. second time, they wanted my name and signature on top of all order information. i put grubhub. they said no they want my name because they have that other info already to which i said, then why are you making me write it all down? i don’t work for you and if gh isn’t providing my name then you don’t need it. and then they wouldn’t release food without it. another ghost order. customers were understanding and just requested refunds and i advised to never order from that location again. 

i called corporate and they apologized and said they will be contacting the store to get rid of this system as it is not suppose to be happening. so if you’re experiencing this where you live i suggest calling their company’s corporate line and reporting them.

"starting getting payment delays. gh going out of business?  i've had many jobs in my 73 years.  back in the 70s, i worked as a bartender, and a couple of restaurants, my paycheck would occasionally bounce.  they would always make good the next day,  'run it through again' i was told.  however, it happened twice, on a couple of restaurants, and both of them went out of business within 2 months.  these 'payment delay, you'll get paid on (in a few more days)'  is kinda like the modern day digital equivalent of those bounced checks. gh says 'due to a glitch'.  i  doubt it, i'm thinking they are having cash flow problems, and to my way of thinking, they are close to closing up shop.  gh pays drivers more than the other apps, and that's a good thing and the public show know about it.  also, the delivery fees are probably higher and that is why we are losing market share.  what gh should do, is sell some stock, invest the money in a star-studded pr campaign, 'yes, we charge a little more, but our drivers are paid more' and i think the public would find the extra delivery charge worth it, if they knew that and we would get back that lost business.  anyone agree?   or, bad idea?

"does a big tip cause a problem for drivers?   serious question.  am i causing a problem by tipping more?  i use grubhub almost daily because i have a disability.   i am lucky enough to be able to afford it and i also know that i treat the service differently than a typical customer because of my disability.   i don't tip the 20% or 30% as a rule,  unless it comes out to at least $8 because i know it's a service for the delivery not a service restaurant tip.  my general rule is that it's a $10 tip.  and i also try to make sure that i only order from less than a mile away.

key important details:  i am a ""no contact customer""  and i don't use a cell phone,  so it's supposed to be that they just leave it at the door and send a text.  but i never see the text until later.

i've had two issues recently that made me wonder if i'm actually causing a problem for the driver.   so just now i ordered from dunkin and got two things and gave a $20 tip just thinking,  ""hey, let me start someone's day out great!""

the problem i've seen is that if i tip more than the actual cost of the items  (the cost was $14.59)  it seems to cause a delay?     

i usually want to make sure any driver gets at least $10 tip for the delivery,  and then whatever extra grub hub pays.   so i sometimes order a lot of things just to jack up the tip.   but i feel like it's a waste of money and i'd rather just make the drivers day and give them the extra money in the tip.

is this causing some unseen problem that i don't realize?   
also,  do the drivers know that i'm a reliable customer based on my address?

they had put the address as one place, and set the pin on the map somewhere completely different, and got extremely mad at me when i tried to explain that when i have two contradicting addresses, and the customer doesn’t answer the phone🙄 i kind of just have to take a shot in the dark and stay in the rough area of where i dropped off the food and wait for the call saying i put it at the wrong house. more , worse, stuff happened but again i’ll spare you all the details.

i called support and told them about the interaction , and they apologized, marked the order as delivered (i had driven away from the customers house and pulled over to call support) and told me they were ‘reporting this to grubhub so they know to put a violation on that customer’s account’, but what does that mean for the customer?",2024-04-27 00:20:23,Reddit,GrubHub,1,3,

"almost scammed out of a weeks earnings.  so last week i got a phone call and the caller id was the same as any other grubhub call. the person identified themselves as grubhub and told me there was a complaint against my account that said i did not look like the driver who is supposed to pick up the order. they said i needed to verify some information and they would cancel the order. i was headed to pick up and replace it immediately with another order after the verification process was done. i pulled over and started to deal with him on the issue now keep in mind they had my phone number and my email address and the order i was on did get canceled. this gave me the impression it was a legitimate call and i needed to take care of it.  i was sent an email and asked to verify some information from my account. after replying to the email, i was told i would be sent another email with a new password to be used until my payout on thursday. that was the part that made me feel this might be a little sketchy, but given the fact that while i was doing all this, they had a lot of my information already so i proceeded with their instructions. when i log back into my account, i immediately received another order which was a double pick up paying better and i ended the call and proceeded with my day.  in the back of my mind, it bothered me that they provided the password for me to use and they asked me not to do a cash out until i get paid on thursday.  a little voice in my head told me this seemed slightly sketchy and i needed to keep checking my account, specifically my bank information.  sunday night after i finished my last block for the week i was sitting at home and around 2 am. i started getting massively spammed on my email account.  i’m talking about well over 100 emails in rapid succession from places i’ve never been to online. thankfully, my initial reaction was to go to my grubhub account and check my account information again.  well, wouldn’t you know it? my bank information had been changed to a different routing number and account number. i immediately logged out changed my password logged back in and changed my bank information back to my account. thankfully, grubhub puts a 72 hour hold on any payouts after your account information is changed, i had to wait three days for them to re-verify my banking information on thursday morning my bank account where i discovered i did receive my pay.  the way i figured it was they spammed my email to cover the fact that i did receive an email from grubhub. alerting me that my bank information had been changed.

once completed, she took the food and immediately called grubhub to say someone else picked up the order (the cancelation cited the restaurant didn't have certain menu items, so they canceled it). when i called the restaurant to inquire i was told that the driver (they gave me her name and it was the same name of the driver assigned to my order), picked up the order herself and that the order was complete (no missing items).

"In the past few months, it seems that the quality of customer service AND drivers has declined.

I have physical card. they don't pay you any money to deliver food. they send offers for $3 and $5. their customer service sucks. they play games with you just to irritate you on purpose. customer service is so terrible they will make you crash your car when they spin you around in circles and play nasty games with you,2025-04-09 06:21:38,Google Play,GrubHub,0,,1

here's a summary that perfectly describes grubhub. you order something and try to me nice and tip the highest amount to the driver. the driver can't legally open your bag and check that you have everything. you get your order and things are missing. you get with grubhub help and they reimburse you for the base cost of the item. you just lost more money because you tried to be nice in tipping the highest amount. that seems unfair. they di nothing to fix your actual spending for an order. thanks,2025-04-08 20:47:47,Google Play,GrubHub,1,,1

Used to be a great idea and a way to try new foods. Unfortunately now most food is delivered cold because the drivers are doubling up on deliveries causing them to miss delivery times.

The app is fine but as a company GrubHub (in my opinion) is pretty terrible. Orders are consistently late or get cancelled because they can't find a driver. If you have no drivers then there needs to be a way keep us from ordering in the first place or at least let us know how many are working so customers can get a sense of real time availability. Then half the time they won't even cancel so you're stuck waiting on food that will likely never come.,2025-03-27 19:24:53,Google Play,GrubHub,0,,1

Grubhub drivers are incompetent. I have had so many problems with drivers leaving my food outside or dropping off at the wrong location. I guess they don't know how to read. Literal idiots.

There is a serious glitch right now. Just lost 2/3's of an order and this is not the first time. Currently if you place an order with Priority Delivery and your order is late you receive an automatic refund. This prevents you from opening a support ticket for that order because the app views the $1 delivery refund as a resolved case. Last time I only lost a coffee but this time I lost two full meals worth $20 each and the AI bot you can access through Help only offered $5 in credit.,2025-03-14 17:56:25,Google Play,GrubHub,3,,1

The app isn't the issue it's the service itself. They need to update their system to what DD uses or something similar. They are so slow it takes 2 hrs to get an order from a place that's 10 minutes away. Yeah I can get it myself but not the point. I'm not always able to get out and I'm willing to pay for it to be delivered to me and I actually tip well. Drivers get lost or take weird ways to get to my house and it takes them longer. Just annoying. They don't care which is why I'm cancelling.,2025-03-07 20:41:09,Google Play,GrubHub,51,,1

"it's not applying promotions, it'll say add two more dollars to your cart to save and then you do it and no discount is applied.

I swear the people who be driving for GrubHub don't understand how driving works...or numbers...or tips...or time. And the best was when one didn't read my very specific and accurate delivery instructions because she couldn't speak a word of English and insisted I instruct her to my apartment in my very bad Spanish. Like.... Why?! Why do I keep paying for this trash? Because I'm a lazy POS.... But still.,2025-02-27 22:00:43,Google Play,GrubHub,1,,1

I just had it happen AGAIN and when I called the restaurant, they couldn't even tell me why it was cancelled, because the driver picked it up. None of it ever makes sense and I never get answers as to why, because ""I was refunded"". Well I don't want refunds 10 days later or be tiping drivers that never show.

It's harder to find certain foods and the options aren't as widespread as Uber in particular. Also, for some reason all the stores close earlier on Grubhub than on Uber Eats, so Grubhub misses the mark for night owls.

They even once took an hour, disabled the UI, and called me to make sure I wasnt doing something illegal by trying to tip extra!! Sometimes it rains or elevator breaks.

"services from this app vary dramatically from food to drivers to customer services, and that doesn't necessarily mean it's a good thing. you can have a speedy driver and cold food or have your order delivered to the wrong location if you happen to be working, and not enough deals appear to save enough from making it worth convincing that delivery is better then pick up. Continuing using this app shows how terrible their customer service is at this point. Still disappointed.",2025-01-27 22:22:21,Google Play,GrubHub,18,,1

But literally the last 3 or 4 times I ordered it was late, missing stuff. I'm only giving it 2 stars because it's still slightly better than going myself.",2025-01-20 13:28:27,Google Play,GrubHub,23,,2
"Been using for quite a while now. It not only charges more for food than the restaurants do in person, but it tacks on several fees. Tip is basicslly mandatory from initial order and you can't change it if the service is poor, and poor service is what you tend to get.

"This is not about deliverers and food, which are usually great. Specifically for this service and app, I cannot add tip after delivery on the app and they make me have to call customer service to adjust afterward.

GrubHub is the only service involving transactions that I have used that does not apply gift card credits by default. And then trying to get the credit applied after the order is a headache. They do not give their customer support a line of escalation and simply say there is nothing they can do.

Customer service are no help with no situation whatsoever the delivery drivers are bad and they do not like to give you your money back when it's their fault on the situation I recommend Uber eats order anybody but GrubHub for your food and customer service experience cuz you're not going to get nowhere and they will hold your money and not want to give you a refund after you order food I highly suggest never to order from them and the customer service is foreign and barely speak English,2025-01-12 12:28:47,Google Play,GrubHub,1,,1

GrubHub is predatory they randomly give free trails and weave the consent into your order next thing you know you are being charged monthly.

Absolutely terrible. It seems these days grubhub could care less about actual customer service. The drivers are rude and ignorant (even driving on my lawn) and my food nearly ALWAYS arrives cold.

Dropped the ball for the second time. Last time order was very late. This time they kept me waiting for an hour with delay notifications twice and finally canceled.

It's pretty good. Only issues is that I can't always rate the orders when prompted and it's frustrating to see restaurants that are closer to me than the ones listed not be available. Taco Bell is within the same parking lot as McDonald's but I can't order McDonald's when I can order Taco Bell. It doesn't make sense and it's frustrating.,2024-10-24 13:18:09,Google Play,GrubHub,11,,4

I've been a customer of this app for years! Never had an issue and previously was refunded for different issues I had. But now their customer service sucks. There's no true resolution.

Grubhub made it easy for a friend to show they cared while I was sick. They sent me some Grubhub money and ordered some ramen to be delivered as a surprise.

BAD FOR BUSINESS - BAD FOR USERS. Did you know several restaurants charge more when you order through Grubhub? Apps like these not only charge users fees - but restaurants as well. I would suggest calling the restaurant directly to save money for you and the restaurant.

"The drivers are terrible. On several occasions including this morning, a driver delivered my order to the incorrect address and declined all calls I attempted to make with them.

"Took 2 hrs to have my food delivered when I specifically chose a restaurant that was quick delivery time (15-30min). The restaurant puts the time the order was completed on a receipt on the inside of the bag and they completed the order within 10min of receiving it.

"Fraudsters, essentially stole my money I created my 1st GrubHub account about 30 min. ago. GrubHub sent my order to the wrong location not the Wendy's about 200ft from me on campus. It wouldn't let me cancel in the app even though the app said the order was going to be delayed. When I contacted customer service they told me that they could not assist me because I had had too many concessions or refunds on my account which is not possible since I have never had a GrubHub account before.

Grub hub now requires you to interact with the driver and provide them a code. Almost missed my delivery because of this.,2024-10-17 05:52:02,Google Play,GrubHub,0,,1
"Great app for ordering pickup. We live in a rural town and shop in a larger (rural) town. It's nice to be able to place an order at one of dozens of restaurants as we wrap up shopping and then take it home to eat. The app is pretty easy to use and customer service is solid. I do wish it kept a longer order history, but the only real complaint is that the app really struggles with accessing and distinguishing different locations of a franchise in the same town.",2024-10-16 23:52:11,Google Play,GrubHub,22,,4
"GH is my favorite delivery app, but lately, I have had a huge problem pop up: I meet my drivers outside, curbside, as I live in a massive apt complex in NYC with no street parking. This means I need to know when my driver is on the way so I can be outside for them, so they don't have to park & they don't have to wait. Lately, I'm getting the update ""on the way"" when they're IN my building desperately looking for me. Please fix GPS tracking like ALL the other major apps!!!",2024-10-16 21:57:25,Google Play,GrubHub,6,,3
"I have had multiple issues with incorrect orders. They handled it well for the most part, gave me refunds for past messed up orders. I got another wrong order tonight, went to the help center, because while I understand it's not really their fault I was given the wrong order, it's 22 dollars I spent on an order I didn't get. They said they couldn't give me any more refunds because I had an ""unusual amount of refunds."" That's not my fault. I'll be deleting my account and switching to doordash.",2024-10-16 21:34:12,Google Play,GrubHub,10,,1
One of the worst delivery apps I ever used the drivers dropped of at the wrong location twice. With specific instructions and still delivered it at the wrong location. The cherry on top is that I got blamed for both times with the wrong addresses even though they were. never again. Door dash clears this app. The customer service was bad too.,2024-10-16 21:21:43,Google Play,GrubHub,22,,1

"Several times I have had orders delivered to wrong buildings or doors of my apartment complex, or received someone else's order. I have specified directions to every manner I can. You're better off just going to get the food yourself. At least that way you know where it is rather than hunt around for it. Been meaning to delete this app for a long time, I'm just sorry that it's taken me this long.

"items in menu need more description, but that is probably per vendor. otherwise great experience using the app",2024-10-16 18:38:17,Google Play,GrubHub,0,,4
The worst app. I received a coupon valid for 7 days and when I try to use the coupon within 7 says it didn't work and customer care gave lame excuse that the promo has ended. Though nowhere the coupon end date was mentioned.,2024-10-16 18:26:43,Google Play,GrubHub,0,,1

I use it NGL but........This app will order from a restaurant 20 miles away when the same restaurant is only 2 miles from me. So dumb. Wasting the drivers fuel and delivering cold food. Can't sort by what is open or limit the distance at all. Can't coordinate a simple 2 stop pick up without getting 2 separate drop off.

I had the worst experience with this app tonight. I ordered food from a restaurant on this app the driver ate some of my food. Left bite marks in the rest of what they ate and delivered the rest to me. They refunded me my money but said it was for a damaged order. I said damaged order my fanny.

Why is everything on this app so dang expensive compared to every other delivery app. I rarely use these things but I was on vacation so like why not I have prime the deal might be good...

Even with the free prime delivery deal it isn't worth doing.,2024-10-08 10:31:07,Google Play,GrubHub,7,,1
Let's just say hope you have your order actually delivered and/or no issues. Once you deal with customer service for this company it all goes downhill. Short update. Still do do. Drivers are lazy and don't deliver or will cancel your order for no reason. No quality control from GH either. The fix they use is giving credits or X number of days of the membership.

Since Prime took over the fees are now there all the time. The waived fee was just basically doubled with Prime but you'll get minimal discounts now.

I have found that the tips are not good enough. When you deliver to a customer's house The address is not no where to be found on the house or out by the road . I have 2 violations no big reason at all I think the staff just do it because they don't want you to have far try at delivering to someone s house I also I had the same problem with door dash staff and so now I'm just going to starting today I'm giving out bad reviews and ratings the staff got one Star ⭐ next time they better think,2024-09-24 13:39:56,Google Play,GrubHub,1,,1

"The GrubHub guarantee states that if your order is late, even by one minute, from the original stated delivery time, you get a $5-$7 perk to use on a future order. Sounds great but when you apply for the perk when they are late, which is often, the time they say your order would be delivered by is ALWAYS pushed back later than the original time promised.

Do not use them. They are consistently late. I've ordered from multiple restaurants that are not busy and only a mile away. I've also ordered during high and low traffic times. I live in a suburb in Florida. They pair your order with a lot of other orders from the same restaurants. The driver has to wait for not only your food but all the others. Their fees are ridiculous too. Consistently waiting an hour and a half is unacceptable. Stopping orders is extremely hard if not impossible.,2024-09-06 21:14:11,Google Play,GrubHub,23,,1

I do not recommend using this service. I ordered from Panda Express and I never received my drink. A $3 drink.

Placed 3 orders today. They misplaced the first order when Driver delivered the food at wrong address. Later 2nd order was cancelled by the same restaurant. Third order kept us waiting for 1.5 hours and got cancelled saying the restaurant is closed. Grubhub customer service is a joke. They told me after first order that this won't be repeated when it did repeat twice on the same day. 3 orders cancelled and they give $7 credit. Customer care kept suggesting to place order at different restaurants,2024-08-29 17:28:19,Google Play,GrubHub,1,,1
"Completely AWFUL awful experience . Ordered twice from GrubHub today since they gave me a coupon for the FIRST messed up order.

"I didn't get my food and I had to talk to 3 different people just to find out they canceled my order and let the driver keep the food. The driver saw I was at a library and apparently gave up, calling me once but I didn't see the call because it was marked as spam. The delivery time was also long, not just due to the fact that the driver couldn't find me even though I gave her the address specifically for the library.

"The reason why they get 2 stars is because there's some things that they should change.

Honestly sick of this apps drivers. 3 seperate occasions where my food doesn't show up. Have to show people how to open a simple gate.

Don't use this app! I placed an order from burger king. The app didn't keep my selections when it went through. My food came with the app default selections. It was also ice cold LITERALLY ICE COLD because they made it before the driver got there and put it on a shelf in a bag with no heat. The fries and hot food sat against the cold drinks waiting 20 minutes forthe driver to get there. Fail on burger king and grub hub! Do better y'all.,2024-08-15 20:01:28,Google Play,GrubHub,2,,1

Almost every single time I use Grubhub my driver/drivers can't follow SIMPLE directons and delivers my food TO THE WRONG STREET!! After this order gets redelivered I will not use this app again. Grubhub is entirely worse than Doordash and Uber Eats. You shouldn't just let anyone with a license and insurance deliver for you. Especially when they can follow simple directions.

"Be careful with ordering. Sometimes, the app will suggest a different location if it's a chain and your food will arrive late and cold.

"They now punish customers for a restaurant messing up orders. They will not give refunds if where you live messes up orders constantly.

Additional and surprise fees are outrageous. Grubhub barely complies with prop 22 and only because of enforced legislation.

Drivers will often accept a delivery and then go home to clock out or accept multiple deliveries at once which causes a new driver to accept the delivery and/or your food is cold by the time it gets to your house. I keep having terrible experiences with the drivers in this app and GrubHub doesn't fix or acknowledge the issue. Uninstalling and using Uber Eats from now on.

After an 8 hour drive I decided to use GrubHub to get food. Tried multiple times to order and it just keep saying error. So had to go find food in a new city where I know where nothing is at. Try again the next night same thing. So contact GrubHub. No explanation as to why I couldn't order but was basically told I couldn't order food from them. They then proceed to cancel my membership with them even though my membership is through Amazon. Uber eats had my food there in less time and cheaper.,2024-06-30 13:05:49,Google Play,GrubHub,0,,1

Gave a second shot because of Prime. Still the worst when it comes to drivers. Last two orders assigned to the same driver who was clearly doing multiple orders at once. 1st order picked up an hour after it was placed then taken on a 25 mile joyride 2 towns over before it was delivered ice cold. 2nd one driver was stationary for 40 minutes before finally picking up and delivering an hour after the initial estimate.

"Multiple times, I try to order something only to learn that the restaurant that I ordered from is 30 to 40 minutes away, sometimes more. This makes the delivery fee insane and the food is usually cold by the time I get it. If the restaurant says that they are making the food, there is no canceling the order. If I look at the pizza section, do not give me a pizza hut 30 minutes away when there is one only 2 minutes away. I shouldn't have to sort by distance every time.

*** missing feature technical issues. Fix: You keep removing the best feature! Normally after food is delivered you'd send a text asking how it was and if I'd like to increase the tip.

Why do you not provide proper refunds and take peoples money when your drivers do not check items properly and deliver the wrong items all the time or do not deliver some items and will not submit a refund when they know an item is missing?

There's never any deals unless you don't use it for months. I've been paying for grubhub plus unknowingly for some time now. These other apps offer way better deals. After you use some of grubhubs promo codes you can sometimes get just above what it cost you at the restaurant. Most of the time they charge you a 5-10 service fee for meals costing between 20- 65 dollars. It's percentage based which is ridiculous.

"The app is alright, but my biggest gripe is the fact if you aren't premium then you aren't a priority. Sometimes I'm waiting 40 minutes just to get a driver in peak day time hours. And if I get a driver, they will opt to drop off someone else's order further than me, passing my house to drop theirs off. And if they have someone in between you the app will not tell me they have a stop to make before mine like Uber Eats does...

"(Boston based experience) Grubhub drivers continually fail to follow the instructions and continually drive past where they are supposed to deliver food, turn onto a different street, and leave food in the wrong spot.

Love this app but for me the one big nice to have is a counterpart to the favorite restaurants a bad experience/avoid list. I live in a big city with hundreds of restaurants poping in and out of existence. I like to try each one at least once. But I have no way to keep track of ones I've had issues with other than writing them down on a naughty list. And have accidentally ordered from the same places twice as I don't always have the list on me. Please if you could add a feature like that. 👍,2024-04-30 20:19:49,Google Play,GrubHub,22,,4

"I have 2 delivery apps. I’ve been using Grubhub more recently until now. I rarely have an issue. And customer service was fair. Ordered from Jack In The Box. Received alert my order is on the way. No other deliveries delays. My driver stopped mid way. I texted them if everything was okay. No response. I clicked on request about delivery delay. My order arrived just before being considered late. Noticed my drink did not have seal. All other bags had seals. So I requested “help” again. The drink was the only issue. Customer support said I had an unusually high request for refunds, discounts, and requests and can only give me a $5 credit. Great. But the “unusually high requests, refunds” comment was not justified. I sent request to delete my account. I canceled Grubhub + membership.

But coming back home I see two separate orders and charged my account twice- first order with 2items and second order with same 2 items and addon item repeated. Customer support dint even help me with refund or care to create a “ticket” raising glitch concerns. If the glitch is with grubhub and restaurant delivers you wont get refund. Complete ridiculous instance with no help and refund being an elite member. When I have the confirmation on the app why will I go and check my email back and forth, that is ridiculous.

"I preorder in advance and later I received a call telling me they do not have idli, so I asked if they could do anything about it. They said they could not update the order and instead told me to cancel and reorder again. I told them that if I cancelled I would not reorder again, so if they could change it to something else I would be ok as long as the price was close, the employee was not helpful but in the end the proposal was accepted.

 This feature should be in the restaurant and other providers app so that they can cancel the product that is not on their menu and update the order price accordingly. This ruins preorder since later you can get an out of stock call and now you’re plans are changed, which happens but with an app and such a big infrastructure supporting it behind, an easy product update for the order with a click saves time and money to everyone involved. The restaurant does not loose the order, the user does not loose their time and grub gets another user engaged.

I know there are more steps involved than just allowing restaurants to change the orders but there must be a way.",2024-04-22 14:25:54,App Store,GrubHub,,,
"I’ve never written a review of an app before, but unfortunately, my experience with GrubHub has pushed me to.

I placed an order for food for a party with a local restaurant. While the wait time was more than an hour, that was no problem since we knew the place is popular and we had some snacks to tide us over.

The real problem came when, as the expected time for the delivery came and went, no order showed up. Checking my phone, after finding and reviewing my order history, I saw that the order had been canceled because of a driver issue. That wouldn’t have been a huge issue in general, but by the time I saw the cancelation, the restaurant was closed, and we had to start the whole process over again with another local spot.

If the app had just made it clear that the order had been canceled on their end that would have been fine, but the fact that I had to dig in the order history and that there was no indication that we shouldn’t be expecting our order to arrive is a huge UI issue that completely undermines the whole point of the app—convenience and predictability.

Very disappointed.",2024-04-27 02:20:37,App Store,GrubHub,,,
"I never thought to use Grubhub until I got a promotion from one of my credit cards for Grubhub+. This was around 2 years ago and it worked fine. Fast forward a few years and I get a similar promotion. Now, I've used Grubhub around five times in the past few months and NONE of the orders have been on time. Additionally, two of these orders never made it to me. I would watch my driver drive in circles in random parking lots, delaying my order by 15 minutes many many times before bringing it to support where they reluctantly cancelled my order and refunded initial payments. 

Long story short, Grubhub drivers are corrupt and slow and that always falls back on the customer. Would not recommend Grubhub to anyone. Please do not waste your money on this delivery option",2024-04-27 22:53:24,App Store,GrubHub,,,

I don’t make much money so naturally, I want a refund when I didn’t receive something I paid $40 for. $40 is nothing to a multimillion dollar company like them and they’d still rather argue me down and give me a fake apology for “the inconvenience” rather than giving me my money back and trying to keep a customer.

This happens three more times before finally a successful transfer happens. In the meantime the unwanted and unauthorized food gets delivered. They now say they can’t refund it because it has been delivered, and offer a store credit of less than the amount they charged me. Every single part of this was due to multiple errors on GrubHub’s part, but they could not have cared less about actually fixing the problem.

"Grubhub is so horrendous that in the future I will be using anything but it. I will also recommend my friends, family, and every person on this platform to avoid it. After a long day and exhausting couple of weeks, I decided to use a gift card and order a Grubhub sandwich. Despite having my address set, location on, and having ordered from this restaurant numerous times, for some reason Grubhub sent the order to the wrong restaurant that was over thirty minutes away. This restaurant was on the upper east side and would require me to take a bus AND a subway to get to. When I asked for my money back or to transfer the order, I was told that was impossible. This has happened before. And I’m not sure if their customer service has tanked, but I was kindly given a refund and apology. This time I got what seemed like an AI generated response and someone who cut me off and ended the chat early without answering my last question. It is alarming that Grubhub has not fixed its app nor does it care about its loyal customers. I will be looking to other ordering platforms or ordering from restaurants directly and cutting Grubhub out. I suggest others do the same until Grubhub is willing to put people over profits!!!!",2024-05-03 22:59:39,App Store,GrubHub,,,

with the way prices all over the country are just soaring you might as well get delivery cause its cheaper than shopping now, that was my plan for this afternoon after working from 3am-1pm cause I’m tired and didn’t want to cook.

"Despite providing delivery instructions in multiple languages in the app and texting these same directions to each driver, there was a 50/50 chance that my food would be delivered to the wrong address or not according to specifications. When customer service was notified that my order was not received, I was asked to I checked outside of the building for my order. This request is irresponsible and unsanitary since most of my delivery requests are to a very public building and the directions are to deliver to the main office. So, why would I look for my food outside let along risk my health and safety by eating food that could have been tampered with since it was left outside in an unsecured space? The customer service is horrible! In my opinion, I deserve a refund every time your driver does not follow directions.

But it’s hard to check my own rating history of a place dishes that I liked or didn’t like. And hard to save and highlight dishes that I love.

I used Grubhub for the first time three days ago and the driver threw my order on the front porch right in front of me and then started cursing about having to deliver an order 20 miles away right in front of me as he stormed away. My second order was for 3 people. $85 for two orders of nachos and a burrito (including delivery fees and tip). It took an hour (which was expected) and they forgot both orders of nachos. So 2 of the 3 people were starving. Then they refunded me $30 (the price of the two nacho orders). So with fees I ended up paying $50 for 1 burrito. I then had to call Grubhub to complain and they reluctantly refunded me the delivery fees and tip, after the chat function didn’t help at all. Worst food delivery experience I have ever had…by far.

This last time, the representative didn’t give me a chance to respond and somehow I managed to get the same rep when I reinitiated the chat which didn’t make a lick of difference because they don’t care to try to fix the issue. Most the drivers they employ are often heading to multiple random locations while their en-route to deliver your food.

They might have gotten better about this recently, but they’d issue refunds on items that were never delivered (often drink items like a soda or coffee or whatever) that were less the price you paid for and doesn’t account for taxes, service fee, etc. I’m surprised they’ve upped their rating on the App Store because they had gotten abysmal and appear to remain a poor service.

The driver even got a tip for NOT delivering my food to my home. Failure to refund the money I paid for a service they did not complete amounts to theft.

"My food usually arrives fine with little to no issues, however, the delivery times are RIDICULOUS compared to other delivery services. They’ll give you an initial estimate on delivery time, which’ll be about 40-50 minutes, but because they dispatch the order to drivers that are SOO far away from the restaurant, the delivery time almost always extends by at least 30-40 MORE minutes. Even if I get delivery in the same town, it takes a long time because they almost always send drivers from the next cities/counties over. While they do have a “Help” section for late deliveries, I don’t use it, because they take the ENTIRE tip from the drivers who have already done their jobs, to send out refunds. | The GPS/tracker also has moments where the driver seems to just sit in one spot for a prolonged period of time.

The restaurant said they wouldn’t make the food bc I told them I wanted to cancel and would wait for me to let them know. Grubhub doesn’t even have a number to call and when I used the chat to speak with an agent they said they couldn’t cancel the order because the merchant was already making the food. When I told them that the restaurant isn’t because I told them I wanted to cancel the order, they offered a discount on a next order that went from $5 to $10 within 3 minutes. 

What kind of business doesn’t allow people to cancel their orders, I tried to cancel within 5 minutes of placing the order because I realized it was the wrong card. A terrible experience and service I won’t be using again.",2024-06-14 01:33:18,App Store,GrubHub,,,

I then check to see where they’re going because maybe they’re dropping off a someone else’s order but then I get the notification that my order has been delivered. I check my info and I see that it completely changed my address because they apparently “don’t deliver to my address”, but why didn’t they tell me that early before I wasted my money!!!! I specifically typed in my address before ordering and there was no problem at all, it said it’d be like 30 mins so no worries, but no. I no longer am worried about my order or getting it back, I’m happy to give someone else a free meal but I want my money back before I cancel my subscription and delete Grubhub. There’s no where on the app to even report my problem!

Customer Service is simply disappointing. I do however like the new refund policy because dealing with the above and less than satisfactory customer service after you’ve spent $$60 on a pizza, wings, and the pre charge tip will make you lose it when you find your cold pizza and wings have been sitting on the floor of the apartment buildings foyer for the last 30 minutes.

I rarely have to tip with GrubHub because absolutely never is my one instruction followed. Customer service is wretched but since tipping is optional, and my instructions are clearly not followed, I am able to get my tip back, though nothing else is ever done about the consistent problem.

"Grubhub is better than most delivery apps, but it is still way more expensive than ordering directly from the restaurant. Most restaurants in my area add at least $1 to all menu items to compensate for grubhub’s fees. A meal that should only cost $12 usually ends up at $20 or more (that’s nearly double). It’s great if you are sick, short on time, or just plain lazy. 

Using Grubhub for food delivery on a regular basis is a luxury and reserved only for the wealthiest customers despite the fact that the app tells you you’re saving money with a membership (I “saved” more than $400 in the past 6 months!?). 

My market research indicates this industry only has a matter of time until it fails though since none of these companies have earned any profit and most restaurants feel reluctantly obligated to participate. Save yourself some money and time, get out of the house, and do the right thing by calling restaurants, using their individual apps, and visiting in person to double check that your order meets your standards before Grubhub gets involved (nothing is more dissatisfying than when a delivery driver forgets a part of your order).",2024-06-21 04:07:24,App Store,GrubHub,,,
How many times have I ordered from Grubhub and had a delinquent driver/carrier that stole my food or wasted my time? I lost count. Grubhub needs to make it harder to become a driver and punish those that have numerous red flags and complaints against them. Grubhub makes sure I get my refund but it’s the time wasted (while I get hungrier and angrier) waiting for food that is never gonna get here. I’ve had drivers that don’t want to take the ELEVATOR in my building when I’ve buzzed them in and need me to go down. I’ve had drivers who can’t pick up the phone when I need them and I’ve had drivers that go and hang out while they’re accepted my order… it’s exhausting and I’ve stopped using apps for food deliveries. Hopefully someone reads this and can agree.,2024-06-23 22:20:56,App Store,GrubHub,,,
"I say luck of the draw because it is. You need to be selective of your restaurant choice, as in a reputable one. I love Grubhub’s service and I use it quite frequently. When I have ordered in the past, the drivers would bring me incomplete orders. I finally said something to the driver who then referred me to the restaurant, who then referred me to Grubhub. Drivers are not allowed to check orders? It was a Grubhub order so you have to deal with them? It is difficult to navigate the third party site to lodge a complaint, which by then dinner had long passed. So really, it depends on the restaurant.  Also, I have discovered that some drivers will do two deliveries at once and it will push the time back.",2024-06-24 21:19:38,App Store,GrubHub,,,
"I have constantly given this app chances. I was a Grubhub+ member for years. And the drivers are not what they used to be. Flat out disrespectful, stealing food, delivering the food in a disgusting state, and not following any directions. Driver ratings are not enough. When they refuse to answer the phone, take pictures, or tell you to contact customer service on them and they do nothing about it it’s time to go. I’m wiping my hands clean of this app. Everything is too expensive for me to be paying what I am just to experience disappointment after disappointment. Membership is cancelled today. And if there’s something I need so bad I would rather waste my own time and gas and just get it myself. It only gets two stars because it’s not the restaurants fault Grubhub does not hold their drivers accountable. -10 out of 10. Will not use again.",2024-06-28 19:10:51,App Store,GrubHub,,,
"Unlike Door Dash where you can fix the pin location on the map if it’s off, you can’t with GrubHub. I’ve gotten cold food because that’s how long it took the driver to find me, I’ve had my food dropped off at the wrong location, I’ve had to go to customer service time and time again with no resolution. They emailed me 2 months ago (the last time I’d ordered was 6 months ago) saying the issue as resolved and they updated the pin location. I ordered today and when the order was confirmed, the pin location was still in the wrong spot. Tried to contact customer service and was told they’d escalate it… again. I told them to just cancel it and I’d go out and buy food somewhere else and they said they could not refund me but could give me a credit for what I paid to be used on a future order. I declined as I just wanted to be reimbursed for an order I likely would not get. It was escalated and I was told the same thing and offered a $15 credit, then a $30 credit, still insisting they couldn’t refund me.

This service is so incompetent and you can never get in touch with the drivers when the location is wrong so it’s useless. I’d give this 0 stars but the least I can give is 1 so 1 star.",2024-06-30 21:05:37,App Store,GrubHub,,,
"Ordered a $40 meal and left tip, only to have the food stolen by said driver. Malaki (driver) decided to take off with the food after submitting a picture of delivered food which was a blank photo. 

I specifically requested for the food to be handed to me in fear of stolen food and was even going to leave more tip if the driver was nice. Once their car was on my street, I asked my boyfriend to wait by the door so he can receive the food. As soon as it said the food was “delivered,” he looked out and there was nothing. 

This is extremely frustrating because I work in the food industry and know that the runt of this will likely fall on the restaurant I ordered from. Although I received a refund and it should be processed in 5 days, hence why I’m not leaving a 1 star,I am disheartened for the restaurant who had already made the food. I hope Malaki is not allowed to steal more food from customers and restaurants. Will not be using grub hub again.",2024-07-05 22:55:09,App Store,GrubHub,,,
"I ordered food and it said the estimated time for delivery was 2:50-3:10. I’m watching for a notification to see if he’s finishing up a delivery for someone else, and maybe that’s why he’s driving in the opposite direction across town. Nope, get a notification that my food has been delivered, along with a photo of a clearly homeless person on the side of the road. Last time I checked, an address for a house isn’t the same as on the side of the road. So I try to call said driver, no response. Luckily I’m getting a refund but this isn’t the first time that grubhub has either been over an hour late, forgotten drinks, and now is just handing out random peoples food to people on the side of the road. Maybe they should make their app more accessible, considering that it took me 15 minutes to get ahold of literally anyone to ask for a refund for food that I paid for; and maybe they should make sure their drivers for delivery are not going to steal food. Crazy how I’ve never had this problem with Uber eats though.",2024-07-06 21:05:04,App Store,GrubHub,,,
"I was signed up for a Grubhub Plus membership without knowing and was unable to get a full refund for the subscription fees. I hadn’t opened the Grubhub app in over a year, then noticed some stray transactions from on my card which I thought might mean a hacked account. I looked into it and I had been signed up for a paid Grubhub Plus account without my knowing, and did not even get a courtesy email to let me know I had been forcibly signed up. The customer service team was only able to provide one of two fees back as a refund, and dropped the chat before I could contest. UPDATE: I got charged for ANOTHER month of membership on the day that I reached out for a refund. They promised to refund me for the previous month and cancel the membership, but instead they pushed through the next month’s membership fee and refunded that. They were inflexible about their refund policy even though all of these charges are due to their carelessness. So now, I’m stuck paying two months of fees for a service that I never signed up for. Really disappointed in this service. Will be ordering from DoorDash next time!",2024-07-09 17:08:31,App Store,GrubHub,,,
I made a simple order and ended up driving to the restaurant for the missing items and by the time I got home everything was cold and I just wasn’t hungry anymore. I called customer service and they wanted to give me $5 and a 10% off my next order 😂 like that’s supposed to make me wanna order using this app. They offered me 5% off my next order initially and I just thought that was hilarious. The customer service agent even agreed but he wasn’t allowed to do more. Which I get… but people pay more for the food in general and then get slapped with fees and tipping just to have a cold meal with missing items and for you to have the audacity to not offer a full refund or even half a refund 😂. I can’t make this stuff up. Thanks for your horrible policies and lack of logic I guess. I paid $30 for a laugh I didn’t think I needed.,2024-07-13 04:19:47,App Store,GrubHub,,,
I’ve ordered a couple of times to Grubhub and the service is very unprofessional. I have had two times that have ruined my experience with this app. The first instance was with my delivery driver. Everything was going well I got a picture from the driver sending me a picture of him holding my meal and drink but when I went to grab my meal I realized he took my drink which was unbelievable! I asked for customer service but I never got a response back from that. Later on today I decided to order again. I ordered two hours before a store closed and the status of my order showed “being prepared” for those two hours. I finally had to contact someone for them to give me a refund. It’s just very unorganized and disappointing.,2024-07-17 06:17:24,App Store,GrubHub,,,
"From Gryo King. I called the food chain multiple times and received no answer. When I decided to contact Grubhub customer service, the representative assumed I wanted a refund then proceeded to lie and claim I received a number of unusual refunds even though I JUST started using this app this month (July 2024) and only had an issue with ONE food place. THAT problem was the hurricane occurred and I placed an order while power was still out in certain places and they were actually closed (even though Grubhub claimed the place was open) so they gave me my money back. THAT was the only refund I’ve received out of 2 other food places I’ve ordered from

After getting no help from Grubhub Customer Service, I called Gyro King back and the owner or worker claimed they would fix my order but never did. I will never order from Grubhub or Gryo king again. This is exactly why UberEats is better",2024-07-21 23:24:20,App Store,GrubHub,,,
"In exchange for my inconvenience they offered free trial membership to a service that couldn’t deliver a simple meal.

The long story…
Address in the app was wrong so I chatted with Desmond to see if I can change it and let the driver know to deliver it to the correct address.  He said he contacted the driver and all was good.  App said the food was delivered but there was nothing on my doorstep when I went to look for the food.  Texted Michelle and she said she went to the wrong address and couldn’t take a picture at the house she delivered the food.  Chatted with the GH help desk and they had to cancel my order and issue GH credit so I had to re-order my food.  So here I sit waiting another 45 minutes for them to, hopefully, deliver dinner for my family…. I’ve never seen such incompetence.",2024-07-22 01:16:01,App Store,GrubHub,,,
"The app lets you give feedback to the restaurant and to the driver who delivers your food. It does not allow you to give feedback to the driver who accepted to deliver your order and decided to skip out on it, nor does it allow you to give feedback to corporate for their handling of their drivers’ failures. And unfortunately, this sort of thing happens about 10% of the time, with no way to address the problem other than to deal with the problem other than to accept a $5 coupon for a two hour delay on the stone cold food that a responsible driver finally delivers.",2024-07-22 06:06:08,App Store,GrubHub,,,
"No food delivery app is perfect. After all, someone outside of the app is physically doing the driving and caring for your meal. Like with any other app, you will have some amazing drivers and you will unfortunately have some who are terrible or clearly do not care. When you have to deal with the crappy driver experiences, I feel that GH does a pretty good job with customer service. 
I have always been 100% refunded for a meal that never made it to my home. The competitor UE has never reimbursed me for a full meal. GH will give discounts off of future meals for other subpar driving experiences like food arriving late.
I miss the 1 time per month $10 off any pickup order deal GH had. But, GH’s customer service is easy and reliable. And they do a great job at refunding when it is necessary.",2024-07-22 18:01:17,App Store,GrubHub,,,
"I signed up after not having it for two years so that I could send my best friend breakfast on her birthday. They delivered the wrong order from the wrong company. When I complained, they didn’t give me a problem about refunding it and I said I didn’t want to refund. I wanted them to resend the items, the help us person said that they could not resend it but since I got the refund, I could go ahead and place a new order. The new order was placed and delivered, and when my friend went out to grab her food, the driver spilt her drink all over her sandwich. I provided a picture of the spilled drink showing the liquid on the floor as well as the soggy sandwich and the unopened straw, and they still would not refund my money. So I called and spoke to someone in customer service. She claimed to be the supervisor and they would not give me a reason as to why they would not refund this order. I’m definitely canceling my membership and I will never order from them again.",2024-07-23 15:12:13,App Store,GrubHub,,,
"Now that GrubHub is legally forced to pay drivers more (GOOD), they are charging restaurants more fees, and in turn, restaurants are charging ridiculous ""service fees"" to make up for it! (Click the info icon next to the charge next time you see one) One of my formerly favorite restaurants now charges an $8 fee on top of everything, plus delivering fee! And of course I need to tip on top of that, because I can't trust how much money is actually going to drivers.

I'm going to start ordering directly again, and using GrubHub as a digital menu only. If you want your neighborhood to thrive, I encourage you to do the same. This used to be a company that added convenience and helped people discover hidden gems. Now it's predatory to customers and business owners alike.

I'm done with GrubHub.",2024-07-27 00:34:19,App Store,GrubHub,,,
"I was fine with the small mistakes here and there especially when they refunded me. In the morning I ordered breakfast, which after waiting for an hour and a half with no courier I got connected to customer service to cancel the order and get a refund and $5. Whatever, at least I got my money back, no harm, no fowl. I ordered dinner later that day, received two of the three items I ordered, and had to contact customer service again, only to be treated as if I was lying to them. Excuse me? Get your service fixed and then you wouldn’t have these issues with refund requests. I wasn’t only ordering for myself, one of us just didn’t get their food. The least they could have done was give me a refund but all they would do is give me some pre scripted automated message denying a refund. Pathetic and insulting. I’ve already requested to delete my account and I’ve uninstalled the app, they’ve permanently lost me as a customer after such an insulting response.",2024-07-27 23:10:23,App Store,GrubHub,,,
"Time after time when ordering through Grubhub I have to watch as the given delivery window is constantly pushed back on avg 2 hrs past when the food was expected to arrive and no update or information is provided to me until after this time has elapsed. And waiting 2 hrs for what should have been 20-30 minutes is a best case scenario. I’ve lost faith in the app due to the fact most orders are just flat out cancelled now after waiting hours, still no info or reason. Just a “We’re sorry but we cancelled your order and you might get your refund in a week from now” message. No attempt at making up for the error that is on the pickup/delivery side. No credit, no coupons, no guarantee that the next time you use the service the problem will be fixed. And yeah I called the places I was ordering from and they all state the order was cancelled from Grubhub’s side. At this point it’s not that Grubhub isn’t worth the hassle; it actually is causing more problems than a delivery app claims to fix. Just completely disappointed. This is my money, food, and time that’s being disrespected and it’s disgusting that things like this aren’t being taken care of.",2024-07-28 09:53:01,App Store,GrubHub,,,

Little do I know, grub hub contacts my card to not only continue the premium on my card, but also recharges the original amount days later. I sporadically go through this process every 6months to a year when I randomly notice this. Canceling my card, and charges reappearing. I even contacted grubhub to have them stop reoccurring charges. Still was charged for 10 months after this. Finally got my card to stop all future payments ever with grubhub. terrible customer service, goes around me to contact visa to get my card info (when they’re the fraudulent charge!), and doesn’t cancel the reoccurring charge when requested.",2024-08-01 03:02:15,App Store,GrubHub,,,
"I canceled my Grubhub+ membership last night. Unfortunately, Grubhub won’t notice my cancellation until the annual membership expires November 2024. I’ll use the app until then. Starting December 2024, I’ll choose a different food delivery app to use. Grubhub does not work in Vermont. It works well in California, Alaska, Minnesota, and likely countless other states. However, I’m cancelling my membership and deleting the app because of my experience in Vermont. Grubhub does absolutely nothing when I watch the delivery driver pick up my food, then purposefully bleed the clock until the order is late. Or, it takes the app 45 min to an hour to find a driver to pick up and deliver the order, thereby rendering the food cold upon delivery. In both scenarios, I was offered a $5 coupon on a future order. Yes, I got my food. Was happy to pay for that food. But I would’ve eaten hot food had I acted as my own delivery driver. So tell me, why deal with this app? I’m sorry Grubhub+, but I don’t need you. Thank you for inspiring me to quit your app. It’ll save me stress. This review is not reflective of the app’s performance. Grubhub has a good app. It’s just the people behind the machine that should be aware they are driving customers away.",2024-08-01 09:49:58,App Store,GrubHub,,,
"Customer service is horrible they fault you for be a high usage customer. I was told they can’t give me any more refunds, for the order I paid that was messed up. Mind you I have only gotten 5 refunds and I use Grubhub about 5-6 times a week in the last 5-6 months. So naturally if you already have high complaints about orders not being right. I’m gone to have a higher amount order that’s mess up, then average. Especially when the restaurant or driver don’t pay attention to who’s food they are handling.

That not the bad part. When you try to tell that to consumers service they say its nothing they can to and there is no one above them I can talk to. I expressed my concern then the supervisor disconnected the chat In the middle of me typing and that happened twice. So I called the customer service number and guess what I got the exact rude response. That I can’t be refunded for paying for something I never got, and That she’s the supervisor there’s no manager she has a boss but can’t direct him to me and can’t give here last name or ID number. But say “my first name is Denise,”

I then try to text him to let him know he delivered the wrong order and I get no response. An hour later I get a text message saying my order has been delivered and a link to see the picture of the delivery. Yeah, the picture was the front of my house taken from the street.

I have contacted Corporate still nothing I don’t even have account with Grub-hub and I’m still being charged for this Grub-hub membership.

I’ve spent over 15k with Grubhub on food. It’s my main place to eat. Unfortunately I’ve had to stop today, because literally every other time now the driver shows up to the wrong address. The way the app parses the address when the driver uses Apple Maps vs Google maps is different, and I can’t fix it from within the app (since it’s not my address which is wrong, it’s the app). I called and messaged customer service likely for over 4 hours in total to fix this. The last time I called was the nail in the coffin — driver showed up to the wrong address, delivered the order (40 minutes) had to reorder, reorder shows up as going to the wrong place AGAIN, call customer service to tell them to fix it, they say they fix it after 20 minutes, I go to the order page and see it’s STILL wrong, I had to call the driver to fix it.

This is by far the worst delivery app available on the market the orders never show up on time they are always incorrect and the customer service policy’s they have are absolute garbage they really need to take in account that without customers there app is NOTHING but a space save yourself the issues and stick with DoorDash or Uber eats they will give u 1 singular refund or “coupon” and then they will tell u after that there is nothing they can do because of a “suspicious amount of reimbursements” I used this app on a business trip because it was provided by the hotel I stayed at with free delivery and ended up PAYING to use DoorDash instead because this app is so garbage just do yourself the favor and don’t download this junk app they don’t deserve a customer base if they aren’t going to take care of the issues at hand,2024-08-15 02:20:02,App Store,GrubHub,,,

This is a basic basic requirement for people who are using your app completely unreliable, reliable or unreasonable for people to call or chat customer service for making changes to an order and you will only do a gift refund and not a full refund on the credit card.

"Apparently the representatives can’t unassign or reassign orders. Recently placed an order, order was assigned to the driver, driver got about halfway to the restaurant then turned around. They drove back to their home I’m assuming and stopped. For over an hour. Contacted the driver, said they didn’t have the order. Reps said the order was being remade and would be at my house in 11 minutes. Went back and watched the driver, who was way more than 11 minutes from my house, once again not move. Contacted the driver again, they told me they logged off and weren’t delivering anymore. Reps said they would reach out again, order was being remade, and it would get to me in 20 minutes…Ended up canceling the order because it was clear I was in a loop. Grubhub reps need the ability to reassign orders! And I was only offered 5 dollars off for the order being over 2 hours late. Giving Uber eats another try.

"I placed an order from Denny’s and never received it. The driver delivered it to the wrong address  and sent me a photograph, of what was supposed to be my place. I called customer service and they told me that they would resubmit the order and apologize for the inconvenience. 20 minutes later I got a callback saying they had to cancel the order and I would have to wait three days for my money. They said Denny’s wouldn’t make the order and they weren’t sure why. I called Denny’s and they refused to make it until it was paid for. So I had to go pay and pick it up myself. 
The whole ordeal was extremely frustrating! GrubHub should have an account in place so they can pay for their screw ups so the customer doesn’t have to suffer. The idea behind GrubHub is to be a convenience and it was nothing but a hassle! To add insult to injury, they sent me an email with a $7 off coupon… That was a slap in the face and just burned me even more. If that’s how you repay your customers then it’s a joke GrubHub! Furthermore, I was checking into other peoples comments and instead of replying “we’re sorry for the inconvenience please reach out to us” you should be reaching out to your customers the next day because you have all our information and you have the complaint and you should be contacting us to make it right!",2024-08-19 19:03:49,App Store,GrubHub,,,

After that, another 45 minutes. I called the restaurant and they said the food has been sitting there waiting for almost 2 hours and no one has ever shown up to get it.

I said don’t bother, I won’t be ordering again. They increase the amount after that. I said I just want the order canceled and my money refunded. Then I have to find another way to get food. It’s just way too much trouble to get something to eat.  Yes I could just drive somewhere to get food, but I travel for work and don’t really know the areas I’m staying.

The amount of times I’ve gotten home from a long shift at work excited to have dinner delivered to my door only to have nothing delivered at all is honestly embarrassing. I gave the app another chance today thinking that they may have improved with time. I was greatly mistaken. 

I finally, FINALLY, learned my lesson. Please save yourself and learn from my mistakes. Just get DoorDash. I know grub hub+ is free with Prime but even that’s not worth it.",2024-08-31 01:42:18,App Store,GrubHub,,,
"It’s hard to understand how companies like DoorDash and Uber eats seem to do a seamless job while GrubHub, at least in my area, has failed almost every time I used them. First attempt was delivered to my neighbors despite clearly mark addresses on the mailbox. Another, after paying for expedited delivery, missed the first delivery window and then Missed the second delivery window. Chat customer service was useless and offered $5 and to wait for it to be delivered, which was now an hour late. I contacted Phone customer service and was
Told that a driver had not been assigned and there was no ETA. After canceling the order I drove to restaurant and learned that the restaurant actually loses out on payment even though it’s clearly a Grubhub error. Account cancelled and App deleted.",2024-08-31 21:16:01,App Store,GrubHub,,,
The customer support representatives were unhelpful and I also believe gave false information. It seems this is standard practice for grubhub. The delivery driver asked my daughter for the confirmation number via text. My daughter gave them the number. Then directly went to go grab food. Looked all over. Texted driver. No reply. Called driver. No answer. Repeated these steps. Multiple times. Many people called customer service and talked through the events. Many people went on the online chat and talked through the events. No Grubhub help or refund was forthcoming. I don’t really understand the reasoning behind saying that because a number was given they can not refund the money. If food is not delivered should constitute a refund. Not whether or not a driver can convince someone unknowingly to send a number. 🤷🏻‍♂️.,2024-09-02 08:13:31,App Store,GrubHub,,,
"Poor customer service, they try everything to weasel out of their obligations and promos. They will deny refunds if you encounter a problem with your order. Falsely accuse you of already having an account when signing up for the first time. Outrageous fees and they will try to lure you to buy their plus subscription service under the guys of free delivery fees, but it’s really not free. There’s an order minimums of $12 plus to get free delivery, but then they still charge a service fee which is jacked up high and the same as the normal delivery fee so in reality you’re still paying a delivery fee even though you promised zero dollar delivery fees. The whole app is a scam. If you select pick up vs delivery you will notice huge price differences. Insane mark ups. It’s better to just order directly with the restaurant and use the restaurant app if they have one. Stay away from Grubhub",2024-09-02 19:35:02,App Store,GrubHub,,,
"I had high hopes for Grubhub, but my experiences have been nothing short of frustrating. The app consistently delays delivery times, leaving me waiting far longer than estimated. When I try to reach out to the drivers via text or call, they often don’t respond, which adds to the anxiety of wondering where my food is. 3 blocks down at a house that doesn’t look like mine saying foods been delivered. So frustrating!!!

To make matters worse, the customer service is a nightmare. When I finally manage to get in touch with them, they seem more focused on making excuses than actually resolving the issues. It feels like they go out of their way to complicate things rather than help. Overall, my experience with Grubhub has been disappointing, and I would not recommend it to anyone looking for a reliable food delivery service.",2024-09-07 20:33:30,App Store,GrubHub,,,
"The worst delivery app! I would not recommend this app to anyone! I have had experiences both as a restaurant owner and as a costumer and both are HORRIBLE experiences, as a costumer, I decided to order a hamburger with fries and a medium soda, cost 19 dollars, what was my surprise that at the time of charging it was 35 dollars! When I checked the receipt on the app I saw that they had charged me 6.99 for shipping 2.89 for taxes, and extra 1.89 for ""service fees"" and yet they had the nerve to charge $5.00 as a ""driver fee"" when I never left a tip. And even with the almost 7 dollars I paid for shipping my order took over an hour to be delivered.
As the owner it took me 2 months to receive the money my business earned, I called customer service thousands of times and they just gave me excuse after excuse, it wasn't until I started to push with suing that they gave me my money AND IT WASN'T EVEN THE FULL AMOUNT! The drivers are mostly rude and pushy, they are always late, when the order has gone cold, and the app never notifies me of anything, not even when the driver arrives. They also have a terrible costumer service with people that don’t even talk a proper English and are imposible to understand.",2024-09-13 01:33:00,App Store,GrubHub,,,
"Every now and then, I receive a message from StubHub that my order from the Breakfast Shoppe has been received, is being prepared, is on it’s way, has arrived, and finally received a photo from the driver, confirming that it’s here.  This would be excellent customer service IF I HAD EVER ORDERED ANY FOOD FROM STUB HUB OR THE BREAKFAST SHOPPE, but I haven’t!!  😡

The first several times, I thought it was a funny and would even get a little hungry, wondering how good the food is from the Breakfast Shoppe (wherever that is.). I would politely return messages stating that the driver is using the wrong phone number and to contact whoever actually ordered this meal. 

Yesterday, and again this morning, I am once again receiving messages messages that “my order from the Breakfast Shoppe is on it’s way.”  I don’t know how my phone number became the favorite default choice for Stub Hub drivers, but I would like it to stop please.  It’s no so funny anymore.",2024-09-13 13:36:42,App Store,GrubHub,,,
"So the app itself is pretty great. The issue I have is with the quality of drivers. There's a reason why I leave special instructions especially when it comes to drivers and the call box. I stopped paying for a Grubhub membership because I got sick and tired of leaving instructions specific instructions especially with regard to drivers and how they use the call box. The problem is is that they don't use the call box and they just drop my food wherever they feel like dropping it and there's no way to get a hold of the drivers. The drivers are lousy and careless and reckless in my area. It's a real shame because GrubHub is the cheapest of all of the food delivery apps and gives you the most perks for your membership. Until GrubHub goes back to the way things used to be where drivers actually listen to and read and follow instructions I will not justify paying for a membership. I put special instructions in the delivery notes for a reason. I don't write stuff down for my health, I make it easy as much as possible for drivers to find my location especially given the fact that I'm blind and I don't want anyone stealing my food. Overall the app is great but GrubHub needs to do some serious quality control.",2024-09-15 09:25:58,App Store,GrubHub,,,
"Grubhub consistently has delivery issues, where DoorDash does just fine. Just did an order and opted to add another stop. Both locations are within eyesight of each other. They split the order to two drivers, gave the first driver an address range so he dropped it at down the street. Walked through the rain to retrieve it. The address in my account is correct, they just chose to ignore it. When I went to bring it to the attention of Grubhub so the other driver wouldn’t randomly select a house to deliver to, they said they couldn’t change my address and I should be more careful about the details, and cancelled the order (I checked my account address after the CSR closed the chat on me without an opportunity to respond). Just use DoorDash.",2024-09-17 23:34:44,App Store,GrubHub,,,
"I’ve used Grub Hub about 20 times now and I like having choices. Recently however I have had a couple problems with the items delivered. Once it was the completely wrong order. I believe the driver gave me someone else’s order. And unfortunately I didn’t open it up for at least an hour after it arrived. Grub hub refunded me. But I wanted what I wanted and was disappointed. A 2nd time I ordered a sandwich And 3 drinks. I didn’t meet them at the door because of Covid but went and got it a few minutes after the delivery person left. It was immediately obvious something was wrong. This time my sandwich, but no drinks! I contacted grub hub and they reimbursed me for the missing items. Again ok, but I really wanted the drinks. Last was probably the restaurant but I’d like to think grub hub would notice and at least encourage the restaurant to call me. I ordered a lemon cake and I got sent a Carmel desert. They might have been out of the lemon cake. Just call! Ask me what I want instead. I don’t like Carmel. So it was again a disappointment. I’m hoping the GH delivery folks are taught to look at the order and compare it to what the restaurant gives them. I hope they have an item count. 4 thinks ordered 4 things delivered. These would make small errors go away and would make quality much better.",2024-09-21 00:06:31,App Store,GrubHub,,,
"There have been times I literally put the food into the customer hands, took a picture of them holding it, than right after I drive away the order gets cancelled! Happens with 1 in every 20 or so customers. Even with all of the positive deliveries, they still deactivated me. Most of my customers leave tips after the delivery has been made. GrubHub never even once reached out to me or looked at the delivery photos before allowing the customer to cancel so easily in the app with the touch of a button! It’s not fair, I literally drive 7 days per week and depending on this to feed my family between jobs. My account was randomly deactivated while I was standing inside of a restaurant waiting for an order! I had just text the customer to let them know I would be arriving shortly. GrubHub never speaks to its drivers to see where the order was left or if it was actually handed to the customer. Now I have to go back and forth with GrubHub Support via. Email which takes 24-48 hours for each reply they send. It’s really not fair and I wish there was more I could do about this!",2024-09-21 17:11:20,App Store,GrubHub,,,
"I’m not giving a one star because i understand sometimes maybe drivers are busy. Though it’s insane that every single order I have ever made is always delayed by at least an hour. My original estimate tends to b 40 minutes to an hour, which is still bad since I’ll order from places close by. I live in Hawaii so the island is relatively small and sometimes the places I order from are 10 minutes away. The original estimate is not the best, but then my orders always get delayed and the times change. It’ll go to 10 minutes later, and sometimes an hour later than the original estimate. Sometimes it will even delay more than once without any reason given. Half the time my order is already melted or cold because of this. They should give some points or money back every time it’s delayed. It’s starting to get ridiculous.",2024-09-24 05:25:23,App Store,GrubHub,,,
"I ordered from them today and ended up not receiving my order meaning the person driving delivered it to the wrong place despite me putting in the correct address. I tried multiple times to receive a refund and they kept saying that they are not able to give me one despite me not receiving MY WHOLE ENTIRE ORDER which is absolutely ridiculous. They reasoned it by invalid excuses such as saying i have had issues happen before with the account i was using, which is clearly false because i downloaded the app right before placing the order and have not ever had a previous account with them. I want my refund!! - nyaa simone If you want a guarantee that you will be compensated if your order is wrong do not order from this app! They’re workers are extremely unprofessional and don’t know how to handle any issues except for sticking to the script that is given to them to say when problems like this occur. They have no sympathy nor desire to actually solve your problems. not to mention you will have to wait a ridiculous amount of time for an order that you don’t even know if you will even receive due to their drivers laziness and lack of ability to pay attention to where they are delivering to. I seen that they recently did an update yesterday and all that i can notice that’s different is now they don’t give refunds at all no matter what is wrong with your order!! RIDICULOUS!! what type of improvement was that!!!",2024-09-25 03:15:24,App Store,GrubHub,,,
"I was at my daughters girls hockey game and ordered subs from Primos, which was 1.5 miles away. I chose the quickest pick up for $3 extra, order said delivery would be delivered in around 45 minutes. I kept washing the app and I saw that it was never picked up. So after an hour, I called the restaurant and they said yeah your order has been sitting here. I went on the chat and complained. Eventually I had to leave and go pick up the order myself only to have the driver say they were on their way an hour and a half after I ordered it. They credited me five dollars. I ended up paying extra for speedy delivery, seven dollars service fee from GrubHub for the order and paying for a tip to a driver that never actually picked my food up! Terrible customer service!! I deleted the app and I will never use them again.",2024-09-27 15:17:57,App Store,GrubHub,,,
"The only thing you can count on this app delivering reliably is disappointment and frustration. 

The last 3 times I used this app their drivers picked took my order from nearby (within a mile or 2 from my house) and drove them 30 minutes in the opposite direction. 2 of those times we ordered frozen desserts that melted completely. The hot food wasn’t even good anymore by the time it arrived. We even paid extra for the priority delivery one of the times and it made no difference whatsoever. When you complain about the order, after they’ve already ruined your night, their customer service leaves you fairly certain nobody cares about the issues and nothing is being done to correct them. All this while the cost of using the app increases exponentially.",2024-09-28 22:32:59,App Store,GrubHub,,,
"Had a driver who had a different profile pic that didn’t match his gender or face. The profile pic showed a girl in her 20’s but the driver was a middle-aged man. I naturally had a difficult time trying to find the driver. Also, the driver did not call me even though he was lost for 10 minutes near my apartment complex. I suspect that he did not want his identity revealed. He also took a picture of me instead of the food. I immediately alerted Grubhub customer service  of the potentially dangerous situation, but they only gave me $5. They also said they would escalate the issue and contact me back, but I haven’t heard from them after around two weeks. Honestly, money was the least of my concern, but rather the safety of Grubhub customers. Terrible, terrible service",2024-10-01 19:55:53,App Store,GrubHub,,,

Yesterday a very nice woman delivered my food from L&L Hawaiian BBQ. I opened up the bag and it was another persons order. I paid around $30 for my food and the food I received was about $17. I contacted the driver because I understood that it was just a simple mistake that could happen to anyone who just delivered food to 4 different people from the same restaurant in under 30mins and I didn’t want to contact Grubhub and get her in trouble. So while i was talking to her on the phone she said she felt so bad that she ruined my dinner and that she was gonna call Grubhub and right this wrong.

They wouldn’t refund me so they applied credit to my account(great except I don’t want credit), I called the customer service number, they said they’d process a refund, checked my account 10/3, no refund yet, called tonight (10/4), just 32 hrs after calling last, they see a refund was supposed to be issued but didn’t process it and wouldn’t process one because according to them I was more than 48hrs.

I told her that and she was being rude about it and says will disconnect me. She was being extremely rude and refusing to help me. I then talk to another person after a moment name AL- Joanne LMF which she also refuse to give me refund to it as saying status did not change.

"It’s 1am and GrubHub just cancelled my 2nd order in a row TONIGHT, and my 3rd in two weeks.  The second order was literally on its way to my house when they cancelled it. Their customer service department called and said THE DRIVER DIDN’T REALIZE MY HOUSE WAS SO FAR so they just let him keep my dinner, I guess?  Customer service also suggested maybe I have my own address wrong? (Don’t worry, I checked, and yep— same address they’ve been delivering to for five years now). 
Before they cancelled my first order I called the restaurant directly, twice, and was told they gave the food to the driver, but he was too slow, so they sent it out again, and it never reached me. 
It’s now 1am, no place left open to order from. My once-a-week treat to myself is cancelled, AGAIN! by GrubHub.

I recently had an issue where the driver delivered my order to the wrong location and I couldn’t get in touch with them. Also had an issue where I wanted to cancel an order but couldn’t do so from the app; I had to get in touch with customer service to cancel. I also wish we could rate the drivers.

I was misled to thinking that for 30 days I will get no delivery fees and no general fees don’t give me wrong. I know you for business but the extra dollars just so I can get a drink still charged a bunch of money so I’m not asking you to do anything for your company.

I contacted customer service and they issued a “credit” as if I’d ever want to use this app again. I asked if the driver would receive consequences, and the customer service rep rushed me off the chat. Also, they cancelled my order so I can’t see the driver’s name or information. The order was not a cancellation, it was a no delivery. I don’t think she ever even came down my street. She sent a bogus picture that was just a black image. These apps need to be regulated.

I’m dog sitting and I’ve had the worst luck when it came to food whether the dogs eating the food or there’s not really much here. So I was just excited to finally have some chipotles.

I’m sure some automated system will eventually respond to this with the customer service phone number which is an absolute joke. 

I understand that mistakes happen (like watching the driver go in the completely opposite direction for 30 minutes until they reassign the order to a new driver who did the same thing and finally reassign it to a driver who actually goes to the restaurant only it’s closed by that time… which has happened to me on more than one occasion) but when they happen multiple times and there’s no effort by the company to proactively make it up to loyal customers that’s when they lose those customers. 

I’ve been a plus member for a long time but I’ll be cancelling my account and switching to one of the many other delivery options available.

I talked to 5 different people every time I called they said they were the supervisor different name they would not listen to me they all just said there is nothing they could do because my status had not changed which they would not explain. I just made my plus account. No matter what I asked or said everyone of them would just interrupt me and say since there was no other issue at this moment they were disconnecting. I told them please do not I still have an issue but every last one said the same thing and without ever offering any help just hung up on me. The chat is exactly the same. They are scamming people out of their money. And taking no responsibility for horrible service. They will not listen to you or even answer a question.

I have used them for a while now because I thought they were cheaper than the other services and they aren’t. They take WAY longer than the other places and their customer service is horrible in the app. If you have an issue just call the customer service number. And they have only ever gotten my order correct three times. This latest time the driver blamed the store and the store said the driver only grabbed one bag and rushed out. Another time I had a driver yell at me on the phone and then stand on my porch with my food til I came out to get it even though I stated it was a contactless delivery. so unprofessional I have no idea where they find these crappy drivers.

"The time estimates for how long your order will take are almost always off by around 45 minutes. Using the app is pretty much not worth it anymore. Even if your order is ready at the restaurant on time, it will still be around 30 minutes late because (it looks like) the drivers drop off 3 other people’s orders between picking up your food and giving it to you. This is completely ridiculous, as not only does it add at least 30 minutes to your delivery time, but your food will always be cold by the time it gets to you. The charge for delivery is not worth it by any means. You have the option of “priority delivery” for an extra charge of course 🙄 which just means “if you give us 5 more dollars, we’ll deliver when we said we would.” At this point the only effective way to use the app is to place a pickup order, which you could just do on the restaurant’s website for cheaper, making the app obsolete.",2024-11-12 23:54:54,App Store,GrubHub,,,

"This isn’t a bad app at all and this it might just be the area I’m in but there have been multiple times that my order has been canceled and there was such a late delay or the drivers could not understand how to get to my dorm on a college campus when I gave the proper address and more than enough extra directions. Then when I use DoorDash I get better text updates, better success rate on drivers, and no delays with cancellations. For example my last order was from Coldstone and the estimated delivery time was 11:30 which was over an hour after they closed then eventually they canceled. I then ordered from DoorDash and it came quickly and perfectly fine. Although I use Grubhub for the places to eat around campus and it’s pretty good.",2024-11-18 04:07:53,App Store,GrubHub,,,
"I don’t know what it is about GrubHub but the app is constantly glitching so I never know the true status of my order. So every order I place, I have to reach out to customer service for help. And I don’t know if it’s the area that I live in, but there is almost never any drivers available when I place an order. So I typically find myself waiting over an hour to two hours for my food. And when I reach out to customer service asking can I just cancel, they tell me I cannot cancel my order because the restaurant has started to prepare it but who wants food that has been sitting for two hours? The only reason why I use GrubHub is because the company I work for gives us credits for orders. But I’m honestly at a point where I would not recommend this app to anyone.",2024-11-18 16:55:40,App Store,GrubHub,,,
"I have been using different food delivery apps, this one is the worst regarding to customer service and no guarantee of food delivery. I ordered 4 orders in 2 days. One shows the restaurant was shown open on the app but restaurant was closed actually, the order status was just stayed at ‘food in work’ for over one hour until I reached to customer service; one order that the app shows the restaurant was open, and it showed the food is at work for over 30 mins until I called the restaurant who says the food is picked up already and in the process of being delivered, and the status showed order was at work for the whole night; one order shows the order was picked up after around 30 mins but the driver never picked it up and it was delayed and delayed until it was canceled by the app for me, I waited over 1.5 hours; the last order was a reorder from my last unsuccessful order, same thing happened, I called the restaurant who said the food is ready, but the assigned driver never picked it up, and the status stayed at ‘food at work’. I communicated with the customer service and expressed my frustration, and the chat was just ended from the customer side without addressing solutions whatsoever.",2024-11-20 03:27:35,App Store,GrubHub,,,
"WHERE are the instructions located on the driver app? Do you offer an auto translation option for the instructions? PLS it’s so annoying that the instructions are almost always ignored. I have chronic conditions that make movement hard and if I’m ordering delivery it’s because I’m having a bad day. 

I understand a driver not following insane instructions but my instructions are there because I have two gates in my apartment complex and the codes are different. I also provide instructions on where to park so they don’t have to fight for parking on my block. I’m just trying to make both our lives easier and it seems like nobody ever looks at the instructions. Then I have to go hunt for my food outside the gate before it gets stolen or I have to talk on the phone with a stranger who sometimes doesn’t speak English. 

My area is very multicultural so I wonder if there’s a language barrier within the app. I have two requests: please make it mandatory to at least LOOK at the instructions AND also offer a translation button so people who only read chinese/spanish/etc can deliver my food to my doorstep.",2024-11-24 20:59:27,App Store,GrubHub,,,
"The app is great and has a lot of options, and when something goes wrong Grubhub will usually fix/refund it pretty quickly on their end. But 7/10 times these is a problem with my order somehow. Either the restaurant screwed the order up, or there is an issue with the driver. There is no quality control with the services being provided. My last driver ripped me off, they marked the order as delivered and sent me a picture of them driving past my house. I understand these kinds of things are out of Grubhubs control, but it’s a common problem that happens too often to lots of people. It really ruins the convenience of using the app.",2024-11-26 15:31:55,App Store,GrubHub,,,

Not to mention after an hour of waiting and the ETA growing further and further away I tried to cancel, but couldn't because ""the order was already being processed."" About 20 minutes after recieving a courier Grub Hub cancelled my order due to ""delivery issues."" The fact there's no option to actually chat with customer service is unhelpful and, frankly, ridiculous. only having prefab responses is not remotely helpful and most of those prefab ""solutions"" are to track the order? never again, grubhub.",2024-12-05 15:40:15,App Store,GrubHub,,,
"For the second time in five months my order was mysteriously cancelled hours after being placed. No call from the restaurant. No explanation. I get things happen. But whatever ‘happened’ it would be great if the order was cancelled sooner than 2 hours after I ordered. I order late because I eat dinner late because I work third shift. Other restaurants I could have ordered from closed before my order was cancelled. Both times. 
It’s a real turn off to using this kind of service. I’m already paying a premium for fast food to be delivered this way. The service should be flawless given how expensive it is. 
And yet it comes with unexplained delays which result in… a cancelled order. Both times it was obvious there was some problem long before the order was cancelled. We’re talking a fast food order from a place within 10 minutes of delivery location. I get maybe an hour at most. After that the order should be canceled. I shouldn’t have to wonder where my food and money went for an additional hour. Feels like a cheap Russian mafia operation rather than a sleek Silicon Valley billion dollar tech disruption. 

Back in the Stone Age when I managed a restaurant, if an order took two hours to be delivered, the food was actually delivered, for free, along with a sincere apology from me, and a promise their next order would be free. Because I cared, about them and their repeat business. 

You lost mine.",2024-12-09 13:54:45,App Store,GrubHub,,,

Then after that the driver didn’t listen to the instructions that i said. and proceeded to drop it off at some random house without a care in the world and took a picture like it was something to present, which then required me to then exit my household AT 12 AM on a TUESDAY NIGHT. and make my way around the whole complex just to find my baggy soggy and wet. But before all of this even happened i asked for a refund (keep in mind i never ordered from this buffon of a app before ) they said i already refunded on too many accounts who would take the time out of there to refund something or scam GRUBHUB out of anything. then the lady proceeded to end the chat on me and not help me with my issue whatsoever so no do not order from grubhub stick to uber eats or doordash",2024-12-12 02:54:43,App Store,GrubHub,,,
So I have recently found out if you are unlucky like me and have a hard time ordering out and use special instructions you better hope they never mess up your order. I have had constant issues with delivery service that’s not the actual drivers fault at all. If you have a messed up order of course you report the issue hoping it gets resolved. I unfortunately have to report more orders than most because I am feeding a family of 5 when I order. There is a cap for how much of your money you spent they are willing to give back to you apparently. Even if the order was messed completely up if you hit this cap you are out of luck and they offer you a 5 dollar credit like that will replace the 20 dollar meal. Don’t use the service if you ever expect a refund for messed up food.,2024-12-16 05:24:26,App Store,GrubHub,,,
"The worst thing about GrubHub is the app. From a recent grocery order, I searched for honey, no results at a major grocery store. Go to another app look up the same store - lots of results. Search by the brand name on GH and the honey results come up. Same thing happened with tomatoes.  Lazy searches that only look for the first word instead of a key word. The substitution choices are ridiculous, you can’t do a search to add your specific subs if they aren’t listed and have no place for notes. There is a reason I only use GH when there’s a great deal, because the app is that clunky and in more ways than mentioned here. It’s always a bummer to see a business, especially an online business, that doesn’t think it’s worth it to make a good app.",2024-12-17 20:08:22,App Store,GrubHub,,,

The driver told me to text him the new address which I was hopeful about. I texted the driver my address twice, from the number that was listed on Grubhub. He never responded. I contacted customer service who said they couldn’t do anything for me and that they were going to disconnect the phone. I wasn’t yelling, wasn’t being rude just simply trying to fix an order that cost $50+ dollars (over $10 in fees and taxes) from just vanishing. When the customer service representative said he was going to disconnect, I knew that this company was terrible. Sorry for wasting your time.

He got the supposed Manager on the phone but I don’t think she was. She had absolutely no authority to do anything other than to credit me $7!

The delivery ETA just keeps going up with the clock, and there’s no way for me to cancel or report the issue. I just have to wait for my food to never get here before I can ask for money back or anything. And frankly these days this is what I expect from this app… Even if I get any money back on tonight’s order, I’m fed up with GrubHub’s consistent glitches.

Rest always have an issue either missing items which Grubhub has no way to fix only late. Food is always cold or warm if it’s suppose to stay cold. Always late.

The second representative I spoke to told me it would take 24hrs. It didn’t.

I’m so saddened that I have to type out a review like this. This app used to be my go to for my food. Today I ordered from Dairy Queen and was informed by my delivery driver that their ice cream machine was broken. I thanked him and went to help chat to get it refunded. Apparently due to my other refunds I wasn’t allowed any more refunds? My first thought was.. the nerve of these people to keep my hard earned money for mistakes that weren’t even my fault. After thinking about it and arguing over text and on the phone I was completely fed up. I understand that they do this for people that steal food but if they only investigated further into the problem it’s clear that I have nothing to do with food not arriving due to the store saying they don’t have it. Now they tell me to go through this other long process in order to get my refund. Absolutely not! Grubhub I am appalled at how you treat your plus members. These people will do everything they can to make it harder for you to get your money back. If you would only look into the cause of the refunds further this would never be an issue. I’m done with Grubhub! I recommend using delivery associated directly with the business you want food from or another app that cares more about its customers. I mean all this could have been avoided with a little more effort on their side. The nerve of these people STEALING my hard earned money.,2025-01-08 09:27:46,App Store,GrubHub,,,
The delivery drivers do not always use common sense and frequently cannot find my house because they follow their GPS and turn off of my road and go to the neighborhood behind my house even tho I have it in the delivery instructions to NOT turn off of my road! If an address says “Main St” why would you turn off of Main St to go to a different place ?? They have frequently left my food on the side of the road on the ground behind my house where I have no access to get it unless I get in my car and go search for it. Grubhub doesn’t always help either - almost every time they insist that it was delivered because the driver took a picture of it sitting on the ground along the road when it has not actually been delivered …,2025-01-08 23:44:34,App Store,GrubHub,,,
"I don’t care enough to write reviews usually however I have never had such bad service before. 

I had made an order (did the free + trial), waited probably an hour or so for my food after it said he picked it up and was on the way , it placed for a location 15 minutes away from me when there’s a location 5 minutes from me. I contacted them about it trying to see if they could fix it as it was not allowing me to, they said they couldn’t do anything about it. So I decided I would get over it. I eventually got my food, it was cold like I mean completely cold almost as if the ac was blowing directly on it. I contacted support to have them cancel the subscription as it wasn’t showing up in my settings. They said they canceled it.

Today I got a notification from my bank saying the charge for Grubhub has failed as I transferred my money out of my bank. So I contacted Grubhub support they told me I don’t have a subscription and it only went through because there’s something with my bank. It has been trying to charge for the last week apparently after I looked at my bank statement. So I asked to be transferred to a higher up and I was told that was against Grubhub rules. Now I knew that was a lie because when I contacted support about my food they wouldn’t cancel it so I asked to be transferred to a higher up. After she kept going on about how they can’t do transfers she disconnected the chat. I still haven’t had this problem resolved.",2025-01-09 11:34:41,App Store,GrubHub,,,

Happens all the time. And then they’re delivery people or couriers sometimes don’t deliver your order if they can’t find your apartment and don’t follow instructions and don’t contact you. And then sometimes they pretend they deliver your order when I see them drive right past me in and out of the apartment because I wait outside. They are just TERRIBLE! And they don’t give you a refund if the delivery driver doesn’t deliver your order.

There’s been way too many times where I’ve had to walk around my complex to find my food because the driver couldn’t be bothered to read the big numbers on the doors. I’ll constantly see the drivers driving around in circles somewhere for whatever reason. The worst part is you have to tip them before you get assigned a driver but if you don’t tip well enough you sometime get drivers who harass you over text and wait outside your door to confront you. When I bring this up with support they just offer me $10 in credit. It’s a hassle to cancel your order if you accidentally put in the wrong address or weren’t finished. Even if you try to cancel right after you hit the “place order” button it makes you fuss with a crappy customer service person. You’d think I’d get a little better customer service since I’m a gold member.,2025-01-11 21:10:33,App Store,GrubHub,,,
"It’s all wonderful until something goes wrong! Then you can only talk to them through the CHAT! 

Had a bad experience ordering from a restaurant locally. The food was completely cold, items were missing, or replaced with the wrong items. My issue with GrubHub is that you can only contact them through their chat function and the representatives just copy/paste the same annoying platitudes over and over again. They apologize, but refuse to give you refunds, or want to give you credits. They should have an option to speak to a real representative.

I have had someone just totally not even deliver my order, had it delivered to the wrong house, and had my orders wrong. But everyone aside from once, the drivers don’t even respond to their messages. And when you reach out to help, they not only take forever, but they don’t really help with the issues.

"Where grubhub lacks the most is website functionality and customer service, which are two very essential parts of their service and app. On multiple occasions I have had something go wrong with the app and very poor customer service to go along with it. I had an order that was never sent to the restaurant, so I waited an hour for nothing to arrive. I also had to cancel an order because I had chosen the wrong delivery type, but when I went to do it, the app was having issues and would not let me. By then, it was too late to cancel. Customer service was agin not helpful in accepting the blame for the sites issues and did not give me a refund close to what I had paid. Very frustrating.

"I’ve only used this app a few times, it’s never been great, but we usually actually got the food this last experience had been the worst by far. We ordered pizza today, it was estimated that the pizza would arrive in around an hour. I got a notification later that our pizza was done and our driver was on his way to pick it up from the store.  

Then without the driver contacting me, the delivery time was pushed out an additional 20-50 minutes. We waited until the second delivery time arrived where I was notified by the app that my pizza was delivered, I checked and nothing had been delivered. 

At this point, it’s almost 2 hours after I placed the order. I call the delivery driver, and he said that he pizza had already been picked up, when he went to the store. (Though he did mark it “picked up” and “delivered” on his end?) He said there was nothing he could do to help us that I have to call GrubHub and the store making the pizza. There’s no good way to contact GrubHub or request a refund for this order. For how poor of an experience people seem to have there should be an option for users to mark an order as having not received it on the app. 

I don’t think I’ll ever use GrubHub again, poor service with the driver, both lack of communication on his end, and the fact that after waiting for hours we didn’t even get any food, I don’t recommend. Use DoorDash or something.",2025-01-27 03:46:02,App Store,GrubHub,,,

"If you’re looking for a food delivery app that consistently gets your order wrong, delivers ice-cold food, or just never shows up at all, Grubhub is the way to go. My experiences with this app have been nothing short of frustrating, and I’m convinced it’s the worst of the bunch.

First off, missing items are practically guaranteed. It doesn’t matter if you triple-check your order—something will always be left out. And good luck getting a refund or any kind of meaningful customer service. Their “support” team usually gives canned responses and leaves you hanging.

Then there’s the wait time. If you’re expecting your food within the estimated delivery window, think again. Delays are the norm, not the exception. I’ve had orders arrive over an hour late, and sometimes, they never show up at all. The best part? You’ll still be charged, and getting a refund is a battle.

With all the competition out there, there’s no reason to keep using Grubhub when other services are more reliable. If you enjoy cold, incomplete meals and endless frustration, by all means, give it a try. Otherwise, save yourself the headache and go with literally any other food delivery app.",2025-02-06 17:32:55,App Store,GrubHub,,,

Not wanting to throw good money after bad I placed an order today as I  noted the highway robbery-like fees born from a greed burdened fabrication of some extensive service they state they provide.  These fees totaled over half of the 20 dollar meal.  When attempting to use a restaurant (Chipotle) gift card the incompetence of their application became apparent.  The gift card contains only 16 numbers and yet this ridiculous company would only allow a 17 number entry to be applied; this seems to be either incompetence or intentionally done with the idea of screwing over the end user.

"I’m coming from the perspective of a college student whose school relies on GrubHub to order all food. This app is poorly designed, unreliable and needs to be overhauled. First of all, the app is confusing, with completely separate but similar looking interfaces for off and on campus dining. To make things worse there’s a switch for delivery vs pickup which completely separates the interface again. You have to decide this before even selecting a restaurant to get your food from or else you have to go all the way back to the beginning of your order. Also there’s no easy way to save common spots, and not an easy way to search for locations so every single time I order, I’m scrolling through a long menu to find my location. Not to mention that I’m constantly getting logged out of the app, causing even more issues.

It seems that the first driver must have declined. The restaurant apologized for the delay and found someone willing to deliver. He did it with a smile. I don’t know the real reason I have this problem. I have heard these reasons, “ parking is tough “, or  I must go to the lobby to get my order. I understand “driver safety and “independent contractor”.  I live in a secure condo on the 7th floor.  There are two elevators. Deliveries are made frequently. I always tip generously. I have no idea about delivery area but I order from restaurants clos to me. The last order was from a restaurant farther away than usual but still in the area. Could distance be a problem?

My place is tricky to find, and I have a bad leg, and every single time they show up at the wrong place. And increasingly, the drivers do not speak English so I can’t even communicate with them. I understand they want to hire diversely, but I believe basic English should be requirement for a delivery driver. I have called customer service numerous times and they literally just repeat the same phrase is over and over and say they will say something to someone about it. Seriously considering canceling this. I get a deal through my Prime membership but is becoming not worth it.",2025-02-25 21:00:30,App Store,GrubHub,,,
"Don’t bother. This service has gotten so slow and unbearable to use. If you place an order, expect the order to either show up 3-4 hours late or not at all. When you reach out to customer service, all they can do is offer you a $5 credit which covers nothing. Drivers take multiple orders at a time so your food will always be delivered cold. Customer service is outsourced to India so good luck getting ahold of anyone or getting issues resolved. I only use the service because it is free through Prime, but I’m done after this last experience. If you like cold food, horrible customer service, and wasted time, then this is the app for you!",2025-03-01 01:17:56,App Store,GrubHub,,,
"Over the past year, I’ve had to use Grubhub only as a last resort because several times they’ll make crucial errors like:
1. Showing a restaurant as open and letting me order from it but when the delivery person gets there - it’s either closed or doesn’t exist.
2. Not sending a delivery person AT ALL. So the restaurant and I are both waiting forever thinking maybe it’s just delayed, only for me to contact support and find out that cancellation is the only option. I kept waiting, because on the tracking it says that they’re waiting for the food to be prepared. The truth being that the food is cold now because no one came to pick it up.
Insanity for an app whose main service is supposed to be delivery.",2025-03-02 20:17:23,App Store,GrubHub,,,
Door Dash has been so difficult to deal with in trying to re-activate my account.  The help center was completely unhelpful.  I have been temporarily living with my daughter in NC and have not had a problem with Grub hub delivering to her address with my credit card address being in another state whereas Door Dash wanted the two to line up before I could reactivate the account.  Grub Hub has been excellent to do business with. On a whole other issue when I was trying to order from the same Indian Rest from Door Dash they listed the rice as an additional purchase as if the rice did not come with the dish and was needed to be purchased seperatly.  I called the rest to verify that the rice did indeed come with the ordered dish of which they answered yes it was not necessary to order it optionally.  I went to Grub hub and they had the dish listed as is not with the rice as an option. I am so disappointed in Door Dash but so happy to do business with Grub Hub.,2025-03-03 23:41:50,App Store,GrubHub,,,
"Do not give someone a gift card to this place. Waste of about 2 hours and someone else’s money. Worst experience ever. 3 customer care reps lied and said they fixed the problem when they did not and leaving the chat to check if they followed through, ends the chat.
All in all worst experience of a night. Driver was incapable of driving to pick it up. For 2 hours they were “picking it up”. Parked in a neighborhood for most of it and a parking lot a couple blocks away from the store. 
Waiting 2 hours for food, being told to wait for the new eta - 20 minutes additional to the original time - repeatedly from 3 customer care reps in the chat that never helped.
I have screenshots of how deliberately unfortunate all of it was but there is no place to do that on this platform.

"Used grubhub for years. I will no longer be use this app. I had a couple instances where it says the order is on its way, to then be the order be assigned to a different driver moments later. You go and leave a complaint about the order being late and they just tell you is the ETA. How does my order be on its way, then not? Why is the driver sitting at the restaurant for 10-15 minutes, supposedly “on its way” to then be changed to a different driver. They tell you can get $5 back for late deliveries, but they change the ETA so that you can’t get their “guarantee”. Other instances that keep occurring is the driver straight up not delivering the food. They take a pic of the order inside their car and just drive away with it. too many times.",2025-03-09 05:20:51,App Store,GrubHub,,,
"I don’t know if this is specifically when trying to order Wendy’s Saucy Nuggs or if it happens elsewhere, but it says to select four sauces and gives you the option to make all of them the same or to have less than four sauces. (Currently the only one available is ranch.) There are no other required choices to make, but when you are finished choosing your sauces, it still says you need to make the required choices. I don’t know what those choices could be, and even if I did, the optional choice I see below the sauce is unavailable to me as well.",2025-03-10 22:49:28,App Store,GrubHub,,,
"I tried grubhub for the first time and the first order I got was at a fast food restaurant and it was night time, my food didn’t arrive and im guessing the driver stole it (which happens a lot) so instead of sending me food again they just refunded me the money, since I got the money back I js told myself I’ll js order it again tomorrow since I wasn’t craving fast food during those time. Almost 2 week passed I never used grubhub anymore because of that issue, and yet still took the risk to use grubhub again and this time I got my order but the issue again was I got the wrong food I ordered and so I contacted customer service and what they just told me was they can’t do anything about it because there’s something going on with my account that had a refund before (which was my first ever order on grubhub) and I explained that to them and I was shocked they closed the chat without letting me finish.",2025-03-11 02:50:54,App Store,GrubHub,,,
"I’ve been using this app for four months and in just that little time it’s gone down hill. First, they stopped indicating the delivery fee for each restaurant so you don’t know how much it costs until you’re at check out. Then I started having trouble getting a refund for botched orders. I used to be able to submit a problem and get a refund instantly but now I don’t trust them to give me my money back at all. And after having a few orders either take over an hour to get to me or not arrive at all, I’m done. I don’t even live that far away from the places I’m ordering and, admittedly, I could go myself and get food in ten minutes and save money. But it’s about the convenience and this app does not make getting a simple meal convenient. Between untrustworthy drivers and the company making bad decisions, I would stay away from this app.",2025-03-13 03:23:58,App Store,GrubHub,,,
"Wish I can say their app needs work and service is excellent, we can trade no so nice tech over bad service any day especially when it comes to food, on average it anyways takes 45min to an hour or more to deliver on top of it 6 out of 10 times they mess it up, delivery drivers complain they’re not supported by the company, the refuse to deliver, sometimes it’s delivered elsewhere or someone else’s food is delivered to us and the driver shares our number so those people call us and ask where’s their food, imagine the ridiculousness of this… then there are times they just don’t deliver and upload fake picture of delivery like one min on tracking it’s at the restaurant second minute you get a notification that the food was delivered… customer service apologize profusely and end chat, noted, here’s $5-$7 and the same story repeats, so frustrating, they’ve taken joy out of everything.",2025-03-19 23:46:49,App Store,GrubHub,,,
"I dont know what’s been going on with this app lately, It tells me stores are closed when they’re not, almost every fast food place i click on says closed.  the search function does not work AT ALL, tried searching ‘milkshake’ no results found, tried ‘mcdonalds’ no results found, ‘food’ no results found.  when i click a store that’s open it tells me “this store is pickup only” which is a lie because once you switch to pickup order, and switch back to delivery, it lets you order it.  last week I ordered a milkshake and the delivery time was supposed to be 35 minutes, when 35 minutes was up, it said “new delivery time 1:45-2 hours, i had to text the customer service for 30 minutes before they would give me a refund. this app used to be amazing, now it feels like an employee is trying to sabotage the company",2025-03-22 07:31:22,App Store,GrubHub,,,
"I am very displeased with this app and especially displeased with their customer service. I accidentally pressed place order button and immediately contacted customer service because I wanted to alter the order (add more items and possibly take out one item and replace it with another one). Not even 1 minute (60 seconds) went by before I was in contact with customer service rep via chat inside app. I explained my situation and they would not let me get what I needed. It didn’t require simply adding 1 item but I just needed more time. Again, I accidentally hit the submit order button and immediately contacted customer service. Due to not being able to alter my order the way that I needed and customer service rep was like, sorry, too bad, my friend left and I ate alone because we couldn’t order a second time due to the high cost of using this app what with all the fees and no half price appetizers (Applebees). My order total was close to $100. But again, I just spent the night eating alone and regretting ever using this app. Unless you’re a gazillionaire and don’t mind waisting money, this app isn’t for you. Very displeased with the poor customer service I received. Never again grubhub, you just lost a good tipper. I still left a 30% tip on my order. I’m never ordering from you people again :(((((((((((((((((((",2025-03-22 21:41:42,App Store,GrubHub,,,
"I have given this company multiple chances, twice everything was fine. However, the last three times in a row. My food has arrived cold and been sitting out for so long that it is now a health and safety concern. That last line was inexcusable. It took over an hour and a half for my food to be delivered from Halal guys. By the time it got to my door, it wasn’t even lukewarm. I did not feel comfortable eating it at that point so I requested a refund. They refunded the $4 french fries and gave me a five dollar credit towards my next purchase. I spent just over $30. I am so sick and tired of being overcharged for food to have it show up at my door inedible. I’ve canceled my plus, request requested my information be deleted, and taken the app off my phone. Have the day you deserve Grubhub. May your food always be late and cold.",2025-03-23 05:28:53,App Store,GrubHub,,,
"On several occasions now, food has been delivered late. This was the worst and last straw. We placed our order at 10pm. It was picked up 10:59pm, which was the initial estimated delivery time. Fine, that happens. Th delivery driver then proceeded to arrive at 11:40pm, when the drive was maybe 10 minutes if that. Talking to an initial customer service agent, she explained the driver had multiple orders but to rest assured as their drivers had “warming bags.” Our food was cold upon arrival. Not slightly warm, cold. Another service agent echoed the first’s sentiments; both saying they could not provide a refund. My family is staying at a hotel for vacation, so we had no method for rewarming the food. Though honestly, I wouldn’t feel safe eating it anyway. I am beyond frustrated and would not recommend GrubHub to anyone. They lack punctuality and have zero customer service. Account deleted.",2025-03-27 05:04:35,App Store,GrubHub,,,
"What a nightmare. On Friday night I ordered Taco Bell. The order is 1 hour late and the driver delivers it to the wrong building. GH processes a redelivery. This next order takes 2 hours. Customer care just kept deflecting with “oh this isn’t the experience we want you to have here is $5”. I eventually ended up getting a $17 credit. 

Fast forward to Sunday AM and I’m ready to use this credit and just give it another try. Nope - same deal. I wait 1 hour for IHOP pancakes and deal with the same copy and paste replies from Customer Care. In my chat with her I said 3x please do not give me a credit I won’t use this app anymore. But that was still all she came up with. After 1.5 hours of relentless griping on my end, I was able to get my order canceled and refunded. 

Avoid this hassle at all costs and use DoorDash. GrubHub is messy.",2025-03-30 13:30:35,App Store,GrubHub,,,
"Every order I have ever placed is always late or just takes forever. My food sits there at the restaurant getting cold and by the time it gets to me it’s soggy and cold. Not sure if this is due to a lack of drivers in my area but Uber Eats never has this issue. This is not an exaggeration, EVERY single order has taken over 1 hour to get delivered after the food is ready at the restaurant. Even when it’s been 10 minutes down the road. One time it took so long I just gave up and went and picked the order up myself. When I got there the restaurant told me my food had been marked ready for over an hour and they felt so bad for me that they remade all my food. 

I also don’t like that you cannot change your Tip afterwards like you can in Uber Eats. The fact that you tip before even knowing how food the service was is ridiculous in the first place but to then no allow you to remove the Tip if you get poor service is even worse. Had a driver literally set my food on the ground in pesticide once even though I put explicit instructions not to set my order on the ground and to set it on the table I have outside just for this. He set it on the ground still when the table was 2 feet away.",2025-03-30 15:13:39,App Store,GrubHub,,,
"My first experience and order with them was horrible. There must be some sort of glitch in their system but they refused to refund me for their apps mistake and take accountability. I ordered it said it was canceled and I’d get a refund due to 1 of the stores not being open—got it so I ordered on DD. 
Got my food from DD and the order I wanted but GH said was closed. As Im halfway through eating the DD when GH knocked and came to deliver the initial order. So they lied and it did go through and got delivered. Now I’m stuck with duplicate charges and cold food from GH because the app is janky. 
DoorDash and UberEats are so much better. In the time it took for GH app to say canceled and  glitch to assign a driver anyway and then deliver it with no notification to me—I had already finished my donuts and bagel from DD bc their better and quicker. The GH food was cold and half my drink was missing.",2025-04-03 15:56:02,App Store,GrubHub,,,
"I’m hard of hearing AND have vocal cord paralysis. I have put that in my instructions that I cannot talk over the phone without hurting my voice (if I can even hear you) ON TOP OF selecting text notification. But instead everybody and their mother wants to CALL me when I CANNOT TALK OR HEAR. And when I tried to figure out how to reach out to customer service I kept running into FAQs instead of an option to call or chat. I found a number through Google and called customer service which I shouldn’t have to. I CANNOT COMMUNICATE VERBALLY, but Grubhub left me no choice and I had to use an inhaler after the call from all the air I had to pass through my vocal cords to make noise. Deleted my account and will be deleting the app. I have been relying on delivery a lot since even going to the grocery store or a drive-thru is nearly impossible for me to do anymore with my communication issues (I bring a whiteboard or type on my phone but people can’t or won’t read anymore, and I can’t always have a friend or relative around to help translate if I NEED something) so this was beyond a disappointment.",2025-04-05 16:15:27,App Store,GrubHub,,,

I got a message saying that it was a menu issue and my order would not be placed, and I was receiving a full refund. I called or chatted with GrubHub and the only thing that they could say was that I’m sorry, but it was an issue on the food and even though for an hour I was expecting food. All they could offer me was the maximum $10 credit which doesn’t even pay to have another meal brought in for the inconvenience of having to wait over an hour to be told that my food would never arrive.

"I was a frequent and LOYAL customer who ordered food from here almost every other day This week, I ordered my food and the app said my order was delivered. My order was not delivered and there was no delivery picture. The driver simply did not deliver my order. Customer service told me many times that they will not be giving me a refund. I asked them many times because I thought they didn’t understand the situation…. it’s worse that they understood and didn’t care.  That is a terrible way to lose your customers, ESPECIALLY loyal ones. I cannot afford to order on this app and not receive my food. I do not like the way customer service treats their customers. I informed Grubhub that I will now be using DOORDASH for all of my future orders :) Please consider treating loyal customers (and all customers) with respect and kindness in the future.
UPDATE: They literally gave me the same driver, as I ordered from the app due to the last resort. I am disgusted they gave me the same driver, who was supppperrr creepy and made me come up to his car… crazy that they STILL didn’t consider a refund. Clearly this app is disorganized and has stuff going on behind the scenes. Doordash will now be the service I use at work as well until Grubhub fixes things.",2025-04-08 17:44:35,App Store,GrubHub,,,
"Will never use again. My son is in the hospital after a major hip surgery. He was very specific about what he wanted for his first real meal. After over 3 hours we still hadn’t received our food. Finally someone was headed to the restaurant. I called the restaurant and asked if the food was sitting out or if the food was being made. He let me know that our food had been sitting there for over 3 hrs, before he got there and he is the manager. Right after i hung up with the terrible manager, Grubhub cancelled our order. The said all I can do is reorder on the app and gave a small credit. Now our food is once again, an hour from being delivered. Let see if we ever get it. 0 confidence.

If you order something and there are any issues with the order or delivery you would think you could tell them and they would fix it. We have not used this app in 4 years. We order pizza and didn’t receive the order. I called grubhub and they said it’s the pizza places responsibility. The store replied that since we ordered via grubhub that it was their responsibility. Makes sense. Grubhub then said I receached a cancellation limit. I asked how many cancellations is the limit since I’ve never use the app and they said they didn’t know how many they just can’t help and the money can’t be refunded either. Long story short…. We paid for something. Didn’t get it. Was never notified of a limit or with  no refunds disclaimer. Grubhub robbed us of $50.,2025-04-14 19:54:23,App Store,GrubHub,,,
"The location marker in the app does not correspond with the address location in Google Maps and there is no movable pin to set the correct location. The app literally sends the driver to a totally different location every single time. DO NOT USE THIS APP, YOUR FOOD WILL BE LOST AND THEY DO NOTHING ABOUT IT. Every single other app, DoorDash, Lyft and Uber can find the correct address. Grubhub will say you have to update Google Maps which I did. Google Maps updated to the correct location. Grubhub did not update accordingly. This app and the company are pure trash. They are extremely incompetent and have no intelligence. They’re incapable of fixing their software to pull in the updated location in Google Maps and you will never get a person to speak to, they will stiff arm you with an AI bot and steal your money.
