"In the past few months, it seems that the quality of customer service AND drivers has declined. In my past several orders, I have had missing items, and it seems to be due to mistakes made by drivers, in that they aren't checking the receipt to make sure they have collected all the items in my order. Additionally, though I have added clear instructions, drivers frequently misplace my orders or provide photos that don't show an obvious location, meaning I have to search my entire building.",2025-04-18 23:49:06,0,2,Google Play,GrubHub

"Been using this for a while. Their drivers often don't check the receipt and will not deliver the entire order. This happens commonly with drinks, you being charged and the drink not being delivered, but sometimes happens with other items too.

here's a summary that perfectly describes grubhub. you order something and try to me nice and tip the highest amount to the driver. the driver can't legally open your bag and check that you have everything. you get your order and things are missing. you get with grubhub help and they reimburse you for the base cost of the item. you just lost more money because you tried to be nice in tipping the highest amount. that seems unfair. they di nothing to fix your actual spending for an order. thanks,2025-04-08 20:47:47,1,1,Google Play,GrubHub

I re-downloaded today and instantly remembered why I quit grubhub in the 1st place. I put in my address it kept defaulting to an old one. I finally get it to switch to my new address. it tells me I can't order from there now. fair enough. I empty my cart it gives the SAME restaurant as an option but all the food is at least a dollar more expensive and the fees are higher. so the same order was legitimate 15 dollars more and tge real kicker... the restaurant is closer lol back to door dash I go,2025-04-01 19:35:23,0,1,Google Play,GrubHub

The app is fine but as a company GrubHub (in my opinion) is pretty terrible. Orders are consistently late or get cancelled because they can't find a driver. If you have no drivers then there needs to be a way keep us from ordering in the first place or at least let us know how many are working so customers can get a sense of real time availability.

There is a serious glitch right now. Just lost 2/3's of an order and this is not the first time. Currently if you place an order with Priority Delivery and your order is late you receive an automatic refund. This prevents you from opening a support ticket for that order because the app views the $1 delivery refund as a resolved case. Last time I only lost a coffee but this time I lost two full meals worth $20 each and the AI bot you can access through Help only offered $5 in credit.,2025-03-14 17:56:25,3,1,Google Play,GrubHub

Better to order directly through the restaurant and pick up yourself. It's cheaper, the restaurant gets more of their money, and you don't get scammed by the delivery app or driver.",2025-03-08 10:20:37,0,1,Google Play,GrubHub

The app isn't the issue it's the service itself. They need to update their system to what DD uses or something similar. They are so slow it takes 2 hrs to get an order from a place that's 10 minutes away. Yeah I can get it myself but not the point. I'm not always able to get out and I'm willing to pay for it to be delivered to me and I actually tip well. Drivers get lost or take weird ways to get to my house and it takes them longer.

"The service is kinda awful. They overcharge on everything, add hidden fees, and their drivers make a lot of mistakes. They also allow (and I believe encourage) their drivers to double dip on orders, meaning you'll place an order and then need to wait for the driver to pick up a 2nd order and deliver it before you get yours. This always results in cold and late food. Then they make it difficult to reach anyone to get help.

"Absolutely unacceptable service fees.

Grub hub is awful. Drivers mess up orders all the time and they don't take care of you.

"This app used to be great! You could order, and you'd get your food within 30-45 minutes still nice and hot, and it would be correct everytime. Now your driver will have at least 2 stops every time. Most likely your order will be wrong, and it takes nearly an hour to get it! If it were just one or two times, I'd understand. But literally the last 3 or 4 times I ordered it was late, missing stuff.

GrubHub is the only service involving transactions that I have used that does not apply gift card credits by default. And then trying to get the credit applied after the order is a headache. They do not give their customer support a line of escalation and simply say there is nothing they can do. I believe this is an intentional tactic to make it more difficult to use gift credit and this increasing the usage of their app.,2025-01-19 20:41:04,4,1,Google Play,GrubHub

Awful. I placed an order for a location 0.2 miles away. It was delayed 3 times over the course of 1 hour and the restraint closed. Customer service told me to wait for the order after explaining this to them. Another 30 minutes of wasted time and I finally got him to refund me my money. He kept saying I should wait for the order like I was talking to a brick wall.,2025-01-12 23:46:24,0,1,Google Play,GrubHub

Customer service are no help with no situation whatsoever the delivery drivers are bad and they do not like to give you your money back when it's their fault on the situation I recommend Uber eats order anybody but GrubHub for your food and customer service experience cuz you're not going to get nowhere and they will hold your money and not want to give you a refund after you order food I highly suggest never to order from them and the customer service is foreign and barely speak English,2025-01-12 12:28:47,1,1,Google Play,GrubHub

I said I'll come out to get the food. The app showed the driver getting closer and closer, then drive in a circle around us, twice, then drove away. They never called.

IS THIS EVEN LEGAL?? TO DELIVER FOOD TO ANITHER PERSONS HOUSE AND THEN PICK IT UP AND DELIVER IT TO AN9THER? DOUBT IT!

Gave them a final chance. My food was driving around for over an hour and never made it close to my house. I had them cancel the order. That is 5 for 5 fails for GrubHub. Not much of a delivery service since the driver ends up with my food every time.,2024-10-31 23:03:00,0,1,Google Play,GrubHub

Great. I am a truck driver and use all over even at 2am. Never had a problem. Food is delivered when said and always correct. It's a life saver when driving to get food is not an option,2024-10-31 20:50:36,0,5,Google Play,GrubHub
"Worst delivery app Ive used. I have ordered from numerous stores and had those orders cancelled out of thin air. My last order was a pizza that was over an hour late so I cancelled. They offer this service to restaurants that drove themselves, so they have no control of the situation and no was to make it a positive experience. This isn't worth the freebee Amazon gives on it.

first time using this app and I did not receive any discounts any coupons or anything for my first time using this app. GrubHub is trash. at least you get 20% off your first order with Uber eats.,2024-10-31 10:19:10,0,1,Google Play,GrubHub
I have clear instructions to knock on door or ring bell and not to just leave food outside. Drivers never knock or ring bell. Food always left outside. Often on ground and directly in front of door making it extremely hard or even impossible to open door without knocking sodas over. Are they really that stupid or they just don't care since they already got tip?,2024-10-31 09:25:57,2,1,Google Play,GrubHub
"Location never updates on its own. App gives estimated delivery times that are wildly off, leading me to often wait 2 hours for food delivery. Customer Service is horrendous. Even something as simple as canceling the order requires a chat with a rep. Not user friendly, includes restaurants from 25 miles away, and often don't have breakfast offering in my area. Between this and uber eats failing me multiple times I'm sticking with doordash.",2024-10-31 08:12:07,11,1,Google Play,GrubHub

I lived in some random place in West Virginia so I downloaded Uber eats and doordash to see what restaurants they have on there and I got restaurants but GrubHub didn't even had one business on their. I'm not surprised because I live in the middle of nowhere West Virginia and if I lived in a highly populated area I probably wouldn't have this problem but again doordash and Uber eats did have businesses so that.,2024-10-30 22:00:22,0,2,Google Play,GrubHub

Used this a few times and the first few times were pretty good. Using it now though and orders end missing parts of the meal. Grubhub needs to do better with who they have delivering food to people and most importantly have communication.,2024-10-30 17:46:30,0,3,Google Play,GrubHub

It's late most of the time. I'm not sure if it is the lack of drivers or the app isn't providing the proper predictions.

Drivers take order to wrong address frequently. Food is often cold upon receipt. Problem resolution is only helpful to a point.

It's pretty good. Only issues is that I can't always rate the orders when prompted and it's frustrating to see restaurants that are closer to me than the ones listed not be available. Taco Bell is within the same parking lot as McDonald's but I can't order McDonald's when I can order Taco Bell.

BAD FOR BUSINESS - BAD FOR USERS. Did you know several restaurants charge more when you order through Grubhub? Apps like these not only charge users fees - but restaurants as well.

Let's just say hope you have your order actually delivered and/or no issues. Once you deal with customer service for this company it all goes downhill. Short update. Still do do.

Since Prime took over the fees are now there all the time. The waived fee was just basically doubled with Prime but you'll get minimal discounts now.

"Does not comply with their lowest price guarantee. I found my order at a lower price with a competitor, at $15 dollars less.

In which it 100% did comply with every 5 of the terms. Then without answering my question, they ended my call and blocked the conversation. Do not trust them. Price gouging at its finest!!

Last time I am using this app. Majority of the time I place an order and it comes late and it's always at the times I really need something quick where I don't have time to cook or have anything to eat. I end up skipping lunch because of the lack of drivers and them trying to stack too many orders at one time. Grubhub should not allow drivers to do that with too many orders at once. And they don't give you a refund when the order has to be canceled by them. it's ridiculous.,2024-09-17 13:21:50,1,1,Google Play,GrubHub

Do not use them. They are consistently late. I've ordered from multiple restaurants that are not busy and only a mile away. I've also ordered during high and low traffic times.

The fees are also outrageous even with free GrubHub plus it is still making any 18$ meal into a 30$ meal before tipping. Absolutely ridiculously bad and unhelpful customer service as well. Do not use this application.,2024-08-24 15:35:52,1,1,Google Play,GrubHub
$45 for $25 worth of food is crazy. I had a gift card from work to burn. But one delivery told me that I will never use GrubHub ever again with this nuts pricing. This feels like an app that keeps poor people poor,2024-08-24 15:29:02,1,1,Google Play,GrubHub

Large delivery fee mandatory tipping even for bad drivers tipping starts at 20% and service fee on top of the Iarge delivery fee and despite what the website says it's credit card only. Plus long wait times after it's already supposed to have been delivered. They charge you tax on fee's and keep it for themselves. Not kidding they take subtotal+delivery fee+service fee+ small total fee then charge tax when the restaurant charges tax on the subtotal.,2024-06-24 10:42:55,2,1,Google Play,GrubHub
prices since GrubHub started have made food delivery insanely expensive. have you noticed the astronomical price of going out to dinner in the last 3 years? food delivery needs it's cut and so do the shareholders who have invested in an app to pair delivery drivers and restaurants. Just tell me the delivery charge and please don't charge the restaurant. The drivers are nice and I've only had my food delayed once using GrubHub.,2024-06-23 20:12:57,1,2,Google Play,GrubHub
Typically when tipping delivery drivers most people want to wait and see how long they're going to take and if they're there hella fast they usually give out a good tip and if it takes 3 hours like it took today you don't get a tip so maybe think about that,2024-06-23 19:39:56,1,1,Google Play,GrubHub

I decided to give this a decent shake since Amazon prime added but I swear to God every other delivery with this app is sent to the land of oz.

I will never ever use Grubhub again! The first issue I had was when the driver didn't read the instructions and left my food on a table at my job. They noted the driver. The second time my food was so late it was mushy and unappetizing. They gave me a $5 credit and said they would reimburse for the things that were trash. I never got the refund. Last chance my food never came. They said there was nothing they would do because of the other complaints. Never got the food or my money! Use Uber!,2024-06-12 14:13:42,0,1,Google Play,GrubHub

Why do you not provide proper refunds and take peoples money when your drivers do not check items properly and deliver the wrong items all the time or do not deliver some items and will not submit a refund when they know an item is missing?

My delivery never arrived. The customer service chat was only able to apologize and refund the order after suggesting that I wait longer just to see if it arrived. It didn't and I ended up just canceling it at which point it was too late to make a new order from that restaurant or a similar one. And all the customer service could do was just apologize and do a refund. I'm not saying I want free meal but maybe a coupon or something to acknowledge the lost time.,2024-05-24 00:35:18,0,1,Google Play,GrubHub

"I understand some people love GrubHub, but it really irritates me that no one accepts cash as payment for delivery. I'm sorry, but some of us don't have a credit card to pay for the food items or whatever. I really think that everyone should offer a cash payment upon delivery choice at checkout. I mean, not everyone just places like McDonald's or Taco Bell or a convenience store ü§î ü§∑??",2024-05-17 09:25:47,0,3,Google Play,GrubHub
This app should be 0 stars. Can't rate drvers. They don't follow directions or take pictures. Didn't even call me. I can't find my food. They always hand it to somebody else. Tried calling..only voice mail.,2024-05-17 00:28:56,11,1,Google Play,GrubHub
Every time I use grubhub my order always comes with things missing and looks like the food is tampered with so I am over it. I am deleting the acct and will continue to use door dash.

Very slow delivery. My order was just down the street from me. My baby was sleeping so I created the order so whenever he woke up we could eat. They over charge on the food then on top of that charge you service fees etc then on top of that they want you to tip. Why would I tip if I don't recieve my order till hours later? And not only that I tip based off service. I update the tip after the order arrives. For all the problems I don't Recommend,2024-05-02 23:22:04,0,1,Google Play,GrubHub

"GH promotes GrubHub+ by saying ""The truth is, food tastes even better when you spend less on delivery. See details below."" The real truth is, they can give you those discounts by not paying their drivers for their miles AND time. So, if you don't tip the drivers enough up front to make up for what GrubHub isn't paying them, don't be surprised if your food doesn't make it to you, doesn't taste right, or is partially eaten.

"Awesome. The best. Love it. Amazing. Life changing. I'm a better person because of it. Nothing even comes close. I have to go to the bathroom. Bye. Update, the night previous I left a review for a restaurant, not the driver, that was 3 stars. Now I order again tonight, my husband's idea, and I can't leave another review! Another restaurant I order from frequently, I gave positive reviews and each time I order from them I'm given the opportunity to leave another review.

"Very inconsistent with both deliveries and customer care. No significant compensation for last minute cancelled orders aka you could be left hanging last minute with only a refund.
